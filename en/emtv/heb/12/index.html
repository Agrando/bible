For what son is there whom a father does not discipline?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if you are without discipline, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected us, and we respected [them.] Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they indeed disciplined us for a few days, as seemed best to them, but He [disciplines us ]for [our] good, so that we may partake of His holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now no discipline seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, later it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those having been trained by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore strengthen the hands which are weakened, and the feeble knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your feet, so that the lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pursue peace and holiness with all [people], without which no one shall see the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>looking diligently lest anyone fall from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness growing up cause trouble, and through this many be defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest there be any fornicator or profane [person] like Esau, who in exchange for one meal gave up his birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you know that indeed afterward, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, having sought it out diligently with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you have not come to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and to a whirlwind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and to a sound of a trumpet and to a voice of words, which those who heard begged that no further word be spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they could not bear that [which] was commanded: "And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And so fearful was the spectacle, [that] Moses said, "I am greatly afraid and trembling."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have come to Zion, to the Mountain and city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the general assembly and church of the firstborn having been enrolled in [the] heavens, to God the Judge of all, and to spirits of just men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better things than the [blood] of Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape, having refused Him who warned [them], how much more [shall we not escape] if we turn away from Him who warns from heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, "Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now the [phrase], "Yet once more,"signifies the removal of the things being shaken, as having been made, so that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, since we are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
