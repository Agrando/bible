But we exhort you, brothers, that you increase more and more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and that you aspire to be quiet, and to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>in order that you may walk decently toward those that are outside, and may have need of nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you be sorrowful as those who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose [again], thus also God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall by no means precede those who are asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a word of command, with [the] voice of an archangel, and with [the] trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then we who are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then comfort one another with these words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
