[yea,] and I rejoice with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the same reason you also rejoice and rejoice together with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your circumstances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no one like-minded, who will be genuinely concerned about your circumstances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For all seek their own interests, not the things of Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you know his approved character, that as a child with his father he served as a slave for the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I may see how my circumstances go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I have been persuaded in the Lord that I myself will also come shortly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my needs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For indeed he was sick, [and ]near death; but God showed mercy [on] him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I sent him more eagerly, in order that when you see him again you may have joy, and I may be less anxious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him therefore in the Lord with the utmost joy, and hold such [ones] in honor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because for the work of Christ he drew near unto death, being careless with his life, in order that he might fill up that which was lacking in your service to me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
