Nevertheless in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayer and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be ashamed, but with utmost boldness, as always, now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me, to live [is] Christ, and to die [is] gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I am to live on in the flesh, this to me will mean fruit from my labor; and what I shall choose I do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I am hard pressed by the two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, [which is] far better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to remain in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having been persuaded of this, I know that I shall remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my coming again to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only conduct yourselves worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and not being terrified in anything by your enemies, which is to them a proof of destruction, but to you of salvation, and this from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to you it has been granted for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same struggle which you saw in me and now you hear is in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
