For me to write the same things to you is not troublesome, but for you it is safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the [false] circumcision!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For we are the [true] circumcision, worshipping by the Spirit of God, rejoicing in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>although I also [am] having confidence in the flesh. If any other [person] thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I even more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>circumcised the eighth day, of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; with respect to the law, a Pharisee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>with respect to zeal, persecuting the church; with respect to righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But such things as were gain to me, these I have considered loss for the sake of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>More than that I also consider all things to be loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have sustained the loss of all things, and I consider them to be rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through [the] faith of Christ, the righteousness [which is] of God by faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[so as] to know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>if in some way I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not that I have already obtained, or have already been made perfect; but I press on, if also I may lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Brothers, I do not count myself to have laid hold; but one thing[ I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those things which are ahead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I press toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, as many as are mature, let us think this way; and if in anything you think otherwise, even this God will reveal to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Nevertheless, to what we have attained, let us walk by the same rule, [being] of the same mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be fellow imitators of me, brothers, and look out for those walking this way, just as you have us for a pattern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For many walk, of whom often I was speaking to you, and now even weeping I tell you, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame-who are mindful of earthly things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For our citizenship exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who will transform our lowly body, that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
