Again I will say, rejoice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and petition, along with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, brothers, as many things as are true, as many as are honorable, as many as are just, as many as are pure, as many as are lovely-if there is any virtue and if there is any praise-meditate on these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, practice these things; and the God of peace shall be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now once [again] you have revived your mindfulness on my behalf, inasmuch as indeed you were mindful, but you lacked opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that I am speaking with respect to need, for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. In every place and in all [circumstances] I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless you have done well that you shared in my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now you Philippians also know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, no church shared with me in an accounting of giving and receiving except you only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because even in Thessalonica, both once and again you sent for my need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which is increasing to your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I have all things and abound. I have been made full, having received from Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And my God will supply all your need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All the saints greet you, but especially those of the household of Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
