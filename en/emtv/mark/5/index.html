And no one could bind him, not even with chains,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because he often had been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been broken, and no one was able to subdue him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and bruising himself with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and crying out with a great voice he said, "What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For He was saying to him, "Come out from the man, unclean spirit!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He was asking him, "What is your name?"And he answered, saying, "My name is Legion; for we are many."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he was imploring Him many [times] that He would not send them out of the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there near the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So all the demons implored Him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that we may enter them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And immediately Jesus gave them permission. And when the unclean spirits came out, they entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, (there were about two thousand) and drowned in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But those feeding the pigs fled, and they reported it in the city and in the country. And they came out to see what it was that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they came to Jesus, and observed him who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and having been clothed and being of sound mind, and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those who saw it related to them how it happened to him who had been demon-possessed, and about the pigs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they began to implore Him to go away from their region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when He got into the boat, he who had been demon-possessed implored Him that he might be with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, "Go home to your own family, and report to them all the things that the Lord has done for you, and how He had compassion on you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all the things Jesus did for him; and all were marveling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd was gathered to Him; and He was beside the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus. And seeing Him, he fell at His feet</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and was imploring Him many [times], saying, "My little daughter is near death, please come and lay Your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He went away with him. And a large crowd was following Him, and they were pressing against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now a certain woman, suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and who had suffered many things under many physicians, and who had spent everything at her disposal, and was no better, but rather having become worse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>when she heard about Jesus, she came from behind Him in the crowd and touched His clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For she was saying, "If only I may touch His clothes, I will be healed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she had been healed from her affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, He turned in the crowd [and] said, "Who touched My clothes?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing against You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And He was looking around to see her who had done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While He was still speaking, they came from the synagogue leader, saying, "Your daughter [has] died. Why do you still trouble the Teacher?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But Jesus, immediately when He heard the word being spoken, said to the synagogue leader, "Do not be afraid; only believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He did not permit anyone to follow along with Him except for Peter, James, and John the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He went to the house of the synagogue leader, and observed a commotion, and [people] weeping and wailing, very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when He went in, He said to them, "Why are you making such commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but she is asleep."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they were ridiculing Him. But putting them all out, He took along the father and the mother of the child, and those with Him, and He went in where the child was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And having grasped the hand of the child, He said to her, "Talitha, koumi,"which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And immediately the little girl arose and was walking about, for she was twelve years old. And they were overcome with great amazement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But He ordered them strictly that no one should know this, and said that something should be given her to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
