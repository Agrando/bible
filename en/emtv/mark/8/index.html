And He took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, He broke [them ]and was giving [them] to His disciples, so that they might set [them] before [the people]; and they set them before the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they had a few small fish; and having blessed [them], He said to set them before [the people].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they ate and were filled, and they took up an abundance of fragments, seven hampers [full].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now those having eaten were about four thousand. And He dismissed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And immediately stepping into the boat with His disciples, He came to the region of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Pharisees came out and began to question Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Assuredly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And having dismissed them, and stepping into the boat again, He went away to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they forgot to take bread, and except [for] one loaf, they did not have [any] with themselves in the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then He charged them, saying, "Look out, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, "because we have no bread."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus, knowing about it, said to them, "Why are you reasoning because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Is your heart still hardened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?"They said to Him, "Twelve."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"And when [I broke] the seven for the four thousand, how many hampers full of fragments did you take up?"And they said, "Seven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So He said to them, "How [is it] you do not understand?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and implored Him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having taken the hand of the blind [man], He led him outside the village, and having spit on his eyes, and having laid His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he looked up he said, "I see men like trees, walking."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him to look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then He sent him away to his house, saying, "Neither go into the village, nor tell anyone in the village."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He was questioning His disciples, saying to them, "Who do men pronounce Me to be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So they answered, "John the Baptist; and others [say], Elijah; but others, one of the prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said to them, "But who do you pronounce Me to be?"Peter answered and said to Him, "You are the Christ."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then He warned them that they should tell no one about Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He was speaking this word with boldness. And Peter, taking Him aside, began to rebuke Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when He had turned and saw His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having summoned the crowd together with His disciples, He said to them, "Whoever is willing to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel's, will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Or what shall a man give [as] an equivalent for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For whosoever is ashamed of Me and My words among this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him, whenever He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
