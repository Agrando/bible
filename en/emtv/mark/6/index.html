And many when they heard were astonished, saying, "Where did this Man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him, and such miracles are coming about by His hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?"And they were offended at Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and He could do no miracle there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick [people] and healed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He marveled because of their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He called the twelve to Himself, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them power over unclean spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He commanded them that they should take nothing for the journey except a staff, only-no knapsack, no bread, nor a copper [coin] for their money belts-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but [to go] having put on sandals, and not to put on two tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said to them, "Wherever you may enter into a house, stay there until you go out from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as many as do not receive you nor hear you, as you leave from there, shake off the dust underneath your feet as a testimony against them. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom or for Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they went out, they were preaching that [people] should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they were casting out many demons, and they were anointing with oil many who were sick, and were healing [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And King Herod heard, for His name became well known. And he said, "John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead, and for this reason the miracles are at work in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others said, "He is Elijah."But others said, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when he heard, Herod said, "It is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John would say to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Herodias held a grudge against him and was desiring to kill him, but she was not able;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he was protecting him. And when he heard him, he did many things, but he would hear him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when an opportune day arrived, when Herod for his birthday festivities was putting on a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and when Herodias' daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and his dinner guests, the king said to the girl, "Ask me whatever you may want, and I will give it to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He also swore to her, "Whatever you may ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had gone out, she said to her mother, "What shall I ask?"And she said, "The head of John the Baptist!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Immediately she came in with haste to the king and she requested, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king became exceedingly sorry; yet, because of his oaths and of those who reclined with him, he did not want to refuse her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately the king, having sent an executioner, commanded his head to be brought. And having departed, he beheaded him in the prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when his disciples heard, they came and took away his body and placed it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and they reported to Him all things, both everything they had done and everything they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He said to them, "Come, you yourselves privately, to a deserted place and rest a little."For there were many coming and going, and they were not even finding opportunity to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they went away to a deserted place in the boat privately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the multitudes saw them going, and many recognized Him, and ran together there on foot from all the cities, and preceded them, and they came together to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when He came out, Jesus saw a large crowd, and He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when it grew late, His disciples came to Him and said, "The place is deserted, and already the hour is late.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Dismiss them, so that they may go into the surrounding farms and villages and may buy themselves food; for they have nothing to eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But answering, He said to them, "You give them [something] to eat."And they said to Him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii [worth of] bread and give them [something ]to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see."And when they found out they said, "Five, and two fish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then He gave orders for them all to recline in groups on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they reclined in parties of hundreds and of fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves, and was giving [them] to His disciples, so that they might set them before them; and the two fish He divided to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So they all ate and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and from the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And immediately He compelled His disciples to step into the boat and to go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, until He could dismiss the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And having taken leave of them, He departed to the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now when it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now about the fourth watch of the night He came to them walking on the sea, and He intended to pass by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And seeing Him walking on the sea, they supposed Him to be a spirit, and they cried out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He spoke with them, and said to them, "Have courage! [It is] I AM; do not be afraid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then He went up with them into the boat and the wind ceased. And they were greatly astounded among themselves beyond measure, and were marveling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For they had not understood concerning the loaves, because their heart was hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they came out of the boat, immediately having recognized Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>running about that whole surrounding region, they began to carry about on beds those who were ill to wherever they would hear that He was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And wherever He would enter into villages, or towns, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and they would beg Him at least that they might touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
