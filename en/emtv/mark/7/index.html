And there are many other things which they have received [by tradition], like the washing of cups and pitchers, copper vessels and couches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, "Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but they eat bread with unwashed hands?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And answering He said to them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written: 'This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"For having left the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men-the washing of pitchers and cups, and many other similar things you do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said to them, "Well do you set aside the commandment of God, so that you may keep your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you say, 'If a man says to [his] father or to [his ]mother, "Whatever you might be profited by me is Corban"- (that is, a gift),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>[thus] nullifying the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down. And many similar things you do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And having summoned all the crowd, He said to them, "Hear Me, all [of you] and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing from outside a man, that entering into him, can defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When He had entered a house [away] from the crowd, His disciples were asking Him about the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So He said to them, "Are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything entering a man from outside cannot defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because it does not enter into his heart but into his stomach, and passes into the latrine, [thus] purifying all foods?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He said, "That which comes out of a man, that defiles a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of the heart of men, come forth evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evil things come from within and defile a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From there He arose and He went away into the region of Tyre and Sidon. And having entered into a house, He wanted no one to know it, but He was not able to escape notice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and fell at His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by race, and she was asking Him to cast the demon out from her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And she answered and said to Him, "Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs underneath the table eat from the crumbs of the children."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then He said to her, "Because of this saying, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And going away to her house, she found the demon having gone out, and her daughter having been placed on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Again, coming out from the region of Tyre and Sidon, He went to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the region of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then they brought to Him a deaf man impeded in speech, and they begged Him that He would lay His hand upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when he had taken him aside from the crowd privately, He put His fingers in his ears, and having spit, He touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then looking up into heaven, He sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha,"that is, "Be opened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he was speaking correctly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He ordered them that they should tell no one; but the more He ordered them, the more exceedingly they would proclaim it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
