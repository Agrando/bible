And a large crowd was gathered to Him, so that He got aboard into the boat, and sat on the sea; and all the crowd was upon the land by the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And He was teaching them many [things] by parables, and said to them in His teaching:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it happened, as he sowed, that some [seed] fell alongside the road; and the birds came and devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it had no root it was withered up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And some [seed ]fell into the thorns; and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But other [seed ]fell on good ground, and it was yielding fruit coming up and growing, and it was producing-some thirty[fold], some sixty[,] and some a hundred."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said, "He that has ears to hear, let him hear!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when He was by himself, those around Him together with the twelve asked Him about the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He said to them, "Unto you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things come to be [spoken] in parables,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that 'Seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand; Lest they should turn, and their sins be forgiven them.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He said to them, "Do you not know this parable? How then will you know all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower sows the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are the [seeds] beside the road where the word is sown, and whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which was sown in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these are similarly the [seeds] being sown on stony ground which, whenever they hear the word, immediately they receive it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they have no root in themselves, but are shortlived. Afterward, when trials or persecution arise because of the word, immediately they fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these are the [seeds] being sown in the thorns; they are the [ones] who are hearing the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the anxieties of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things coming in choke out the word, and it becomes fruitless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And these are the [seeds] sown on good ground, such as who hear the word and welcome it, and bear fruit: some thirty [fold], some sixty, and some a hundred."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He said to them, "A lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a measuring basket or under a bed, [is it?] [Is it] not[ brought] so that it may be put on a lampstand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest, nor was it hidden but that it might come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then He said to them, "Watch what you hear. By what measure you measure, it will be measured out to you; and [more] will be added to you who hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever has, [more] will be given to him; and he who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He said, "Thus is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast the seed on the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and should grow, he himself does not know how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth produces fruit of itself: first a shoot, then a head of grain, then full wheat in the head of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But whenever the fruit permits, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then He said, "To what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or by what sort of parable shall we illustrate it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a mustard seed, which whenever it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but whenever it is sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all the garden vegetables, and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven are able to nest under its shade."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And by many such parables He would speak the word to them, just as they were able to hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And apart from a parable He did not speak to them, however, privately to His disciples, he would explain all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And leaving the crowd, they took Him along as He was in the boat. And other little boats were also with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there was a severe windstorm, and the waves dashed up into the boat, so that it was already filling up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But He was in the stern, sleeping upon the cushion. And they awakened Him and said to Him, "Teacher! Does it not matter to You that we are perishing?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having awakened He rebuked the wind, and He said to the sea, "Peace, be still."And the wind abated and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But He said to them, "Why are you so fearful? How [is it that] you do not have faith?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared exceedingly, and were saying to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
