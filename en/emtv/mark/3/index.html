And a man was there who had a withered hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they were observing Him, whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He said to the [one] who had the withered hand, "Step forward."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?"But they kept silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And looking around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the Pharisees went out with the Herodians and immediately conspired against Him, how they might destroy Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a large multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and from Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan, and those around Tyre and Sidon, a large multitude, when they heard everything He was doing, came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the crowd, lest they should crush Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For He had healed many, so that all who had afflictions were crowding upon Him, so that they might touch Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and would cry out, saying, "You are the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He would warn them very much that they should not make Him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He went up on the mountain and summoned those whom He wanted, and they came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He appointed twelve, so that they might be with Him, and so that He might send them out to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He gave Simon the name Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, He gave them the names Boanerges, which is, "Sons of Thunder";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they came into a house.
