See how many things they testify against You!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus no longer answered anything, so that Pilate marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now at the feast he would release one prisoner to them, whomever they would request.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was one called Barabbas, having been bound with his fellow rebels, who had committed murder in the rebellion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the crowd cried out and began to request [that] just as always he would do [this] for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you desire that I release to you the King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered Him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Pilate answered and said to them again, "What then do you desire [that] I should do [with Him ]whom you call King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again they cried, "Crucify Him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil did He do?"But they cried out all the more, "Crucify Him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered up Jesus, after he had Him flogged, so that He might be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the soldiers led Him away into the courtyard, which is the Praetorium, and assembled the whole garrison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, and they put it around His head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and they began to salute Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they were striking His head with a reed and were spitting on Him; and bowing the knee, they [mockingly ]worshipped Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple, and dressed Him in His own clothing. And led Him out so that they might crucify Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they pressed into service a certain [man] [that was] passing by [named] Simon, a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming from the country, that he might carry His cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they brought Him to the place [called ]Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having crucified Him, they divided His clothes by casting lots over them,[ to determine] who would take what.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there was the inscription of His charge having been inscribed: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And together with Him they crucified two bandits, one on His right side and the one on His left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with the transgressors."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads and saying, "Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>save Yourself, and come down from the cross!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking [Him] to each other with the scribes said, "He saved others; Himself He is not able to save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe Him."Even those who were crucified with Him were reviling Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now when the sixth hour had come, darkness came upon the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lima sabachthani?"which is translated, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Some of those standing by when they heard, said, "Look, He is calling Elijah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And one, running and having filled a sponge [with] vinegar, and having put it around a reed, was giving a drink to Him, saying, "Leave Him alone; let us see if Elijah is coming to take Him down."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus, uttering a loud cry, expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now when the centurion who stood across from Him saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, "Truly this Man was the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>who also would follow Him and would minister to Him when He was in Galilee; and many other women who had come up together with Him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And now evening having come, since it was Preparation Day, which is the day before the Sabbath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, he went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Pilate wondered if He was already dead; and having summoned the centurion, he questioned him if He had been dead long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And having bought linen cloth, and having taken Him down, he wrapped Him in the linen cloth and set Him down in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone upon the door of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses were observing where He was placed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
