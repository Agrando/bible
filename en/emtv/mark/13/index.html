By no means shall one stone be left upon another, which shall in any way escape destruction."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus, answering them, began to say: "Take heed lest anyone deceive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For many will come in My name, saying, 'I AM,' and they will deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But whenever you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be disturbed; for these things must occur, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation will be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and disturbances. These [are] the beginnings of birth pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But take heed to yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be flogged in the synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But whenever they lead you forth to deliver you over, do not worry beforehand [as to ]what you will say, nor rack your brains. But whatever is given you in that hour, speak this; for it is not you who is speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and will cause them to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you will be hated by all on account of My name. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"So whenever you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where he must not"-he who reads, let him understand-"then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And let him on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let him who is in the field not return to the things behind[, ]to take his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And pray that your flight does not take place in winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For in those days will be tribulation, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of creation which God created until now, and never again shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And unless the Lord had[ ]cut short the days, no flesh would be saved; but on account of the elect, whom He chose, He cut short the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'Look, there He is!' do not believe [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For false christs and false prophets will arise, and they will give signs and wonders in order to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But you take heed! See, I have foretold to you all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its radiance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the stars of heaven shall be falling out, and the powers in the heavens shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then He will send His angels, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the extremity of earth to the extremity of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So also you, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near-at the doors!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Assuredly I say to you, that by no means will this generation have passed away until all these things have taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"But concerning that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Take heed, stay awake and pray; for you do not know when the time is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>It is like a man going away on a journey, having left his house and having given authority to his servants, and to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper that he should watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming-at evening, or at midnight, or at dawn, or early in the morning-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>lest having come suddenly, he should find you sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the things I say to you, I say to all: watch!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
