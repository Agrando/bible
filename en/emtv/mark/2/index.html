And He was speaking the word to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they came to Him, bringing a paralytic being carried by four [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And not being able to get near Him because of the crowd, they removed the tiles from the roof where He was, and having dug through they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus, seeing their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Child, your sins have been forgiven you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And immediately, when Jesus recognized in His spirit that they were reasoning thus among themselves, He said to them, "Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins have been forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise, take up your bed and walk'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins"-He said to the paralytic,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I say to you, arise, and take up your bed, and go to your house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And immediately he arose, and taking his bed, he went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw [anything] like this!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then He went out again alongside the sea; and all the crowd was coming to Him, and He was teaching them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And passing by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, "Follow Me."And arising, he followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now it came about, as He was dining in Levi's house, that many tax collectors and sinners were dining together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the scribes and Pharisees, seeing Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, said to His disciples, "Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus heard it, He said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill. I did not come to call [the ]righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then they came and said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No one sews a patch of a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; or else [it] takes away its completeness, the new [piece] from the old [garment], and the tear becomes worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine spills out, and the wineskins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it came about as He was going through the grainfields on the Sabbath, that His disciples began to make [their] way picking the heads of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But He said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need, and became hungry, he and those with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How he entered into the house of God at the time Abiathar [was] high priest, and ate the showbread, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave to those who were with him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And He said to them, "The Sabbath came into being for the sake of man, and not man for the sake of the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So then the Son of Man is Lord, even of the Sabbath."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
