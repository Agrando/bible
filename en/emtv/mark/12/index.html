And he leased it to farmers, and went on a journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And at [harvest] time he sent a servant to the farmers, in order that he might receive [his part] from the fruit of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they took him and beat [him] and sent [him] away empty-[handed].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he sent them another servant, and that one they wounded in the head with stones, and they sent him away shamefully treated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And again he sent another, and that one they killed, and [so with ]many others, beating some and killing others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he even sent him to them last, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"But those farmers said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And taking him they killed [him], and cast [him] out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and will destroy the farmers, and give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have you not even read this Scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This was the LORD's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they sought to lay hold of Him, but they feared the crowd, for they knew that He had spoken the parable against them. And leaving Him, they went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, in order that they might catch Him in [His ]discourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they came and said to Him, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and it does not make a difference to you about anyone; for You do not look on the face of men, but you teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Should we give, or should we not give?"But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius, that I may see it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they brought [one]. And He said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"And they said to Him, "Caesar's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."And they marveled at Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then some Sadducees came to Him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked Him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies and leaves behind a wife and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[Now] there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and he died, and left no offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the second took her, and died; nor did he leave any offspring. And the third likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[Therefore], in the resurrection, when they shall arise, whose wife of them will she be? For all seven had her [as] wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus answered and said to them, "Is this not the reason you are mistaken, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whenever they rise from among the dead, neither do they marry nor are they given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, in connection with [the burning] bush [passage], how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is not the God of [the ]dead, but the God of [the] living. Therefore you are greatly mistaken."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then one of the scribes came, after he heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, "Which is the first commandment of all?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered him, "The first of all the commandments is: 'Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God is one LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>' And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So the scribe said to Him, "Well [said], Teacher, in truth You said that He is one, and there is no other besides Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And to love Him with the whole heart, and with the whole understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now when Jesus saw that he answered intelligently, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God."And no one dared any longer to question Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus answered and said, as [He was] teaching in the temple, "How say the scribes that the Christ is the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: 'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Therefore David himself calls Him 'Lord'; how then is He his Son?"And the large crowd was hearing Him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then He said to them in His teaching, "Take heed of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and [like] greetings in the marketplaces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first couches at the suppers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense pray at length. These will receive more abundant judgment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and was observing how the crowd was putting money into the treasury. And many rich [people] were putting in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then one poor widow came and put in two lepta, which equals a quadrans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And having summoned His disciples, He said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting into the treasury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For they all put in out of their excess, but this woman, out of her destitution, put in everything she had, her whole livelihood."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
