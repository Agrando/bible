You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has arisen! He is not here! See the place where they put Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, say to His disciples, and Peter, that He is going before you into Galilee; there you shall see Him, just as He said to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And going out, they fled from the tomb, but trembling and amazement held them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now having arisen early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and reported to those who had been with Him, as they were grieving and weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And those, when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, [they ]disbelieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were going into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And those returned and reported it to the rest; but neither did they believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterwards He appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw Him after He had been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that does not believe shall be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these signs shall accompany those who have believed: In My name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they shall pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means hurt them; they shall lay hands on [the] sick, and they shall be well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with [them] and confirming the word through the accompanying signs.
