When you have untied him, bring [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord has need of him,' and immediately he will send it here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they departed, and found the colt tied up by the door outside in the street, and they untied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But some of those standing there said to them, "What are you doing, loosing the colt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they told them just as Jesus had commanded. And they gave them permission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then they led the colt to Jesus, and placed their clothes on him, and He sat on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And many spread their garments on the road, and others were cutting down branches from the trees and were spreading [them] on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those going before, and those that were[ ]following were crying out, saying: "Hosanna! 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple. And having looked around at all things, the hour already being late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the next day, after they had come out from Bethany, He was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And seeing from a distance a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. And having come to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And answering, Jesus said to it, "May no one eat fruit from you ever again."And His disciples were listening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came to Jerusalem. And when Jesus entered into the temple, He began to throw out those selling and buying in the temple, and He overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those selling the doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He would not permit that anyone should carry a vessel through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He was teaching, saying to them, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a 'den of thieves!' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the scribes and chief priests heard it and they sought how they might destroy Him; for they were afraid of Him, because all the people were astonished at His teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when it became evening, He was going forth outside of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now in the morning while passing by, they saw the fig tree dried up from [its] roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter, remembering, said to Him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has dried up!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Jesus answered and said to them, "Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For assuredly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that the things which he says are coming to pass, whatever he says shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this reason I say to you, all things whatsoever you ask for in prayer, believe that you [will] receive [them], and they will be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive [them], that your Father in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking about in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said to Him, "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Jesus answered and said to them, "I also will ask you one thing, and you answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The baptism of John-was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they were debating among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"But should we say, 'From men' "-they feared the people, for all had counted John to have been a prophet indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And answering they said to Jesus, "We do not know."And Jesus answered and said to them, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
