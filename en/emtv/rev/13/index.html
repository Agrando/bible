And I saw a Beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads blasphemous names.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the Beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And one of his heads [was ]as if it had been slain to death, and his wound of death was healed. And the whole world marveled after the Beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they worshipped the dragon who gave authority to the Beast; and they worshipped the Beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a mouth was given to him speaking great things and blasphemy, and authority was given to him to make war for forty-two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His dwelling, and those who dwell in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, people, language, and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all those who dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose name is not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If anyone has an ear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If anyone has captivity, he goes away; if anyone [is] with [the] sword, he must be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he exercises all the authority of the first beast before him, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it, to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he works great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth before men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he deceives my own [people] who dwell on the earth by the signs which were given to him to do before the Beast, saying to those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound-and came to life! -from the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it was granted to him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, that they should receive marks on their right hand, or on their foreheads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and that no one may buy or sell except he that has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is [the] number of man-his number is 666.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
