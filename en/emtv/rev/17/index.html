And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast being filled with names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup being filled with abominations and the filthiness of the fornication of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And on her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the angel said to me, "Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the Beast carrying her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Beast which you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend out of the bottomless pit and go to perdition. And those who dwell on the earth shall marvel, whose name is not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the Beast that was, and is not, and shall be present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And there are seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And whenever he comes, he must abide [for] a short time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Beast which was, and is not, is also an eighth, and is of the seven, and is going to perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings who not yet have received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings for one hour with the Beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These have one purpose, and they will give their power and authority to the Beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, and elect, and faithful."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the ten horns which you saw, and the Beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her up with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the Beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the woman whom you saw is that great city which has royal rule over the kings of the earth."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
