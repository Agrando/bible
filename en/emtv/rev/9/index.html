And the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit was given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a burning furnace. And the sun was darkened, and the air, from the smoke of the shaft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth. And power was given to them, as scorpions of the earth have power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They were told not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any plant, nor any tree, but [only] those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they were not given authority to kill them, but that they should torment them for five months. And their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in those days men shall seek death, and shall by no means find it; they shall be longing to die, yet death shall elude them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the appearances of the locusts [was] similar to horses having been prepared for battle, and on their heads [were] like crowns of gold, and their faces [were] like the faces of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots with many horses rushing into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they had tails like scorpions, and stings. And in their tails they have power to harm men five months,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>having as a king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One woe is past. Behold, yet two woes are coming after these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the sixth angel sounded [his] trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels having been bound at the great river Euphrates."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill a third of mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the number of the troops of the horsemen was a hundred million; I heard the number of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who rode on them, having breastplates of fire, hyacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses [were] like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed-from the fire and the smoke and the brimstone proceeding out of their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent from the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and of wood, which neither are able to see nor to hear nor to walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their drugs, nor of their fornication or their thefts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
