And you tested those who say that they are apostles and they are not, and you found them [to be ]liars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and you have endurance and you have born patiently on account of My name, and you did not become weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you quickly and I will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of My God."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, 'These things says the First and the Last, who became dead, and came to life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"I know your works, and your tribulation, and your poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but [are] a synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear none of those things which you are about to suffer. Behold indeed, the devil is about to cast [some] of you into prison, so that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall in no way be harmed by the second death."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, 'These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"I know your works, and where you live, where Satan's throne is. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny My faith in the days in which Antipas was My faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan is dwelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you, because you have there [some] who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, both to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, [which ]likewise[ I hate.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent therefore! Or else I will come to you quickly, and make war against them with the sword of My mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to him some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except he who receives it."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, 'These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"I know your works, and love, and faith and service, and your endurance; and your last works [are] greater than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have [this] against you, that you tolerate your wife Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My servants to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gave her time so that she might repent, and she does not wish to repent of her fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I am casting her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, if they do not repent of her works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will kill her children by death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I will put on you no other burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Only hold fast what you have till I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>'And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; they shall be smashed to pieces like clay vessels'-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>as I also have received from My Father; and I will give him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."'</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
