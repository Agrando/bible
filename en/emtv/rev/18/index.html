In her cup which she mixed, mix for her a double [portion.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In as many things as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, in the same measure give to her torment and sorrow; because she says in her heart, 'I sit as queen, and am not a widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"On account of this her plagues will come in one day-death, sorrow, and famine. And she shall be burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who has judged her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"The kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her shall weep and mourn over her, when they see the smoke of her burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>standing from afar on account of the fear of her torment, saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! Because in one hour your judgment came.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of citron wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cinnamon and incense, perfume and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The fruit that your soul longed for has gone from you, and all the sumptuous things and the gaudy things have perished from you, and you shall by no means find them no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, shall stand at afar on account of the fear of her torment, both weeping and sorrowing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city, she who was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and having been gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because in one hour such great wealth was laid waste.' And every captain, and all those sailing along the coast, and sailors, and as many as work on the sea, stood from afar</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and were crying out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, 'Who is like this great city?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and sorrowing, and saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city, by which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! Because in one hour she was laid waste.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence Babylon the great city shall be cast down, and shall by no means be found anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The sound of harpists, and musicians, and of flutists, and of trumpeters shall by no means be heard in you anymore. And no craftsman of any craft shall by no means be found in you anymore, and the sound of a mill shall by no means be heard in you anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the light of a lamp shall by no means shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and of a bride shall by no means be heard in you anymore. Your merchants were the magnates of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all those who had been slain on the earth."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
