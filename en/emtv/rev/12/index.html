And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that whenever she might give birth, he might devour her Child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she gave birth to a Son, a male who would shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her Child was caught up to God and to His throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place having been prepared by God, so that they may nourish her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there came to be war in heaven: Michael and his angels, waging war with the dragon; and the dragon made war, and his angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he did not prevail, nor was a place found for him [any] longer in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because the accuser of our brothers, the [one] who accused them before our God day and night, has been thrown [out of heaven].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and to the sea! Because the devil was thrown down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male [Child].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly into the desert to her place, so that she might be nourished there [for] a time and times and half a time, from [the] face of the serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a river after the woman, so that he might cause her to be carried off by the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon had cast out of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went off to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
