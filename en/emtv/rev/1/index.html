And He made it known by sending it through His angel to His servant John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>who testified to the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as many things as He saw, both the things that are and those that must happen after these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who keep the things having been written in it; for the time is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>John, to the seven churches [which are] in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven-fold Spirit who is before His throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and who washed us from our sins in His own blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and He made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, and those who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"I am the Alpha and the Omega,"says the Lord God, "He who is and He who was and He who is to come, The Almighty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I, John, your brother and partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Christ Jesus, came to be on the island that is called Patmos on account of the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I was in [the ]Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard a loud voice like a trumpet behind me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>saying, "That which you see, write in a book and send to the seven churches: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there I turned to see the voice which was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and in the midst of the seven lampstands [stood One] like [the] Son of Man, having been clothed in a [robe] reaching to [His] feet and having been girded across [His] chest with a golden belt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And His head and His hair were white, and like white wool, like snow, and His eyes [were ]like a flame of fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was as the sun shining in its strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as [if] dead. But He put His right hand on me, saying, "Do not fear; I am the First and the Last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am He who lives, and became dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Death and of Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Write therefore the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
