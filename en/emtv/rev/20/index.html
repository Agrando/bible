[But] after these things he must be released for a short time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them, and the souls of those who had been beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God, and those who had not worshipped the Beast or his image, and they did not receive the mark on their forehead or on their hand. And they came to life and reigned with Christ [for] the thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him for a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war, whose number is like the sand of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone where also the Beast and the False Prophet [are]. And they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw a great white throne and He who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled. And no place was found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened the books. And another book was opened, which is [the Book] of Life. And the dead were judged by the things having been written in the books, according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if anyone was not found having been written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the lake of fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
