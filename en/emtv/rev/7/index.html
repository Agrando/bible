And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been granted to harm the earth and the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>saying, "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I heard the number of those having been sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand having been sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand, having been sealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no man could number, out of every nation, and [from] tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, having been clothed in long white robes, with palm branches in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation [belongs] to our God, to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living beings, and they fell down on their faces before His throne and they worshipped God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying: "Amen!
