"But do not fear their threats, nor be troubled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be prepared with a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>having a good conscience, so that in what they speak against you as evildoers, those reviling your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better to suffer for doing good, if it is the will of God, than [for] doing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Christ also suffered once to atone for sins, [the] just for [the] unjust, that He might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who formerly disobeyed, when the longsuffering of God was waiting in the days of Noah, when the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>which [as] an antitype, baptism now also saves us-(not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but an appeal to God [for] a good conscience), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who having gone into heaven, is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
