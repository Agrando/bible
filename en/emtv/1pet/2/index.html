Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Servants, subject yourselves to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the crooked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For this is admirable, if because of conscience toward God someone endures pain, suffering unjustly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what glory [is it,] if when you sin and are beaten, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer [for it,] you endure, this is admirable before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving behind an example for you, that you should follow in His footsteps,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who, being verbally abused, did not return verbal insults, when [He] suffered, [He] did not threaten, but committed [Himself] to Him who judges righteously;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, in order that having died to sins, we might live unto righteousness-by whose stripes you were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were like sheep going astray, but you have turned back now to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
