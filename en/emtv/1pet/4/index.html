If anyone serves, [let him serve] as from strength, as God supplies, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Beloved, do not be surprised by the fiery trial among you, taking place to test you, as though some strange thing [was] happening to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but inasmuch as you partake in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, in order that also at the unveiling of His glory, you may rejoice with great happiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you are reviled in the name of Christ, blessed are you, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On the one hand He is blasphemed, but on the other He is glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For let not anyone of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler in other people's affairs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but if anyone [suffers] as a Christian, let him not be put to shame, but let him glorify God in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the time [has come] for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if [it begins] with us first, what will be the end of those who are disobedient to the gospel of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And "If the righteous [one] is scarcely saved, where will the godless and the sinner appear?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
