Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>just as You have given Him authority over all flesh, so that He will give eternal life to all You have given Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have glorified You on the earth. I have finished the work which You have given Me to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now, O Father, glorify Me alongside Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have manifested Your name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You have given them to Me, and they have kept Your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now they have known that all things which You have given Me are from You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because I have given to them the words which You have given Me; and they have received [them], and they knew truly that I came forth from You; and they have believed that You sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I pray for them. I do not pray for the world but for [those] whom You have given Me, for they are Yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all Mine are Yours, and Yours [are] Mine, and I have been glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I am no longer in the world, yet these are in the world, and I am coming to You. Holy Father, keep them in Your name which You have given to Me, that they may be one just as We [are].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When I was with them in the world, I kept them in Your name. [Those] whom You have given to Me I guarded; and not one of them is lost except the son of perdition, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But now I am coming to You, and these things I speak in the world, so that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I do not ask that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil [one].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sanctify them by Your truth; Your word is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Just as You sent Me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also may be sanctified by [the] truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"I am not praying for these alone, but also for those who believe in Me through their word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that they all may be one, just as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, so that the world may believe that You sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the glory which You have given to Me, I have given to them, so that they may be one just as We are one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I in them, and You in Me; so that they may be perfected in unity, and so that the world may know that You have sent Me, and You loved them just as You loved Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Father, I desire that those also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, so that they may behold My glory which You gave to Me; because You loved Me before the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>O righteous Father! Indeed the world did not know You, yet I knew You; and these knew that You sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I made known to them Your name, and I will make it known, so that the love [with] which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
