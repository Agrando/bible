And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, [son ]of Simon, who was about to betray Him, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to pilfer the things which were placed in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus said, "Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now a large crowd from the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the chief priests took counsel, that they might also kill Lazarus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because on account of him many of the Jews were going [away], and were believing in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the next day a large crowd which was coming to the feast, having heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and they were crying out, "Hosanna! 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!' The King of Israel!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, he sat on it; as it is written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, sitting on the colt of a donkey."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him, and they did these things to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the crowd which was with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, was testifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On account of this the crowd also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "You see that you are not doing any good. Look, the world has gone after Him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there were some Greeks among those coming up, so that they might worship at the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Most assuredly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if anyone serve Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant shall be also. If anyone serve Me, him My Father will honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Now My soul has been troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify Your name."Then a voice came out of heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify [it] again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore the crowd which was standing and heard were saying that it had thundered. Others were saying, "An angel has spoken to Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, "This voice did not come for My sake, but for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world shall be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [peoples] to Myself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>This He said, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The crowd answered Him, "We heard from the law that the Christ abides forever; and so how do You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus said to them, "[For] yet a little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light."These things Jesus spoke, and departing, He was hidden from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But even though He had done so many signs in their presence, they did not believe in Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, lest they should see with their eyes, lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke about Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless even from among the rulers many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be excommunicated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in Me, believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come as a light into the world, so that whoever believes in Me may not abide in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He that rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him-the word which I spoke, that [word] will judge him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken on My own [authority]; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that His command is eternal life. Therefore, whatever I speak, as the Father has said to Me, thus I speak."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
