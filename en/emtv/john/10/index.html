If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But a hired hand, he who is not the shepherd, one who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches the sheep and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and is not concerned about the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd; and I know My [own], and I am known by My own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Just as the Father knows Me, I also know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will hear My voice; and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it [up ]again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it [up ]again. This command I have received from My Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore there was a division again among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of them said, "He has a demon and is raving mad. Why do you listen to Him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, "These are not the words of [one] being demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon's Porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Jews encircled Him and said to Him, "How long will You hold us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in My Father's name, these things testify about Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep, just as I said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I give to them eternal life, and they shall never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who has given [them] to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch [them] out of My Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore the Jews took up stones again to stone Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, "Many good works I have shown you from My Father. For which of those works do you stone Me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered Him, saying, "For a good work we do not stone You, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a Man, make Yourself God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, "You are gods"'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If He called those gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you say of Him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I am not doing the works of My Father, do not believe Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but if I am doing [them], even if you do not believe Me, believe the works, so that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they were seeking again to seize Him, but He escaped from their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And He went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He stayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to Him and said, "John indeed performed no sign, but everything which John said about this [Man] was true."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed in Him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
