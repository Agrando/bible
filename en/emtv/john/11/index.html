If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things He said, and after this He said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awaken him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then His disciples said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep he will get well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, Jesus spoke about his death, but they thought that He was speaking about resting in sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I rejoice for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, so that we may die with Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore when He had come, Jesus found that he had already been in the tomb four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And many of the Jews had come to the [women] around Martha and Mary, so that they might console them concerning their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But even now I know that whatever You may ask of God, God will give You."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said to Him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when she had said these things, she went out and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as she heard [that], she arose quickly and came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews who were with her in the house and consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb, so that she may weep there."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, seeing Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He said, "Where have you laid him?"They said to Him, "Lord, come and see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore the Jews were saying, "Look how He loved him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But some of them said, "Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have done [something] to keep this man from dying?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, "Take away the stone."Martha, the sister of the [one] having died, said to Him, "Lord, already there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I knew that You always hear Me, but because of the people standing around I said [this], so that they may believe that You sent Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And having said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the [one] having died came out, bound hands and feet with grave clothes, and his face was wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, "Loose him, and let [him] go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and seeing the things which Jesus had done, believed in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, "What are we doing? For this Man works many signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we leave Him alone in this way, all will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and will take away both our place and nation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, "You don't know anything,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Now this he did not say on his own, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Therefore from that day [on] they took counsel together, that they might kill Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but He went away from there into the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there He stayed with His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, so that they might purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then they were seeking Jesus, and they were speaking with one another, standing in the temple, "What do you think-that He will definitely not come to the feast?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report [it], so that they might seize Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
