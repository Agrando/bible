Therefore the men reclined, in number about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks He distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were reclining; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they were filled, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the leftover fragments, so that nothing may be lost."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore they gathered [them] up, and they filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, "This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and seize Him, that they might make Him king, withdrew to the mountain by Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and having entered into the boat, they were going across the sea to Capernaum. And darkness had already come, and Jesus had not come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sea was agitated by a great blowing wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore having rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But He said to them, "[It is] I AM; do not fear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat arrived at the land to which they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the next day, when the crowd which had remained on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other boat there, except that one in which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when the crowd therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, "Rabbi, when did You come here?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them and said, "Most assuredly I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give to you; for [upon] Him God the Father has set [His] seal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they said to Him, "What should we do, that we may work the works of God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore they said to Him, "What sign will You do then, so that we may see it and believe You? What work do You perform?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then they said to Him, "Lord, give us this bread always."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I told you that you have both seen Me and you do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I have come down from heaven, not that I might do My will, but the will of Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Therefore the Jews were murmuring about Him, because He said, "I am the bread which came down from heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they were saying, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does this [Man] say, 'I have come down from heaven'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, "Do not murmur among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me should draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the prophets, 'And they shall all be taught of God.' Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Most assuredly I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Therefore the Jews were contending with one another, saying, "How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For My flesh truly is food, and My blood truly is drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna, and died. He that eats this bread shall live forever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a hard saying; who can hear it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, He said to them, "Does this offend you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>What then if you should see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the Spirit who makes alive; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you who do not believe."For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe, and who was the one who would betray Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And He said, "Because of this I have said to you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by My Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>From this [time] many of His disciples turned back and no longer would walk with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then Jesus said to the twelve, "Do you also want to go away?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He answered them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Now He was speaking [about] Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon, for he was intending to betray Him, though he was one of the twelve.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
