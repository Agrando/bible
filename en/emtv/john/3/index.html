Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless someone is born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not marvel that I said to you, 'You must be born again.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"The wind blows where it wills, and you hear its sound, but you do not know from where it comes and where it goes. So is everyone who has been born of the Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said to Him, "How can these things be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to him, "Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Most assuredly I say to you, that which We know, We speak, and that which We have seen, We bear witness to, and you do not receive Our witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And no one has gone up into heaven except He who came down out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that everyone who believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God did not send His Son into the world so that He might condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than the light, because their works were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For everyone that does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works be exposed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his works may be revealed, that they have been done in God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things Jesus, along with His disciples, came into the land of Judea, and there He was staying with them and He was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salem, because there was much water there. And they came and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John was not yet cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then there came to be a dispute between John's disciples and a Jew about purification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came to John and said to him, "Rabbi, He who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testified-behold, this [Man] is baptizing, and all [men] are coming to Him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves bear witness that I said, 'I am not the Christ,' but, 'I have been sent before Him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore my joy has been fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must increase, but I must decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He who comes from above is above all; he who is from the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth. He who comes from heaven is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what He has seen and heard, that He testifies; and no one receives His testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He who receives His testimony has certified that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into His hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who believes in the Son has eternal life; and he who does not believe the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
