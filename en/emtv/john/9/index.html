So he went and washed, and came back seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore the neighbors and those who previously saw him, that he was blind, were saying, "Is not this he who sat and begged?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, "This is he."Others said, "He looks like him."He kept saying, "I am [he]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore they said to him, "How were your eyes opened?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered and said, "A Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, 'Go to the pool of Siloam and wash.' When I had gone and washed, I received [my ]sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they said to him, "Where is He?"He said, "I do not know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought him who was once blind to the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was a Sabbath when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then again the Pharisees were asking him how he received [his] sight. And he said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying, "This Man is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath."Others said, "How can a sinful man do such signs?"And there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They said to the blind [man] again, "What do you say about Him because He opened your eyes?"He said, "He is a prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he was blind and received [his] sight, until they called the parents of him who had received [his] sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they asked them, saying, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And his parents answered them and said, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but how he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age; ask him. He will speak for himself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things[ ]his parents said because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone should confess that He was Christ, he would be excommunicated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On account of this his parents said, "He is of age; ask him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore they called a second time the man who was blind, and said to him, "Give glory to God! We know that this Man is a sinner."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered and said, "Whether He is a sinner or not I do not know. One [thing] I do know: that although I was blind, now I see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they said to him again, "What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them, "I told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you wish to hear [it] again? Do you also want to become His disciples?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[Then] they reviled him and said, "You are His disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God has spoken to Moses; but [as for ]this [Man], we do not know where He is from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered and said to them, "Why, this is a remarkable thing, that you do not know where He is from; yet He opened my eyes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Since eternity past it was unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of [one] having been born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this [Man] were not from God, He could do nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said to him, "You were completely born in sins, and do you teach us?"And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and having found him, He said to him, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered and said, "And who is He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus said to him, "You have both seen Him and it is He who is speaking with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he said, "Lord, I believe!"And he worshipped Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said, "For judgment I came into this world, that those who do not see may see, and those who see might become blind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then [some] of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things, and said to Him, "Are we blind also?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, 'We see.' Therefore your sin remains.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
