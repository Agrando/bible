But these things I did not say to you from the beginning, because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"But now I am going to Him who sent Me, and none of you asks Me, 'Where are You going?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless I speak the truth to you. It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when He comes, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>of sin, because they do not believe in Me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of righteousness, because I am going to My Father and you see Me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>of judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own [authority], but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will announce to you things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify Me, for He will take from what is Mine and He will announce it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things which the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He takes from what is Mine and will announce it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"A little [while] and you will not see Me; and again a little [while] and you will see Me, because I am going to the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then [some] of His disciples said to one another, "What is this that He says to us, 'A little [while] and you will not see Me; and again a little [while] and you will see Me'; and, 'I am going to the Father'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore they said, "What is this that He says, 'A little [while]'? We do not understand what He is saying."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Jesus knew that they were desiring to ask Him, and He said to them, "Are you inquiring with one another that I said, 'A little [while] and you will not see Me; and again a little [while] and you will see Me'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Most assuredly I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; and you will be grieved, but your grief will be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman, whenever she gives birth, has sorrow, because her hour has come; but whenever the child is born, she no longer remembers the anguish, on account of the joy that a human being has been born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore you also now have sorrow; but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy no one will take from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"These things I have spoken to you in figures of speech; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will beseech the Father for you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father and I have come into the world. Again, I am leaving the world and I am going to the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said to Him, "See, now You are speaking plainly, and using no figure of speech!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we are sure that You know all things, and have no need that anyone should question You. By this we believe that You came forth from God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, "Now do you believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Indeed a time is coming, and now has come, that you will be scattered, each to his own, and you will leave Me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation; but have courage, I have overcome the world."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
