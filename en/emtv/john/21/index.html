And when He had spoken this, He said to him, "Follow Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had reclined on His chest at the supper, and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays You?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, "But Lord, what [about] this [man]?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, "If I will that he remain till I come, what is [that] to you? You follow Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore this saying went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, "If I will that he remain till I come, what is [that] to you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would have room for the books which would be written. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
