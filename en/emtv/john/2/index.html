My hour has not yet come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother said to the servants, "Whatever He may say to you, do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were six stone water jars standing there, according to the purification rites of the Jews, each holding two or three measures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to them, "Fill the water jars with water."And they filled them up to the top.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He said to them, "Draw out now, and carry [some] to the head steward."And they carried [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when the head steward tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the head steward called the bridegroom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said to him, "Every man first sets out the good wine, and when they have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this He went down to Capernaum, He, His mother, His brothers, and His disciples; and there they remained not many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having made a scourge out of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the coins of the moneychangers, and He overturned the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He said to those selling the doves, "Take these things [away] from here! Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then His disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal for Your house will consume Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore the Jews answered and said to Him, "What sign do You show to us, since You do these things?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered and said to them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the Jews said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But He was speaking about the temple of His body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, when He was raised up from among the dead, His disciples remembered that He spoke this [thing,] and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the feast, many believed on His name, beholding the signs which He was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew all [men],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and had no need that anyone should testify concerning man, for He himself knew what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
