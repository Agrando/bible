Therefore as she was weeping, she stooped down [and] [looked] into the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?"She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And having said these things, she turned back and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?"She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, "Sir, if You carried Him away, tell me where You put Him, and I will take Him away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, "Mary!"She turned and said to Him, "Rabboni!"(which means, Teacher).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene went reporting to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] He had spoken these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore Jesus said to them again, "Peace to you! Just as the Father has sent Me, I also send you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain [the sins] of any, they have been retained."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thomas, one of the twelve, the [one ]called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples therefore said to him, "We have seen the Lord."So he said to them, "Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will by no means believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors having been closed, and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace to you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He said to Thomas, "Bring your finger here, and see My hands; and bring your hand here, and put [it] into My side. Be not unbelieving, but believing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that [by ]believing you may have life in His name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
