And Pilate said to them, "Behold, the Man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, when the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!"Pilate said to them, "You take Him and crucify [Him], for I find no fault in Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore, when Pilate heard this saying, he was [even] more afraid,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where are You from?"But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Pilate said to Him, "Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have authority to crucify You, and I have authority to release You?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered, "You would have no authority at all against Me unless it had been given to you from above. Therefore the one who betrayed Me to you has a greater sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From this [point ]Pilate was seeking to release Him, but the Jews kept crying out, saying, "If you release this [Man], you are no friend of Caesar's. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore Pilate, having heard this saying, led Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place that is called [The] Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was the Preparation [Day] of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they cried out, "Away [with Him], away [with Him]! Crucify Him!"Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led [Him ]away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And bearing His cross, He went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Pilate wrote a title and he put [it] on the cross. And it was written: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'He said, "I am the King of the Jews."' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top in one piece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it will be,"so that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: "They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots."Therefore the soldiers did these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore Jesus, seeing His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, "Woman, behold your son!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He said to the disciple, "Behold your mother!"And from that hour that disciple took her into his own [care].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus, seeing that all things already had been fulfilled, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, He said, "I thirst!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now a vessel was set full of sour wine; and they, having filled a sponge with sour wine, put it around a hyssop, they held it to His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore when Jesus received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!"And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore the Jews, since it was the Preparation [Day], that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they might be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers came and they broke the legs of the first [man,] and of the other who was crucified with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But having come to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he tells the truth, so that you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, "Not a bone of His shall be broken."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another Scripture says, "They shall look at [Him] whom they pierced."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After these things[,] Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen strips with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews' Preparation Day, because the tomb was near.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
