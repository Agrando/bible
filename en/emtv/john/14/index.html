I go to prepare a place for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and I will receive you unto Myself; so that where I am, there you may be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And where I am going you know, and the way you know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thomas said to Him, "Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now [on] you know Him and you have seen Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philip said to Him, "Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you for so long a time, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He that has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, 'Show us the Father'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words which I speak to you I do not speak on My own [authority]; but the Father who abides in Me does the works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe Me that I [am] in the Father and the Father [is ]in Me, but if not, believe Me for the sake of the works themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Most assuredly I say to you, he that believes in Me, the works which I do he will do also; and greater [works] than these he will do, because I go to My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whatever you may ask in My name, this I will do, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you should ask anything in My name, I will do [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"If you love Me, keep My commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Helper, so that He may abide with you forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Yet a little while and the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you will live also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day you will know that I [am] in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He that has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me shall be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, "Lord, and what has happened that You are about to manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered and said to him, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and we will make [Our] home with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father's who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"These things I have spoken to you while I remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and will remind you [of] all things which I said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have heard that I said to you, 'I am going away and coming [back] to you.' If you loved Me, you would have rejoiced that I said, 'I am going to the Father,' for My Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now I have told you before it happens, so that whenever it may happen, you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will no longer speak many things with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has nothing in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father has charged Me, thus I do. Rise up, let us go from here.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
