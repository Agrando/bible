Therefore Jesus, having become tired from the journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For His disciples had gone away into the city, that they might buy provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the woman of Samaria said to Him, "How is it that You, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?"For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to her, "If you had known the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, 'Give Me a drink,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given to you living water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman said to Him, "Sir, You have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where then do You get that living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are You greater than our father Jacob,[ ]who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered and said to her, "Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but whoever drinks of the water which I shall give him will by no means ever thirst again. But the water which I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman said to Him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered and said, "I have no husband."Jesus said to her, "You have said well, 'I have no husband,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"for you have had five husbands, and [the one] whom you now have is not your husband; in this you have said truly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said to Him, "Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, and you [Jews] say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You worship what you do not know; we [Jews ]worship what we know, because salvation is of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God [is] Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman said to Him, "I know that Messiah is coming"(who is called Christ). "When He comes, He will proclaim to us all things."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to her, "I am [He,] the [One ]speaking to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And at this point His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; however no one said, "What do You seek?"or, "Why are You speaking with her?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman then left her water jar, went her way into the city, and said to the men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Come, see a Man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They went out of the city and were coming to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But in the meantime the disciples urged Him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But He said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore the disciples were saying to one another, "Has anyone brought Him [something] to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say, 'There are still four months and the harvest comes'? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and see the fields, for they are already white for harvest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he who[ ]reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit unto eternal life, that both he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For in this the saying is true: 'One sows and another reaps.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labors."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman testifying, "He told me everything I ever did."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when the Samaritans had come to Him, they were asking Him to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed because of His word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then they were saying to the woman, "No longer because of your speech do we believe, for we ourselves have heard and know that this is truly the Christ, the Savior of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now after the two days He went out from there and went to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Therefore when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all the things which He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Jesus came again to Cana of Galilee where He made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and asked Him that He might come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then Jesus said to him, "Unless you [people] see signs and wonders, you will by no means believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The nobleman said to Him, "Sir, come down before my child dies!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, "Go; your son lives."And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And already as he was going, his servants met him and reported, saying, "Your child lives!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then he inquired from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Therefore the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives."And he himself believed, and his whole household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This again is the second sign Jesus did, after He had come out of Judea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
