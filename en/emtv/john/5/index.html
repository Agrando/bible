And that day was the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore the Jews said to the man who was healed, "It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them, "He that made me whole, He said to me, 'Take up your bed and walk.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they asked him, "Who is the Man who said to you, 'Take up your bed and walk'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had turned aside, while a crowd was in that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After these things Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "See, you have become well. Sin no more, lest something worse may happen to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man went away and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the [One ]who had made him well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And on account of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, and were seeking to kill Him, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus answered them, "My Father has been working until now, and I am working."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because of this the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but also He called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Most assuredly I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father doing; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loves the Son, and shows to Him all things which He Himself does; and greater works than these He will show Him, so that you may marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raises up the dead and gives life, thus also the Son gives life to whom He wills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Father judges no one, but He has given all judgment to the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>so that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Most assuredly I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Most assuredly I say to you, that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those having heard shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is [the] Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear His voice</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and shall come forth-those who have done good, to a resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to a resurrection of condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can of My own self do nothing. Even as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"If I testify of Myself, My testimony is not valid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that the testimony which He testifies concerning Me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I do not receive the testimony from man, but these things I say so that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have a testimony greater than John's; for the works which the Father gave to Me, that I should complete them, these very works which I do, testify of Me, that the Father has sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified about Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But you do not have His word abiding in you, because [Him ]whom He sent, Him you do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You search the Scriptures, because you think [that] in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But you are unwilling to come to Me, so that you may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I do not receive glory from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I have known you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from the only God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you-Moses, in whom you have hoped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you believed Moses, you would have believed Me; for he wrote about Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
