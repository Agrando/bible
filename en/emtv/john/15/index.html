Just as the branch cannot bear fruit on its own, unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, you [are] the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; because apart from Me you can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out like a branch and dries up; and they gather them and throw [them] into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what ever you may desire, and it shall be done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By this My Father is glorified, that you may bear much fruit; and you will become My disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Just as the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and I abide in His love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may abide in you, and that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love has no one than this, that one should lay down his life on behalf of his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are My friends if you do what I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No longer do I call you servants, because a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, because all things which I heard from My Father I have made known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, so that whatever you may ask the Father in My name He may give to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things I command you, that you may love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word which I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse concerning their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who hates Me hates My Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done the works among them which no one else has done, they would have no sin; but now they have both seen and they have hated both Me and My Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But [this was] so that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their law, 'They hated Me without cause.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify about Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you also will testify, because you have been with Me from the beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
