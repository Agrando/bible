If You do these things, show Yourself to the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For not even His brothers believed in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You go up to this feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because My time has not yet been fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when His brothers had gone up, then also He Himself went up to the feast, not openly, but as [it were] in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Jews were seeking Him at the feast, and said, "Where is He?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the crowds concerning Him. Some on the one hand were saying, "He is a good [Man]"; [while ]others were saying, "No, on the contrary, He deceives the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews were marveling, saying, "How is this Man learned, since He has not been educated?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore Jesus answered them and said, "My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone desires to do His will, he will know about the doctrine, whether it is from God, or whether I am speaking on My own authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who speaks from himself is seeking his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Has not Moses given you the law, yet none of you keeps the law? Why are you seeking to kill Me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The crowd answered and said, "You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, "I did one work, and [you] all marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because of this Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on [the] Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man receives circumcision on [the] Sabbath, so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on [the] Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore some of people of Jerusalem were saying, "Is this not He whom they are seeking to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And look! He is speaking publicly, and they say nothing to Him. Can it be that the rulers know indeed that this is truly the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore Jesus cried out, as He was teaching in the temple, saying, "You both know Me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come on my own, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know Him, for I am from Him, and He sent Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore they were seeking to arrest Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many of the crowd believed in Him, and were saying, "When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this [Man] did?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent attendants so that they might arrest Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus said, "Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go to Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You will seek Me and you will not find [Me], and where I am you cannot come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore the Jews said among themselves, "Where does this [man] intend to go that we will not find Him? Does He intend to go into the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What is this thing which He said, 'You will seek Me and you will not find [Me], and where I am you cannot come'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now on the last day, the great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He that believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>(But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him were about to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet [given], because Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore many from the crowd, when they heard this saying, said, "Truly this is the Prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, "This is the Christ."Others said, "But the Christ is not coming out of Galilee, [is He]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes from the seed of David and from the village of Bethlehem, where David was?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Therefore a division occurred among the crowd because of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now some of them wished to arrest Him, but no one laid a hand on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the attendants came to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, "Why did you not bring Him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The attendants answered them, "No man ever spoke like this Man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the Pharisees answered them, "Have you also been deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the rulers or the Pharisees believed in Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this crowd which does not know the law is accursed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus (he who came to Him by night, being one of them) said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Does our law judge a man before it hears from him first, and knows what he is doing?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search and see, because no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And everyone went to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
