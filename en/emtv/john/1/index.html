"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And out of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came to be through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, He who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared [Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, "Who are you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Messiah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?"He said, "I am not.""Are you the Prophet?"And he answered, "No."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then they said to him, "Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said: "I am 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Make straight the way of the LORD,"' just as Isaiah the prophet said."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now those who had been sent were from the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him, saying, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, "I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is the [One ]who comes after me, who has come to be before me, of whom I am not worthy that I should loose the strap of His sandal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things happened in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is the [One] about whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who ranks before me, because He was before me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"I did not know Him; but that He should be made manifest to Israel, therefore I came baptizing with water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John testified, saying, "I have beheld the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove, and He remained upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And looking at Jesus as He [was] walking, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus turned and observed them following, and said to them, "What are you seeking?"They said to Him, "Rabbi"(which is translated, Teacher), "where are You staying?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He said to them, "Come and see."They came and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah"(which is translated, the Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he led him to Jesus. Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, "You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas"(which is translated, A Stone).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>On the next day He wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, "Follow Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found the [One] about whom Moses wrote in the Law, and the Prophets-Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"Philip said to him, "Come and see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said about him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael said to Him, "From where do You know me?"Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered and said to Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And He said to him, "Most assuredly I say to you, from now on you shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
