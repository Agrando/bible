Therefore what do You say?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this they said, testing Him, that they might have an accusation against Him. But Jesus, stooping down, began to write on the ground with His finger, not taking notice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And while they were continuing questioning Him, rising up, He said unto them, "He who is without sin among you, let him [be the ]first to cast a stone at her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who heard [it] began to go out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman being in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And standing up and seeing no one but the woman, Jesus said to her, "Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She said, "No one, Lord."And Jesus said to her, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, "I am the light of the world. He that follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore the Pharisees said to Him, "You testify about Yourself; Your testimony is not valid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said to them, "Even if I should testify about Myself, My testimony is valid, because I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; because I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is valid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am the [One] testifying about Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies about Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they said to Him, "Where is Your Father?"Jesus answered, "You know neither Me nor My Father. If you knew Me, you would also know My Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, while teaching in the temple; and no one seized Him, for His time had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus said to them again, "I am going away, and you will seek Me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the Jews said, "[Surely ]He will not kill Himself, [will He,] since He says, 'Where I am going you cannot come'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He said to them, "You are from below; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then they said to Him, "Who are You?"And Jesus said to them, "Just what I have been saying to you [from] the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but He who sent Me is true; and the[ ]things which I heard from Him, these things I say to the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They did not know that He was speaking to them [about] the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore Jesus said to them, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM, and from Myself I do nothing; but just as My Father taught Me, these things I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone, because I always do the things pleasing to Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>While He spoke these words, many believed in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed Him, "If you abide in My word, truly you are My disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered Him, "We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How [can] you say, 'You will become free'?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, "Most assuredly I say to you, that everyone that practices sin is a slave of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And a slave does not remain in the house forever, but a son remains forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore if the Son sets you free, you will be truly free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"I know that you are Abraham's descendants, but you seek to kill Me, because My word finds no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak what I have seen with My Father, and you do what you have seen with your father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said to Him, "Abraham is our father."Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now you seek to kill Me, a Man who has spoken to you the truth which I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You do the works of your father."Then they said to Him, "We were not born of fornication; we have one Father-God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would have loved Me, for I came forth and have come from God; nor have I come from Myself, but He sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do you not understand what I say? Because you are unable to hear My word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father you desire to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks from his own [resources], for he is a liar, and the father of lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convicts Me of sin? And if I tell the truth, why do you not believe Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He who is of God hears God's words; therefore you do not hear [them], because you are not of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the Jews answered and said to Him, "Do we not say well that You are a Samaritan, and You have a demon?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, "I do not have a demon; but I honor My Father, and you dishonor Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I do not seek My own glory; there is One who seeks it and who judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Most assuredly I say to you, if anyone keeps My word he shall by no means experience death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then the Jews said to Him, "Now we know that You have a demon! Abraham and the prophets died, and You say, 'If anyone keeps My word he shall by no means taste death.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>"Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? Also the prophets died. Whom do You make Yourself [out to be]?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, "If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing. It is My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And yet you have not known Him, but I know Him. And if I would say that I do not know Him, I would be like you, a liar; but I do know Him, and I keep His word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he should see My day, and he saw it and he was glad."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then the Jews said to Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Therefore they picked up stones to throw at Him; but Jesus hid Himself and went out of the temple, having gone through their midst, and so passed by.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
