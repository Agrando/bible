And Peter said to Him, "Lord, do You wash my feet?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered and said to him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but you shall know after this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said to Him, "You shall never wash my feet!"Jesus answered him, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to him, "He that is bathed need only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, "You are not all clean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So when He had washed their feet, and had taken His garments, He reclined again, and said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say correctly, for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore if I, your Lord and your Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I gave you an example, that just as I did to you, you also should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Most assuredly I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, nor a messenger greater than he who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I do not speak concerning all of you. I know [those] whom I chose; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, 'He who eats bread with Me has lifted up his heel against Me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From now [on] I tell you before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe that I AM.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Most assuredly I say to you, he who receives whomever I send receives Me; and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in His spirit, and testified and said, "Most assuredly I say to you, one of you will betray Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore the disciples were looking at one another, perplexed about whom He was speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, [the one ]whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to inquire who it might be about whom He was speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then, leaning back thus on Jesus' chest, he said to Him, "Lord, who is it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, "It is the [one] to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it."And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the piece of bread, then Satan entered him. Therefore Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But no one reclining at the table knew for what purpose He said [this] to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some were thinking, since Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy [the ]things of which we need for the feast,"or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore having received the piece of bread, he then went out immediately. And it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When he had gone out, Jesus said, "Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God has been glorified in Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, 'Where I am going, you cannot come,' so now I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, where are You going?"Jesus answered him, "Where I am going you cannot follow Me now, but later you will follow Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said to Him, "Lord, why can I not follow You now? I will lay down my life for You."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him, "Will you lay down your life for Me? Most assuredly I say to you, the rooster shall by no means crow till you deny Me three times.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
