For since the fathers died, all things continue as from the beginning of creation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this they willingly forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and [the] earth, consisting out of water and through water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>by which the world at that time perished, being flooded by water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but the present heavens and earth, having been stored up by His word, are being reserved for fire until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But in this let it not escape your notice, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord does not delay concerning His promise, as some reckon slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a rushing noise, and the elements, burning with heat, shall be dissolved, both the earth and the works that are in it shall be burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, [seeing that] all these things shall be dissolved, what sort of [people] ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens, being set of fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements, burning with heat, shall melt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But according to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot or blemish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation-just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as also in all his letters, speaking in them about these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on guard, lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being carried away by the error of the wicked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him [be] the glory both now and forever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
