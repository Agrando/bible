If anyone has persuaded himself that he is Christ's, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he is Christ's, even so we are Christ's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For even if I should boast somewhat more concerning our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I will not be ashamed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>lest I seem to terrify you by my letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"For his letters,"they say, "are severe and boisterous, but his bodily presence [is] feeble, and his speech amounts to nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a person consider this, that of what sort we are in word by letters when we are absent, of such a kind [we will] also [be] in deed when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we dare not to class ourselves or to compare ourselves with those who commend themselves, but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, do not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not boast beyond limits, but according to the measure of the sphere [of influence ]which God assigned us as a measure, to reach even as far as you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we are not overextending ourselves, as though our authority did not reach to you, for it was to you that we came with the gospel of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>not boasting beyond the limits in the labors of others, but having hope, that as your faith is increased, we shall be greatly enlarged by you according to our sphere [of influence],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to preach the gospel to the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in the things done in the sphere [of influence] of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But "he who boasts, let him boast in the LORD."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For not he who commends himself is approved, but he[ ]whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
