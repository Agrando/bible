And I hope that you will understand, even until the end</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>just as also you have understood us in part, that we are your boasting, as indeed you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in this confidence I intended to come to you earlier, that you might have a second benefit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and through you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be sent on to Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, when I decided this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I decide, do I decide according to the flesh, that there may be with me "Yes, Yes,"and "No, No?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But [as ]God [is] faithful, our word unto you was not "Yes and no."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us-by me, Silvanus, and Timothy-was not "Yes and no,"but in Him was "Yes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For all the promises of God in Him [are] "Yes,"and in Him "Amen,"to the glory of God through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now He who establishes us together with you in Christ and who has anointed us is God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who also has sealed us, and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover I call upon God as a witness against my soul, that in order to spare you, I came no more to Corinth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not that we lord it over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
