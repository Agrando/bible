And I also hope to have been made known in your consciences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give to you an opportunity of boasting on our behalf, so that you may have [an answer] for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if we were beside ourselves, it [was] for God; or if we are of sound mind, [it is] for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the love of Christ compels us, having concluded this: that if One died for all, then all died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and He died for all, so that they who live should live no longer for themselves, but for the [One] who died for them and rose again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know [Him thus] no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things passed away; behold, all things have become new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all things are of God, who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and who gave to us the ministry of this reconciliation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not reckoning their transgressions to them, and committing to us the word of this reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now then, we serve as ambassadors for Christ, as though God were appealing through us: we implore [you] on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
