"By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have previously said, and I say beforehand, as being present the second [time], and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare [you,]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>since you are seeking proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but strong in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For although He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we are weak in Him, yet we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Scrutinize yourselves as to whether you are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed you are reprobates?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is honorable, though we may be as reprobates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For we can do nothing against the truth, but on behalf of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because of this I write these things being absent, in order that when I am present I may not deal sharply with you, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for edification and not for destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Finally brothers, farewell. Restore [yourselves,] comfort [yourselves], be in agreement, be at peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the saints greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
