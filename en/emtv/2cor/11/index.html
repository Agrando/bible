And in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and so I will keep myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As the truth of Christ is in me, that this boasting will not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I am doing, I will also continue to do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those who desire an opportunity, that in what they boast they may be found just as we [are].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Again I say, let no one think me a fool. Otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I also will boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For you bear with fools gladly, being wise [yourselves]!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes from you, if someone exalts himself, if someone strikes you in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To our shame, I say that we were too weak [for that]! But in whatever anyone is bold (I speak foolishly) I am bold also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I [am] even more: in labors far more, in beatings immeasurably, in imprisonments far more, in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By [the] Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have spent in the depth [of the sea].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers from my own race, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brothers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>in labor and hardship, in sleepless nights often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>apart from what I leave unmentioned, what comes against me daily: the anxiety for all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn [with indignation]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must boast, I will boast about the things concerning my weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to arrest me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped from his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
