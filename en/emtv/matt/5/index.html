It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and to be trampled underfoot by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on everything in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and they may glorify your Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For assuredly I say to you, until heaven and earth may pass away, one iota or one tittle shall by no means pass away from the law until all things are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men thus, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does [them] and teaches [them], he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not kill,' and whoever kills will be liable to the judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you that whoever gets angry with his brother without cause will be liable to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Empty-head!' will be liable to the council. But whoever says, ' fool!' will be liable to the fiery hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if you offer your gift on the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave your gift there before the altar, and go, first be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Make friends with your adversary quickly, while you are on the road with him, lest your adversary hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Assuredly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you, that whoever looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery [with] her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members be lost, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members be lost, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Furthermore it has been said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a divorce certificate.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorcee commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not swear falsely, but you shall pay your oaths to the Lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God's throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nor shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your word be 'Yes', 'yes,'; [or ]'No,' 'no.' For whatever is more than these is from the evil [one].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I say to you not to resist an evil person. But whoever shall slap you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And to the [one] desiring to sue you and to take your tunic, let him have your cloak also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to the [one] asking you, and to the [one] desiring to borrow from you, do not turn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and you shall hate your enemy.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>so that you may prove to be sons of your Father in heaven; because He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and He sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you greet your friends only, what more are you doing [than others]? Do not even the tax collectors do so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You therefore be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
