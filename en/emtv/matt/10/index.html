Freely you have received, freely give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not acquire gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>not a knapsack for the road, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whatever city or village you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there until you go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as you enter into a household, greet it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if indeed the house should be worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it should not be worthy, let your peace return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Assuredly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Behold, I am sending you forth like sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and innocent as doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But beware of men, for they will hand you over to councils and they will flog you in their synagogues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But whenever they hand you over, do not worry how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for you are not the [ones] speaking, but the Spirit of your Father who is speaking in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now brother will hand over brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents, and put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you will be hated by all [people ]for My name's sake. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But whenever they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly I say to you, by no means will you have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is enough for a disciple that he become like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call his household members!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore do not fear them. For nothing is concealed that shall not be unveiled, and secret that shall not be made known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"What I say to you in the dark, say in the light; and what you hear in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both the soul and the body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them shall fall on the ground apart from the [will] of your Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore do not fear; you are worth more than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"Therefore whoever who will confess Me before men, I also will confess Him before My Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whoever denies Me before men, I also will deny him before My Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Do not suppose that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I have come to 'turn a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and 'a man's enemies [will be] his own household members.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"He that receives you receives Me, and he that receives Me receives Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward. And he that receives a righteous [man] in the name of a righteous [man] shall receive a righteous [man's] reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whoever gives one of these little [ones] only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, assuredly I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
