But just say the word and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this [one], 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who were following, "Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I say to you that many shall come from east and west, and recline [to eat] with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; and as you believed, may it be unto you."And his servant was healed that same hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when Jesus had come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's mother having been laid up, and burning with fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up, and began to serve Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and He healed all that were ill,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: "He Himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Jesus saw great crowds around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then a certain scribe approached, and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then another of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus said to him, "Follow Me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold, a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered by waves; but He was sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the disciples came and awoke Him, saying, "Lord, save us! We are perishing!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O [you] of little faith?"Then having risen, He rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the men marveled, saying, "What kind [of Man] is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when He came to the other side, to the region of the Gergesenes, [there] met Him two demon-possessed [men], coming out of the tombs; exceedingly violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And suddenly they cried out, saying, "What have we to do with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the demons implored Him, saying, "If You cast us out, permit us to go off into the herd of swine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And He said to them, "Go."So they came out, and went off into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of swine rushed violently down the steep bank into the sea, and died in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then those who tended them fled; and going off into the city, they reported everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And seeing Him, they implored Him that He might go away from their region.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
