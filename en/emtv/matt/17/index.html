Hear Him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and they were greatly afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus approached and touched them and said, "Arise, and do not be afraid."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, "Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is risen from the dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And His disciples asked Him, saying, "Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered and said to them, "Elijah truly does come first, and shall restore all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they desired. Thus also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they came to the crowd, a man approached Him, kneeling to Him, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Lord, have pity on my son, for he is moonstruck and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So I brought him to Your disciples, but they were not able to heal him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jesus answered and said, "O unfaithful and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out from him; and the boy was healed from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Jesus said to them, "Because of your unbelief; for assuredly I say to you, if you have faith like a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, 'Be moved from here to there,' and it shall move; and nothing shall be impossible for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, "The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they will kill Him, and on the third day He shall be raised."And they were exceedingly sorrowful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When they had come to Capernaum, those who collected the temple tax came to Peter and said, "Does your Teacher not pay the temple tax?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said, "Yes."And when he entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter said to Him, "From strangers."Jesus said to him, "Then the sons are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nevertheless, lest we offend them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook, and take the first fish coming up. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a coin; taking that, give it to them for Me and you."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
