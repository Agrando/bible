And when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Have courage, child; your sins are forgiven you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And at once some of the scribes said among themselves, "This Man blasphemes!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise and walk'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins"-then He said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And having arisen, he went off to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now when the crowds saw, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me."And arising, he followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now it came to pass, as He reclined [to eat] in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners, having come, were reclining [to eat] with Jesus and His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Jesus heard that, He said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' For I did not come to call [the ]righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the disciples of John approached Him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No one puts on a patch of a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for it takes away its completeness from the garment, and the tear is made worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins burst, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins will be ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As He spoke these things to them, behold, a certain leader came and worshipped Him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she shall live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Jesus arose and followed him, likewise His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, a woman hemorrhaging for twelve years, approaching from behind, touched the hem of His garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For she said to herself, "If only I may touch His garment, I will be healed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you."And the woman was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Jesus came into the house of the leader, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said to them, "Make room, for the girl has not died, but she is sleeping."And they were ridiculing Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the crowd had been put out, He went in and grasped her hand, and the little girl arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the report of this went out into that whole land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind [men] followed Him, crying out and saying, "Son of David, have pity on us!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when He came into the house, the blind [men] approached Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith, let it be unto you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See [that you] let no one know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they, having gone out, spread the news about Him in that whole land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And as they were going out, behold, they brought to Him a mute man, being demon-possessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, "It was never seen like this in Israel!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees said, "By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus was going about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every illness and every disease among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and prostrated, like sheep having no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then He said to His disciples, "Indeed the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore pray to the Lord of the harvest, that He may send forth workers into His harvest."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
