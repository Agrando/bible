A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft garments are in kings' houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and far more [than] a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is he about whom it is written: 'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Assuredly I say to you, among [those] born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; but he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and violent men seize it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, the [one] who is about to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who has ears to hear, let him hear!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to what shall I compare this generation? It is similar to children who sit in the marketplaces and call to their playmates,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and say, 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; We mourned to you, and you did not lament.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' And so wisdom is justified by her children."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then He began to reproach the cities in which His very many miracles had been done, because they did not repent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Capernaum, the [one] having been exalted to heaven, you will be brought down to Hades; because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone fully know the Father except the Son, and [the one] to whom the Son wills to reveal [Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to Me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
