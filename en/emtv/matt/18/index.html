For offenses must come, but woe to that man through whom the offense comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut them off and cast [them] from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, than having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, than having two eyes, to be thrown into the fiery hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"See that you do not despise one of these little [ones], for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>What do you think? If a certain man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains, and go and search for the [one ]gone astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he happens to find it, assuredly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which did not go astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus it is not the will before your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"And if your brother sins against you, go and show him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have won your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he does not hear, take along with you one or two more, so that 'by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the assembly. But if he refuses even to hear the assembly, let him be to you as a heathen and a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Assuredly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, assuredly I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about anything that they may ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in their midst."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter came to Him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy- seven [times.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he began to settle up, one debtor was brought to him [owing] ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But since he had nothing with which to repay, his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and everything that he had, and to be repaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore falling down before him, the servant said, 'Master, have patience with me, and I will repay everything to you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"And having compassion, the master of that servant released him, and forgave him the loan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And taking hold of him, he was choking him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and kept begging him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"But he was not willing, but going off, he cast him into prison till he should pay back what was owed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and they came and narrated to their master all that had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then summoning him, his master said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, as I also had compassion on you?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"And being angered, his master handed him over to the tormentors until he should pay all that was owed to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus also My heavenly Father will do to you, if you do not forgive each [one] his brother their trespasses, from your hearts."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
