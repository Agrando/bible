For He is risen, just as He said. Come; see the place where the Lord was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly and tell His disciples that He is risen from the dead, and behold, He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him. Behold, I have told you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to report to His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they were going to report to His disciples, that behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"So they came and held His feet and worshipped Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go, report to My brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they had assembled with the elders and taking counsel, they gave sufficient silver [coins] to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, "Tell them, 'His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"And if this reaches the governor's ears, we will influence him and make you secure."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the silver and did as they were instructed. And this saying has been widely spread among the Jews until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw Him, they worshipped Him; but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go [therefore] and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
