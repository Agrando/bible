Enter into the joy of your lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"And also the [one ]receiving the two talents came and said, 'Lord, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents besides them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"His lord said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Then the [one] having received the one talent came and said, 'Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And being afraid, I went off and hid your talent in the ground. Look, you have what is yours.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"But his lord answered and said to him, 'You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received what is mine with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to everyone who has, [more] shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but to him who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And cast the useless servant into the darkness outside. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"And when the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then will He sit upon His glorious throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on [His] left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the King will say to those on His right hand, 'Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"And the King will answer and say to them, 'Assuredly I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers, you did it to Me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"Then He will also say to those on the left, 'Depart from Me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and we did not minister to You?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"Then He will answer them, saying, 'Assuredly I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither did you do it to Me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
