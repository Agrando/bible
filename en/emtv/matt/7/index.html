First remove the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For everyone that asks receives, and he that seeks finds, and to him that knocks, it shall be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or what man is there among you who, if his son should ask for bread, will give to him a stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if he should ask for a fish, he will give to him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, by how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, thus also you do to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Enter in through the narrow gate; because wide is the gate, and broad is the way which leads to destruction, and many are those who enter in through it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How narrow the gate, and confined the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"But beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grape clusters from thorns, or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot produce evil fruit, nor can a rotten tree produce good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Consequently, by their fruits you shall know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name we cast out demons, and in Your name we did many mighty works?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"And then I will confess to them, 'I never knew you! Depart from Me, you who work iniquity!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Therefore, everyone who hears these words of Mine and does them, I will compare him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and fell against that house; and it did not fall, for it had been founded upon the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not do them, will be compared to a foolish man who built his house on the sand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And its fall was great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And so it was, when Jesus finished these words, the crowds were astonished at His teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for He taught them as one having authority, and not like the scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
