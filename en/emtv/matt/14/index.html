But when the crowds heard it, they followed Him on foot from the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And coming out, Jesus saw a large crowd, and He was moved with compassion towards them, and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when evening came, His disciples came to Him, saying, "The place is deserted, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds, that they may go to the villages and buy food for themselves."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said to them, "They do not need to go away. You give them [food] to eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they said to Him, "We do not have [anything ]here except five loaves of bread and two fish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But He said, "Bring them here to Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, taking the five loaves of bread and the two fish, looking up to heaven, He blessed, and breaking [them,] He[ ] gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples [gave] to the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So they all ate and were satisfied, and they took up what they had left of the fragments, twelve baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now those who had eaten were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And immediately Jesus compelled the disciples to get into the boat, and to go ahead of Him to the other side, until He could dismiss the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having dismissed the crowds, He went up on the mountain privately to pray. And when evening had come, He was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the boat was now in the middle of the sea, being harassed by the waves, for the wind was against [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, "It is a ghost!"And they cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, "Have courage! [It is] I AM; do not fear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Peter answered Him and said, "Lord, if it is You, command me to come to You on the waters."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So He said, "Come."And stepping down from the boat, Peter walked on the waters to go toward Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But seeing the strong wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, "Lord, save me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And immediately, Jesus reaching out His hand, laid hold of him, and said to him, "O you of little faith, why did you doubt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they had gotten into the boat, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then those who were in the boat came and worshipped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the men of that place recognized Him, they sent out into all that surrounding region, and they brought to Him all those who were ill,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and begged Him that they might only touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched [Him] were completely healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
