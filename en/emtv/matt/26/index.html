For she has done a beautiful work for Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For you have the poor with you always, but Me you do not have always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For this [woman], having put this perfume on My body, she did [it] for My burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Assuredly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this [woman] did will be spoken as a memorial to her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?"And they weighed out for him thirty silver [coins].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from then [on] he sought an opportunity to betray Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now on the first day of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, "Where do You desire [that] we shall prepare for You to eat the Passover?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; at your house I will keep the Passover with My disciples."' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when it was evening, He was reclining [to eat] with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now while they were eating, He said, "Assuredly I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And becoming exceedingly sorrowful, each of them began to say to Him, "[Surely] not I am [the one], Lord?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He answered and said, "He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl will betray Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Indeed, the Son of Man goes just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Judas, the [one] betraying Him, answered and said, "[Surely ]not I am [the one], Rabbi?"He said to him, "You have said [it]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took the bread, and giving thanks, He broke [it], and gave [it] to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, "Drink of it, all [of you],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many, for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I say to you, that I will by no means drink of this fruit of the vine from now [on,] until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And having sung hymns, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of Me on this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter answered and said to Him, "Even if all are made to stumble because of You, yet I will never be made to stumble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I say to you that on this night, before [the] rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, by no means will I deny You!"And likewise said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go off and pray [over] there."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You [will]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What? Were you not strong [enough] to watch with Me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. Indeed the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, let Your will be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And leaving them, He went away again, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, "Sleep now, and rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise up, let us be going. See, he who betrays Me is at hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, [sent] from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now the [one] betraying Him had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I shall kiss, He is [the One]; seize Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And immediately he went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!"and kissed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus said to him, "Friend, why have you come?"Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, he cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Or do you think that I cannot now call upon My Father, and He will furnish Me with more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to arrest Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled."Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And those having seized Jesus led [Him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter was following Him from a distance, up to the courtyard of the high priest. And entering inside, he sat down with the attendants to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the Sanhedrin were seeking false witnesses against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and they did not find [any]. And though many false witnesses came forward, they did not find [any]. But at last two false witnesses came forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said, "This [Man] said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And standing up the high priest said to Him, "Do You answer nothing? What is it these men are testifying against You?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, "I adjure You by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him, "You said [it]. Nevertheless, I say to you, from now [on,] you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard His blasphemy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What do you think?"They answered and said, "He is deserving of death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spat in His face, and beat Him with [their] fists; and they slapped [Him,]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is he that struck You?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are saying."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he had gone out to the gateway, another [girl] saw him and said to them there, "This [man] was with Jesus the Nazarene."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>But again he denied with an oath, "I do not know the Man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a little [while], those standing by came up and said to Peter, "Surely you also are one of them, for your accent gives you away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the Man!"And immediately a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which He said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."And going out, he wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
