Otherwise, you have not a reward from your Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Whenever therefore you do charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by men. Assuredly I say to you, they receive their reward in full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when you do charitable giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>so that your charitable giving may be in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will Himself reward you openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"And whenever you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and on the streetcorners, so that they may be seen by men. Assuredly I say to you, that they receive their reward in full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you, whenever you pray, enter into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when you pray, do not babble like the heathen, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows what things[ ]you have need of before you ask Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore pray in this manner: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as [it is ]in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give us this day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil [one]. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Moreover, when you fast, do not become gloomy, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men [to be] fasting. Assuredly I say to you, that they receive their reward in full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so that you do not appear to men [to be] fasting, but to your Father in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves dig through and steal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupts, and where thieves do not dig through and steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"No one is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and he will love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one, and he will despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Because of this I say to you, do not worry [about ]your life-what you shall eat, or what you shall drink-nor [about] your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food and the body [more than] clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap, nor do they gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Which of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his stature?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So why do you worry about clothes? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither labor, nor spin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and yet I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if God thus clothes the grass of the field, which exists today, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, [will He] not much more [clothe] you, [O you] of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we put on?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own affairs. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
