So they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again going out about the sixth and the ninth hour, he did likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And about the eleventh hour, going out he found others standing idle, and said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you shall receive.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"So when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"And when those came [who were hired] about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they also received each a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they had received it, they began grumbling against the landowner,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, 'These last [men] have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"But he answered one of them and said, 'Friend, I am not wronging you. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take what is yours and go. But I want to give to this last [man] the same as to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own [things]? Or is your eye evil because I am good?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Thus the last shall be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few [are ]chosen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took aside the twelve disciples privately on the road, and He said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and they will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He shall rise again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Him with her sons, worshipping [Him,] and asking something from Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He said to her, "What do you desire?"She said to Him, "Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and one on Your left, in Your kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus answered and said, "You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup which I am about to drink, or to be baptized [with] the baptism that I am baptized with?"They said to Him, "We are able."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So He said to them, "You will indeed drink My cup, and be baptized with the baptism [with ]which I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is to [those] for whom it has been prepared by My Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus, having summoned them, said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, shall be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life [as ]a ransom for many."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now as they went out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, two blind men sitting alongside the road, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, "Have pity on us, O Lord, Son of David!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the crowd warned them that they should be silent; but they cried out all the more, saying, "Have pity on us, O Lord, Son of David!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And having stood still, Jesus called them, and said, "What do you desire [that] I should do for you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They said to Him, "Lord, that our eyes may be opened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus, having compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
