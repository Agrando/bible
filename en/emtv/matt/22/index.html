Come to the wedding."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"But not caring, they went away, one to his own field, another to his business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the rest seized his servants, mistreated [them], and killed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when that king heard, he was furious. And he sent out his troops, and he destroyed those murderers, and he burned up their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding indeed is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding [hall] was filled with guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there not dressed with wedding clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here not having wedding clothes?' And he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king said to the servants, 'Tie him up hands and feet, take him away, and cast [him] into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"For many are called, but few are chosen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went and plotted how they might trap Him in His speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent their disciples to Him with the Herodians, saying, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and teach the way of God in truth; nor do You show favoritism to anyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, "Why do you test Me, [you] hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show Me the tax money."So they brought Him a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said to Him, "Caesar's."And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they had heard these words, they marveled, and leaving Him, they went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him, and they questioned Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying: "Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife as next of kin, and shall raise up offspring for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were with us seven brothers. The first died, after having married, and having no offspring, he left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the second also, and the third, up to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For [they] all had her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, "You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection neither do they marry, nor are they given in marriage, but they are like angels of God in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the crowds heard [this], they were astonished at His teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the first and great commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He?"They said to Him, "David's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said to them, "How then does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet"'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"If David therefore calls Him 'Lord,' how is He his Son?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare question Him any longer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
