You see to it!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And throwing the silver [coins] in the sanctuary, he departed; and going away, he hanged himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the chief priests, taking the silver [coins] said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since they are the price of blood."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And taking counsel, they bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then was fulfilled the thing spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty [coins], the value of Him who was priced, whom they of the sons of Israel priced,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"and they gave them for the potter's field, as the LORD directed me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?"So Jesus said to him, "It is as you say."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He answered him not one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now at the feast, the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore when they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you wish [that] I should release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now as he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas, but they should destroy Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you wish me to release to you?"They said, "Barabbas!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"They all said to him, "Let Him be crucified!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the governor said, "Why, what evil did He do?"But they cried out all the more, saying, "Let Him be crucified!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate, seeing that nothing was being gained, but rather a riot was starting, taking water, he washed his hands clean in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this just [Man]. You see to it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the people answered and said, "His blood [be] on us and on our children."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he released Barabbas to them; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus to the Praetorium, gathered the whole garrison around Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having stripped Him, they put a scarlet robe on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And spitting on Him, they took the reed and were striking [Him] on His head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe, and dressed Him in His own clothes, and led Him away in order to crucify [Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they pressed into service that he might carry His cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And coming to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they gave Him sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But having tasted it, He would not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And having crucified Him, they divided His clothes among themselves,[ ]casting lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And sitting down, they guarded Him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they put up over His head the crime having been written [against] Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then they crucified two thieves with Him, one on His right, and another on His left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and saying, "You[ ]who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking [Him ]with the scribes and elders, and Pharisees, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He'll [have] Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Even the thieves who were crucified with Him were reviling Him with the same [insult].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour, darkness came upon all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?"that is, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Some of those standing [by], when they heard this, said, "This [Man] is calling Elijah!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, and filled it with sour wine and put it around a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But the rest said, "Leave [Him] alone; let us see if Elijah is coming to save Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus, again crying out with a loud voice, released His spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had passed away were raised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and coming forth out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So when the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were greatly afraid, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And there were many women there observing from a distance, who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This [man] went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and placed it in his new tomb which he had cut in the rock; and having rolled a large stone [against] the door of the tomb, he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>On the next day, which is after the Preparation [Day], the chief priests and Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>saying, "Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while He was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>"Therefore command that the grave be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him, and say to the people, 'He was raised from the dead.' So the last deception will be worse [than] the first."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go make it as secure as you know [how]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>So they went and secured the grave, sealing the stone, with the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
