For they do not wash their hands whenever they eat bread."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He answered and said to them, "Why do you also transgress the commandment of God on account of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, with death let him die.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say, 'Whoever says to his father or mother, "[It is] a gift [to God], whatever profit you might have received from me"-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>then by no means should he honor his father or mother.' Thus you have nullified the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>'These people draw near to Me with their mouth, and they honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And having summoned the crowd, He said to them, "Hear and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then His disciples approached and said to Him, "You know that when the Pharisees heard this message they were offended?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But He answered and said, "Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guides the blind, both will fall into a ditch."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Peter answered and said to Him, "Explain to us this parable."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jesus said, "Are you also still without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach, and is cast out into a latrine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And going out from there, Jesus withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, a Canaanite woman coming forth from that region cried out to Him, saying, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But He answered her not a word. And His disciples approached and urged Him, saying, "Send her away, for she cries out after us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But He answered and said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then she came and worshipped Him, saying, "Lord, help me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and to throw [it] to the little dogs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said, "Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat from the crumbs falling from their masters' table."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered and said to her, "O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire."And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And moving on from there, Jesus came alongside the Sea of Galilee, and going up into a mountain, He sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others; and they put them down at Jesus' feet, and He healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now Jesus, having summoned His disciples, He said, "I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been remaining with Me three days, and they do not have anything to eat. And I do not desire to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then His disciples said to Him, "Where could we get so many loaves of bread in [this] deserted place, so as to satisfy so great a crowd?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?"And they said, "Seven, and a few small fish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So He commanded the crowds to recline on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He took the seven loaves and the fish, having given thanks, He broke [them], and gave [them] to His disciples; and the disciples [gave] to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what they had left of the fragments, seven hampers full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now those who ate were four thousand men, apart from women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having dismissed the crowds, He went up into the boat, and came to the region of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
