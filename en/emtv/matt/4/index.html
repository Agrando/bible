"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: 'He shall give His angels orders concerning you,' and, 'In their hands they will lift you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not tempt the LORD your God.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, the devil took Him up on a very high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to Him, "All these things will I give You, if You will fall down and worship me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him alone you shall serve.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He departed into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And leaving Nazareth behind, He came and settled down in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and to those who sat in the land and the shadow of death, light sprang up on them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now as He was walking alongside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then He said to them, "Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They immediately left their nets and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having gone forth from there, He saw two other brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus went about all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the report of Him went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all those who were ill, and [who were ]suffering with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And large crowds followed Him from Galilee and from Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
