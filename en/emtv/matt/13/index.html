This is the [seed] being sown beside the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the [seed] sown on stony ground, is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet he has no root in himself, but is short-lived. For when tribulation or persecution comes because of the word, immediately he falls away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the [seed] sown in the thorns is he who hears the word, and the anxiety of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches chokes out the word, and it becomes fruitless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the [seed] sown on the good ground is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundred[fold], some sixty, some thirty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable He set before them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man sowing good seed in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But while the men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the stalk had sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares also appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the servants of the master of the house approached and said to him, 'Sir, [was it ]not good seed you sowed in your field? From where then does it have tares?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Do you wish then that we should go and gather them up?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"But he said, 'No, lest gathering up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Leave both to grow together until the harvest; and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather together the tares, and bind them into bundles to burn them, but gather together the wheat into my barn."' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable He set before them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>which indeed is smaller [than] all the seeds; but whenever it is grown, it is greater [than] the garden vegetables and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable He spoke to them: "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and mixed in with three measures of meal, until the whole was leavened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus spoke all these things in parables to the crowds, and without a parable He did not speak to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: "I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things having been hidden from the foundation of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then having dismissed the crowds, Jesus went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, "Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered and said to them: "He that sows the good seed is the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the evil [one].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore just as the tares are gathered and burned with fire, thus it will be at the end of this age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who work iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure having been hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it, he went and sold everything he had, and bought that field."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who, when he found one very precious pearl, went and sold everything he had and bought it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet having been cast into the sea, and gathering some of every kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it was filled, they pulled up on the shore; and sitting down, they collected the good into vessels, but the rotten they threw out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Thus it shall be at the end of the age: the angels shall go forth and separate the evil from among the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said to them, "Have you understood all these things?"They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then He said to them, "Therefore every scribe having become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure new and old [things]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, He went away from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And coming into His hometown, He began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, "Where did this Man get this wisdom and the powerful works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is this not the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary? And His brothers James, Joses, Simon, and Jude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And His sisters, are they not all with us? From where then did this Man get all these things?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>So they were offended at Him. But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and in his [own ]house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And He did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
