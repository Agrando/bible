"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And John himself had his clothing [made] from camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan were going out to him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and do not think to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But even now, the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with [the] Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor, and He will gather His wheat into the barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus arrived from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But John [tried to ]prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and You are coming to me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."Then he permitted Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And having been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And behold, a voice came out of the heavens, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I have found delight."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
