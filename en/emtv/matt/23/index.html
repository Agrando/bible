They make their phylacteries broad and they enlarge the borders of their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They love the first couch in the suppers, and the best seats in the synagogues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, 'Rabbi, Rabbi.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"But you, do not be called 'Rabbi'; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not call [anyone] on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Neither be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the greatest of you shall be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And whoever shall exalt himself will be humbled, and whoever shall humble himself will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you shut up the kingdom of heaven before men; for you do not enter, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you travel around land and sea to make one proselyte, and whenever he becomes [one], you make him twice as much a son of hell as you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, is obligated.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, is obligated.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore he that swears by the altar, swears by it and by all the things on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He that swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he that swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you pay tithes of mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the more important [things] of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These things you should have done, and not have neglected the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Blind guides, you who strain out a gnat, but swallow a camel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and dish, so that the outside of them may be clean also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus also you outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"So that you testify against yourselves that you are sons of those who killed the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you, fill up then, the measure of your fathers' guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Serpents! Brood of vipers! How shall you escape from the condemnation of hell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore, behold, I send you prophets, wise [men], and scribes: some of them you will kill and you will crucify, and [some] of them you will flog in your synagogues and you will persecute from city to city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so that on you may come all the righteous blood being shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Assuredly I say to you, all these things shall come upon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [you] who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, your house is left to you desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For I say to you, you shall by no means see Me from now until you say, 'Blessed [is] He who comes in the name of the LORD!'
