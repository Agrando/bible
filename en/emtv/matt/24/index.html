Assuredly I say to you, by no means will a stone be left here upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And as He was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, "Tell us, when shall these things be? And what [shall be] the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered and said to them: "Take heed that no one deceives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For many will come in My name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See [that] you are not disturbed; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But all these things[ are ]the beginning of sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they will hand you over to tribulation and they will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations, on account of My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And then many will fall away, and they will betray one another, and they will hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then many false prophets will be raised up, and they will deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he who endures to the end shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed in all the world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Therefore when you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place"(whoever reads, let him understand),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then let those who are in Judea flee upon the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the [one] on the housetop not go down to take the things out of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And let the [one] in the field not turn back to take his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But woe to those [women ]who are pregnant, and to the [women] nursing a baby in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But pray that your flight may not take place in winter, nor [on] the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For then there shall be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until now, nor by any means shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days will be cut short.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if someone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There!' do not believe [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For false christs and false prophets will be raised up, and they will show great signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See, I have told you in advance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore if they should say to you, 'Look, He is in the desert!' do not go out; or 'Look, He is in the inner rooms!' do not believe [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as the lightning comes out from the east and flashes to the west, so shall also be the coming of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For wherever the carcass may be, there the eagles will be gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give its light; and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth shall mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"Now learn this parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch already becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So you also, whenever you see all these things, know that it is near-at the doors!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Assuredly I say to you, this generation shall by no means pass away till all these things are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But just as the days of Noah [were], so also shall be the coming of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For just as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and they didn't know [a thing] until the flood came and took [them] all away, so also shall be the coming of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then two will be in the field: one will be taken, and one will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken, and one will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Watch therefore, for you do not know in what hour your Lord is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have kept watch, and he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For this reason you also must be ready, for at an hour that you think not, the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master appointed over his household, to give them food in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Assuredly I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if that evil servant should say in his heart, 'My master is delaying to come,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"and should begin to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the master of that servant will come on a day which he does not expect, and in an hour which he does not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and he will cut him in two, and will appoint his share with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
