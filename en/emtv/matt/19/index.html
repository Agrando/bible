Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to Him, "Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, "Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, that whoever shall put away his wife, except [it be ]for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marrying a divorcee commits adultery."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples said to Him, "If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is better not to marry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But He said to them, "All cannot accept this saying, but [it is for those] to whom it has been given:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He who is able to accept [this], let him accept [it]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then little children were brought to Him, that He might put His hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, "Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having put His hands on them, He departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, one came and said to Him, "Good Teacher, what good [thing] shall I do that I may have eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So He said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, [that is], God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to Him, "Which [ones]?"Jesus said, "'You shall not murder,' 'You shall not commit adultery,' 'You shall not steal,' 'You shall not bear false witness,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>' Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said to Him, "All these have I kept from my youth. What do I still lack?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, "If you desire to be perfect, go, sell your belongings and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard the word, he went away grieved, for he had many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus said to His disciples, "Assuredly I say to you, that with difficulty a rich [man] shall enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than [for] a rich [man] to enter the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when His disciples heard, they were greatly astonished, saying, "Who then is able to be saved?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And looking on [them], Jesus said to them, "With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter answered and said to Him, "See, we have left all and followed You. What then shall we have?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Jesus said to them, "Assuredly I say to you, that in the Regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
