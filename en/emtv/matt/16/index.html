Hypocrites! Indeed you know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah."And leaving them behind He went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now when His disciples had come to the other side, they forgot to take bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said to them, "Look out and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But they were reasoning among themselves, saying, "We did not take bread."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Jesus, knowing [about it], said to them, "O you of little faith, why are you reasoning among yourselves, because you did not take bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not yet perceive, or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took [up]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many hampers you took [up]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How is it you do not perceive that I did not speak to you about bread, but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He was questioning His disciples, saying, "Who do men pronounce Me, the Son of Man, to be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So they said, "Some [say] John the Baptist, but others [say] Elijah, and [yet ]others [say ]Jeremiah, or one of the prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, "But who do you pronounce Me to be?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal [this] to you, but My Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I shall build My church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on the earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth will have been loosed in heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then He commanded His disciples that they should tell no one that He was Jesus the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go off to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And taking Him aside, Peter began to rebuke Him, saying, "God be gracious to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But He turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block unto Me, because you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus said to His disciples, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of Me shall find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give [as] an exchange for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will render to each according to his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Assuredly I say to you, there are some standing here who will by no means taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
