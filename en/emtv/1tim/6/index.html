Teach and exhort these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anyone teaches differently and does not consent to sound words, even those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which accords with godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is puffed up, understanding nothing, but [is] morbidly concerned with disputes and word battles, from which come envy, strife, slanders, evil suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>constant wranglings of men of corrupt minds and having been deprived of the truth, supposing that godliness is a means of profit. Withdraw from such [people].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain that neither can we carry anything out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But having food and clothing, with these things we shall be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But those desiring to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many senseless and harmful lusts which sink men into destruction and perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is[ the] root of all evil, of which some [by] aspiring have strayed away from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You however, O man of God, flee these things. But pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold of eternal life, to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I charge you before God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that you keep this commandment without spot, blameless until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>which He will show in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or is able to see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to put their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who provides all things richly for us to enjoy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, sharing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>storing up for yourselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy! Guard that which was committed to your trust, turning away from the profane and empty babblings and opposing views of what is falsely called "knowledge,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>which some, by professing [expertise,] missed the mark concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
