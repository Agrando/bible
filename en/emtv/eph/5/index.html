Walk as children of light-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And have no partnership with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is shameful even to speak of those things being done by them in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore He says: "Awake, you who are sleeping, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See then that you walk carefully, not as unwise, but as wise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord [is].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And do not get drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>giving thanks always concerning all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>because the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But just as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives be to their own husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your own wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in order that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water by the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he that loves his own wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also the Lord does the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is a great mystery, but I speak in reference to Christ and to the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless you also individually, let each one love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respect her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
