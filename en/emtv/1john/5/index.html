And His commandments are not burdensome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because everything having been born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that has overcome the world-your faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is he that overcomes the world, if not he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is He who came through water and blood-Jesus Christ, not only by the water, but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is He[ ]who witnesses, because the Spirit is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three that bear witness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; because this is the testimony of God which He has testified concerning His Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he that does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the testimony: that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that has the Son has life; he that does not have the Son of God does not have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things I write to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe in the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence that we have toward Him, that if we should ask anything according to His will, He hears us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that He hears us, whatever we may ask, we know that we have the requests that we have requested from Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not [leading] to death, he shall ask, and He shall give him life for those who do not sin unto death. There is a sin [leading] to death. I do not say that he should ask about that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not [leading] to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that everyone begotten of God does not sin; but he that was begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil [one] does not touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies [under the sway] of the evil [one].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is true; and we are in Him that is true, in His Son Jesus Christ.
