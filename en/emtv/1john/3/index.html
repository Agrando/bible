On account of this the world does not know you, because it did not know Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you know that He appeared that He might take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him nor has he known Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Little children, let no one deceive you. The [one] who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this [reason] the Son of God appeared, that He might destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>No one who has been born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>not as Cain who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his works were evil and the [works] of his brother were righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love his brother abides in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By this we have come to know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives on behalf of our brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother having need, and shuts off his compassion towards him, how does the love of God abide in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in this we know that we are from the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and He knows all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever we should ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and we do the things pleasing before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is His commandment: that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and should love one another, just as He gave commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the [one] who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, from the Spirit whom He gave us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
