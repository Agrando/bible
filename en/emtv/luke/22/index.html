Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now you are those who have remained with Me in My trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon! Behold, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he said to Him, "Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then He said, "I say to you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And He said to them, "When I sent you without a money bag, and a knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything?"And they said, "Nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then He said to them, "But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise also a knapsack; and he who has no sword shall sell his garment and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say to you that this which has been written must still be accomplished in Me-the [saying,] 'And He was numbered with the transgressors.' For the things concerning Me have a fulfillment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So they said, "Lord, look, here are two swords."And He said to them, "It is enough."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going out, He went to the Mount of Olives, according to His custom, and His disciples also followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having come to the place, He said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, "Father, if You will, remove this cup from Me-nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in agony, He prayed more fervently. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down onto the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And rising up from prayer, coming to the disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then He said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise up and pray, lest you enter into temptation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while He was still speaking, behold, a crowd; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said to him, "Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And those around Him, seeing what was about to happen, they said to Him, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus answered and said, "Stop right there."And touching his ear, He healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, "Have you come out, as against a bandit, with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not try to seize Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And having arrested Him, they led Him and brought Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter was following from a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now when they had lit a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a certain servant girl, seeing him sitting at the fire and gazing at him, said, "This [man] was also with Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied Him, saying, "Woman, I do not know Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little [while] another [person ]saw him and said, "You also are [one ]of them."But Peter said, "Man, I am not!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then after about one hour had passed, another was firmly insisting, saying, "Surely this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying!"And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, "Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And going outside, Peter wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Now the men who were holding Jesus were mocking Him and beating [Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And having blindfolded Him, they were striking His face and asking Him, saying, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And when it became day, the council of the elders of the people, the chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>"If You are the Messiah, tell us."But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will by no means believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But if I also question you, you will by no means answer Me or release [Me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then they all said, "Are You then the Son of God?"So He said to them, "You [rightly] say that I am."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, "What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
