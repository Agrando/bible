Or who is he who gave You this authority?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But He answered and said to them, "I also will ask you one thing, and so tell Me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The baptism of John-was it from heaven or from men?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they debated among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why [then] did you not believe him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded [that] John was a prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they answered that they did not know where it was from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then He began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to farmers, and went on a journey for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the farmers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers flogged him and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again he sent another servant; and they flogged him also, treated him shamefully, and sent [him] away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and threw [him] out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps when they see him they will respect [him].'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others."And when they heard it they said, "May it never be!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then He looked at them and said, "What then is this which is written: 'The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him that very hour, but they were afraid-for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having watched [Him] closely, they sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on His words, in order to deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they asked Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show favoritism, but teach the way of God in truth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But perceiving their craftiness, He said to them, "Why do you test Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?"They answered and said, "Caesar's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But they could not catch Him in His words in front of the people. And marveling at His answer, they kept silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then some of the Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, coming to Him and asked Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying: "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife, and this [man ]dies childless, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there were seven brothers. And the first, having taken a wife, died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the second took her as wife, and this [man ]died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and they died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife does she become? For all seven had her [as] wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But those who have been counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>nor can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now even Moses revealed that the dead are raised, in [the passage about] the [burning ]bush, when he called the Lord 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all are alive to Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then some of the scribes answered and said, "Teacher, You have spoken well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But after that they dared not question Him anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He said to them, "How [is it that] they say the Christ is the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Even David himself said in the Book of Psalms, 'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Therefore David calls Him 'Lord'; how is He then his Son?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And as all the people listened, He said to His disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk about in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at dinners,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
