And as he sowed, some fell alongside the road; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And other [seed] fell on rock; and when it grew up, it withered away because it had no moisture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And other [seed] fell among thorns, and when the thorns grew up with it, they choked it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But other [seed] fell into good ground, and when it grew up, it produced fruit a hundredfold."Saying these things He was calling out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then His disciples asked Him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest [they are] in parables, that 'Seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Now this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And those beside the road are they that hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, lest they believe and be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But those on the rock are they that, whenever they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of testing fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And that which fell among thorns, these are those, who when they heard, go out and are choked with anxieties, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But that which fell on the good ground, these are such who when they heard the word, with a noble and good heart, hold on to it and bear fruit with endurance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts [it] under a bed, but sets it on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest, nor anything concealed which will not be known and come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, [more] shall be given to him; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it was told Him by some, who said, "Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But He answered and said to them, "My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now it came to pass on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, "Let us go across to the other side of the lake."And they put out to sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down onto the lake, and they were being filled [with water], and were in danger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!"Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But He said to them, "Where is your faith?"But becoming afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, "Who then is this? For He commands both the winds and the water, and they obey Him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they sailed to the region of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when He got out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house, but among the tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And seeing Jesus and crying out, he fell down before Him, and with a loud voice he said, "What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For it had seized him at times, and he was bound, kept under guard, with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus asked him, saying, "What is your name?"And he said, "Legion,"because many demons had entered into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he kept imploring Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain. And they kept imploring Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then when the demons came out from the man, they entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when those who fed [them] saw what had happened, they fled and reported [it] in the city and in the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had come out [of], sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and being of sound mind. And they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And those also who saw reported to them how the demon-possessed man was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then the whole multitude from the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to go away from them, because they were gripped with great fear. And He got into the boat and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now the man from whom the demons had come out was begging Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"Return to your house, and tell what great things God has done for you."And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city all the things that Jesus did for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So it was, when Jesus returned, that the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a leader of the synagogue. And falling at the feet of Jesus, he was imploring Him to enter into his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He was going, the crowds were pressing against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who though she had spent [her] whole livelihood on physicians, was not able to be healed by anyone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>approaching from behind, touched the hem of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jesus said, "Who touched Me?"When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the crowds are pressing You hard and crowding You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But Jesus said, "Someone touched Me, for I perceived that power has gone out from Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she recounted to Him before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And He said to her, "Take courage, daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, "Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, "Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be healed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>When He came into the house, He permitted no one to enter except Peter, John, and James, and the father and mother of the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Now all were weeping and mourning for her; but He said, "Do not weep; she is not dead, but asleep."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they were ridiculing Him, knowing that she had died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But He sent them all outside, and having grasped her hand, He called, saying, "Child, arise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded [something] to be given to her to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And her parents were amazed, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
