And when He was already not far away from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, "Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You. But [just] say the word, and my servant shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I also am a man appointed under authority, having soldiers under myself. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does [it]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, "I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when those who were sent returned to the house, they found the servant well who had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now it happened on the next [day], that He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, and a great crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when He came near the gate of the city, that behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And many people from the city was with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He gave him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then fear took hold of all, and they were glorifying God, saying, "A great prophet has risen up among us"; and, "God has visited His people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this report about Him went out in all Judea, and all the surrounding region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And summoning two of his disciples, John sent [them] to Jesus, saying, "Are You the Coming [One], or do we look for another?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they came to Him, the men said, "John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, 'Are You the Coming [One], or do we look for another?' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in that very hour He healed many from diseases, and torments, and evil spirits; and to many blind [people] He granted sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: that the blind regain sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are evangelized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when John's messengers had departed, He began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What have you gone out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But what have you gone out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in royal [palaces].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what have you gone out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is he about whom it is written: 'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"For I say to you, among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater [than] he."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when all the people heard Him, even the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God for themselves, because they had not been baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Therefore to what shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying: 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned for you, and you did not weep.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And so wisdom is justified by all her children."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And entering into the Pharisee's house, He reclined [to eat].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she found out that He was reclining in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of perfume,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and standing by His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and was wiping [them] with the hair of her head; and she was kissing His feet and anointing [them] with the perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke within himself, saying, "This [Man], if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman [this is] who touches Him, for she is a sinner."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you."And he said, "Teacher, say it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other [owed ]fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when they had nothing with which to pay back, he freely forgave them both. Tell [Me], therefore, which of them will love him more?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answered and said, "I suppose [it is the one] to whom he forgave more."And He said to him, "You have judged correctly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered into your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but this [woman] has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You gave Me no kiss, but this [woman] has not stopped kissing My feet since the time I came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>You did not anoint My head with oil, but this [woman] has anointed My feet with perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For which reason I say to you, her many sins have been forgiven, because she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say within themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
