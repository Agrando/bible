And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, that they might do for Him according to the custom of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Lord, now You are releasing Your servant in peace, according to Your word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for my eyes have seen Your salvation</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a light for a revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory to Your people Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Joseph and His mother were marveling at the things being spoken about Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, "Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>(yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and she [was] a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And coming in that instant she was giving thanks to the Lord, and was speaking about Him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the Child was growing and becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And His parents traveled to Jerusalem every year to the Feast of the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when He was twelve years old, when they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and when they completed the days, while they were returning, the Child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and Joseph and His mother did not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But supposing Him to be in the caravan, they went a day's journey, and sought Him among their relatives and among their acquaintances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Now it came to pass that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And those who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and His answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, "Child, why have You treated us this way? Look, Your father and I were seeking You anxiously."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And He said to them, "Why [is it] that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And His mother kept all these things in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
