And taking hold of him, He healed him, and let [him] go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then He answered them, saying, "Which of you, having a son or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they were not able to answer Him regarding these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So He told a parable to those who were invited, when He noted how they chose the places of honor, saying to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Whenever you are invited by someone to a wedding celebration, do not sit down in the place of honor, lest one more honorable than you be invited by him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he who invited you and him shall come and say to you, 'Give place to this [man],' and then you begin with shame to take the last place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when you are invited, go and sit down in the last place, so that when he who invited you comes, he shall say to you, 'Friend, go up higher.' Then you will have glory in the presence of those who recline with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then He also said to him who invited Him, "When you give a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your relatives, nor rich neighbors, lest they also invite you back, and you be repaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But whenever you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and you will be blessed, because they do not have [anything] to repay you; for it will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the just."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when one of those who sat at the table with Him heard these things, he said to Him, "Blessed is he who shall eat dinner in the kingdom of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then He said to him, "A certain man gave a great dinner, and he invited many,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he sent his servant at dinnertime to say to those who were invited, 'Come, for all things are now ready.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they all with one [accord] began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, 'I bought a field, and I must go and see it. I ask you, have me excused.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And another said, 'I bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going to test them. I ask you, have me excused.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Still another said, 'I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the servant said, 'Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the master said to the servant, 'Go out into the roads and hedges, and compel [them] to come in, so that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now great crowds were traveling with Him. And turning, He said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which of you, intending to build a tower, [does] not first sit down and count up the cost, whether he has the resources to complete it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lest perhaps after he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all those who see it begin to mock him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king, going to engage another king in battle, [does] not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Otherwise, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks the [terms] for peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So likewise, every one of you who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be My disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Salt is good; but if the salt becomes tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is neither fit for the land nor for the dunghill, but men cast it out. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
