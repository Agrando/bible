You take up what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to him, 'Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I did not deposit, and reaping what I did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Why then did you not give my money to a bank, and when I came, I would have collected it with interest?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to those standing by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"But they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For I say to you that to everyone who has, [more] shall be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nevertheless bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay [them] before me.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having said these things, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, as He drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, to the mountain which is called Olivet, that He sent two of His disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, "Go into the village opposite you, in which when you enter you will find a colt tied up, on which no one of men has ever sat. Loose him and bring [him] [here].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you loosing [him]?' thus you shall say to him, 'Because the Lord has need of him.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So those who were sent departed and found it just as He told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, "Why are you loosing the colt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, "The Lord has need of him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they brought him to Jesus. And when they threw their own clothes on the colt, they set Jesus on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as He went, they were spreading their clothes under [Him] on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as He was approaching the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying: "'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the LORD!' Peace in heaven and glory in the highest! "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees said to Him from the crowd, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But He answered and said to them, "I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And as He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, "If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things pertaining to your peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and hem you in from every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and they will level you to the ground, and your children with you; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know the season of your visitation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when He entered into the temple, He began to drive out those buying and selling in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, "It is written, 'My house is a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of thieves.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people were seeking to destroy Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and were unable to do anything; for all the people were very attentive to hear Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
