If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day he returns, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the Lord said, "If you have faith as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and be planted in the sea,' and it would obey you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And which of you, having a servant plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, 'Come and recline [to eat]'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But will he not say to him, 'Prepare something [that] I may dine, and gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Does he thank that servant because he did the things having been commanded? I think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So likewise you, whenever you do all the things having been commanded to you, say, 'We are unprofitable servants. We have done what we ought to do.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened while He was traveling to Jerusalem that He passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then as He entered a certain village, there met Him ten men who were lepers, who stood at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they lifted [their] voice and said, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And seeing [them], He said to them, "Go, show yourselves to the priests."And so it was that as they went away, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, seeing that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and fell down on his face at His feet, thanking Him. And he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Jesus answered and said, "Were there not ten cleansed? But where [are] the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Were not any found returning to give glory to God except this foreigner?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He said to him, "Arise, go [your way]. Your faith has made you well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>neither will they say, 'Look here!' or 'Look, there [it is]!' For behold, the kingdom of God is among you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then He said to the disciples, "Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you shall not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say to you, 'Look here!' or 'Look there!' Do not go forth nor follow [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For just as the lightning which flashes out of the [one part] under heaven shines to the [other part] under heaven, so [also] the Son of Man will be in His day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first He must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And just as it happened in the days of Noah, so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and the flood came and destroyed [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise also as it happened in the days of Lot; they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In the same way it shall be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, [he] who shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away. And likewise he who is in the field, let him not turn back for the things[ left] behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever seeks to save his life shall lose it, and whoever loses his life shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I say to you, in that night two shall be on one bed: one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two shall be grinding together: one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>- - -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they answered and said to Him, "Where, Lord?"So He said to them, "Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
