"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he said to the crowds which came out to be baptized by him, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And even now the ax is being laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and is thrown into the fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the people were asking him, saying, "What shall we do then?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered and said to them, "He who has two shirts, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, "Collect nothing more than the [amount] which has been commanded to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Likewise the soldiers also were asking him, saying, "And what shall we do?"So he said to them, "Do not intimidate anyone or accuse [anyone ]falsely, and be content with your wages."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now while the people waited, and all considered in their hearts about John, whether he might be the Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>John answered, saying to all, "I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into His barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And with many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>he also added this to all [his other] [sins], and locked up John in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now it came to pass that when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also was baptized, and [was] praying, [that ]the heaven was opened;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came out of heaven, saying, "You are My beloved Son; in You I have found delight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now Jesus Himself began His ministry at about thirty years of age, being (as it was supposed) the son of Joseph, the [son] of Heli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the [son] of Matthat, the [son] of Levi, the [son] of Melchi, the [son] of Janna, the [son] of Joseph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the [son] of Mattathiah, the [son] of Amos, the [son] of Nahum, the [son] of Esli, the [son] of Naggai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the [son] of Maath, the [son] of Mattathiah, the [son] of Semei, the [son] of Joseph, the [son] of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the [son] of Joannas, the [son] of Rhesa, the [son] of Zerubbabel, the [son] of Shealtiel, the [son] of Neri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>the [son] of Melchi, the [son] of Addi, the [son] of Cosam, the [son] of Elmodam, the [son] of Er,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>the [son] of Jose, the [son] of Eliezer, the [son] of Jorim, the [son] of Matthat, the [son] of Levi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the [son] of Simeon, the [son] of Judah, the [son] of Joseph, the [son] of Jonan, the [son] of Eliakim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the [son] of Melea, the [son] of Menan, the [son] of Mattathah, the [son] of Nathan, the [son] of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the [son] of Jesse, the [son] of Obed, the [son] of Boaz, the [son] of Salmon, the [son] of Nahshon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>the [son] of Amminadab, the [son] of Aram, the [son ]of Joram, the [son] of Hezron, the [son] of Perez, the [son] of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the [son] of Jacob, the [son] of Isaac, the [son] of Abraham, the [son] of Terah, the [son] of Nahor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the [son] of Serug, the [son] of Reu, the [son] of Peleg, the [son] of Eber, the [son] of Shelah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>the [son] of Cainan, the [son] of Arphaxad, the [son] of Shem, the [son] of Noah, the [son] of Lamech,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>the [son] of Methuselah, the [son] of Enoch, the [son] of Jared, the [son] of Mahalalel, the [son] of Cainan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the [son] of Enos, the [son] of Seth, the [son] of Adam, the [son] of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
