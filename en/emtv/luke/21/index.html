And what [will be ]the sign when these things are about to happen?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He said: "Take heed that you not be deceived. For many will come in My name, saying, 'I AM,' and, 'The time has drawn near.' Therefore do not go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But whenever you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then He said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful events and great signs from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and they will persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and rulers on account of My name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But it shall turn out for you for a testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Put it then in your hearts not to practice beforehand giving your defense;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries will not be able to contradict nor to withstand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will be betrayed even by parents and relatives, friends and brothers; and they will put [some] of you to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you will be hated by all [people ]for My name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But not a hair of your head shall by any means perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By your patient endurance you shall possess your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has drawn near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the midst of her depart, and let not those who are in the fields enter into her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For these are the days of vengeance, to fulfill all that has been written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing a baby in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath among this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led away captive into all nations. And Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"And there shall be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, as the sea and the waves roar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men's hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of those things which are coming upon the earth, for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now when these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption draws near."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then He spoke to them a parable: "Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When they are already budding, you see and know for yourselves that summer is now near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Assuredly I say to you, this generation shall by no means pass away till all things are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and worries of life, and that Day come upon you unexpectedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For it will come as a snare on all those who live on the face of the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Watch therefore, praying always that you may be counted worthy to escape everything that is about to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple, but at night He went out and stayed on the mountain called Olivet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then early in the morning all the people came to Him in the temple to hear Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
