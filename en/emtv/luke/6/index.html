And His disciples were picking the heads of grain and were eating [them], rubbing them in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Jesus answering them said, "Have you not even read this, what David did when he became hungry, he and those who were with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>how he entered into the house of God, took and ate the showbread, and also gave some to those with him, which is not lawful for any but the priests to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now it happened that on another Sabbath, He entered the synagogue and was teaching. And there was a man there whose right hand was withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the scribes and Pharisees were observing if whether He would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find an accusation against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But He knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, "Arise and stand in the midst."And he arose and stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when He had looked around at them all, He said to him, "Stretch out your hand."And he did so, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they were filled with fury, and they were discussing with one another what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now it came to pass in those days [that] He went out to the mountain to pray, and He was spending the night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it became day, He summoned His disciples, and having chosen twelve from them, whom He also named apostles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>[He chose ]Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Matthew and Thomas; James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Judas the [son] of James, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having come down with them, He stood on a level place, with a crowd of His disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear Him and be healed of their diseases,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>as well as those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were being healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the crowd was trying to touch Him, because power was going out from Him, and was healing [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then He lifted up His eyes toward His disciples, and said: "Blessed [are] you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed [are] you who hunger now, for you shall be filled. Blessed [are] you who weep now, for you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed are you when men shall hate you, and when they shall exclude you, and shall revile [you], and cast out your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice in that day and leap [for joy]! For behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in like manner their fathers did to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"But woe to you who are rich, because you have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you who have been filled, for you shall be hungry. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe [to you] when men speak well of you, for in like manner their fathers would do to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"But I say to you who hear: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless those who curse you; pray for those who mistreat you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes your [outer] garment, do not forbid the tunic either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to everyone who asks of you. And from him who takes away your belongings, do not ask for [them] back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend [to those] from whom you hope to receive [it ]back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners, so that they may receive the same amount back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping to receive nothing back; and your reward shall be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore be compassionate, just as your Father also is compassionate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"And judge not, and you shall not be judged. Condemn not, and you shall not be condemned. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it shall be given to you: good measure, pressed down and shaken and running over they shall give into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it shall be measured back to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He spoke a parable to them: "Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone having been fully trained will be like his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, permit me to remove the speck which is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck which is in your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"For a good tree does not produce rotten fruit, nor does a rotten tree produce good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they gather grapes from a thorn bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"But why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not do [the ]things which I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My words and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood occurred, the stream burst upon that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he who hears and does not do is like a man building a house on the ground without a foundation, [against] which the stream burst upon; and immediately it fell. And the breaking of that house was great."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
