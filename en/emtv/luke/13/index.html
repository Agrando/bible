Cut it down; why does it even waste the ground?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he answered and said to him, 'Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if it produces fruit, [fine]. But if not, in the coming [year,] you can cut it down.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now He was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent over and was not able to straighten herself up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And seeing her, Jesus called her to [Him] and said, "Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He laid His hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and was glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, "There are six days in which one should work; therefore come and be healed on them, and not on the Sabbath day."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord then answered him and said, "Hypocrites! Does not each one of you on the Sabbath loose his ox or donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, these eighteen years, should she not be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when He said these things, all His adversaries were put to shame; and all the crowd was rejoicing over all the glorious things which were done by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then He said, "What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and put in his garden; and it grew and became a large tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again He said, "To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it was all leavened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And He was traveling through various cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then one said to Him, "Lord, are there few who are saved?"And He said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Strive to enter through the narrow gate, because many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When once the Master of the house has risen up and shuts the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open for us,' and answering He will say to you, 'I do not know you, where you are from.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then you will begin to say, 'We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But He will say, 'I tell you I do not know you, where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves being cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they will come from the east and the west, and the north and the south, and will recline [to eat] in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>On that very day some Pharisees came, saying to Him, "Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill You."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And He said to them, "Go and say to that fox, 'Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless I must journey today, tomorrow, and the day following; for it is not possible [for] a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, like a hen [gathers] her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>See! Your house is left to you desolate; and I say to you, you shall by no means see Me until [the time] comes when you say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!'
