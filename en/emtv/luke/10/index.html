Do not move from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And into which ever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And heal the sick there, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>'The very dust from your city which clings to us we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near to you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who hears you hears Me, he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning out of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names have been written in heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And turning to His disciples He said, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and [the one] to whom the Son wills to reveal [Him]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And turning to His disciples He said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see what you see;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and they did not see [them], and to hear what you hear, and they did not hear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read [it]?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he answered and said, "'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,' and 'your neighbor as yourself.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And He said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you shall live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Jesus answered and said: "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and encountered bandits, who after having stripped him of his clothing and having wounded him, departed, leaving [him] half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now by coincidence a certain priest was coming down that road. And when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Likewise a Levite, arriving at the place, came and saw, and passed by on the opposite side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came by him; and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And coming to him, he bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and putting him on his own animal, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave [them] to the innkeeper, and said to him, 'Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition, when I come back, I will repay you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So which of these three does it seem to you proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the bandits?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said, "the [one] who showed mercy to him."Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now it came to pass as they traveled, that He entered into a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the [woman] had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and was listening to His word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she approached Him and said, "Lord, don't You care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But one [thing] is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
