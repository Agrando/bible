And indeed, when I examined Him in your presence, I found no guilt in this Man in the matters which you bring as charges against Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and neither [did] Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore when I have flogged Him, I will release [Him.]"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this [Man], and release to us Barabbas"-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who because of a certain insurrection having occurred in the city had been thrown into prison, and for murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they cried out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he said to them the third [time], "Why, what evil did He do? I have found no guilt deserving death in Him. Therefore when I have flogged Him, I will release [Him]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And their voices and [those] of the chief priests prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Pilate decided [that] their request should be carried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released whom they were requesting, who because of insurrection and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, [as he was] coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might carry it behind Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also were mourning and lamenting Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed [are] the barren, and [the] wombs which did not give birth, and breasts which did not nurse!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they will begin 'to say to the mountains, "Fall on us!"and to the hills, "Cover us!"'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they also were leading two others with Him, evildoers, to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they came to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified Him and the evildoers, one on the right, and one on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."And dividing His garments, they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people stood, observing. And the rulers with them also were sneering, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the elect of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And an inscription also was written over Him, in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew letters: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then one of the evildoers who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, "If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, "Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this Man did nothing wrong."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then he said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when You come in Your kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came upon the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, "Father, 'into Your hands I will commit My spirit.' "And after He said these things, He expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous Man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all the crowds which came together for this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, beat their own chests and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(this [man] had not agreed to their decision and deed), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And having taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth, and put it in a tomb cut out of rock, where no one had ever lain before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>That day was the Preparation; the Sabbath was drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was placed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
