And sitting down, He began to teach the crowds from the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now when He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep and lower your nets for a catch."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Simon answered and said to Him, "Master, we have labored all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will lower the net."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was tearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they beckoned to their partners who were in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For astonishment gripped him and all who were with him at the haul of fish which they had taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And likewise also [it gripped] James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear; from now on you shall be catching men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And having brought the boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass while He was in a certain city, that behold, there was a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, falling on his face he begged Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And reaching out His hand, He touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed."Immediately the leprosy departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He ordered him to tell no one, "But go and show yourself to the priest, and bring an offering for your cleansing, as a testimony to them, just as Moses prescribed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the report about Him spread all the more; and great crowds came together to hear, and to be healed by Him from their sicknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But He Himself would withdraw into the wilderness and would pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now it happened on a certain day that He was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there[,] who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And behold, men [were] carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and to lay [him ]before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, going up on the roof, they lowered him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst in front of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And seeing their faith, He said to him, "Man, your sins have been forgiven you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this [Man ]who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when Jesus perceived their reasonings, He answered and said to them, "Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Arise and walk'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"-He said to the man who was paralyzed, "I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Immediately he rose up before them, taking up [the bed] which he had been lying on, he went off to his own house, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And amazement gripped [them] all, and they were glorifying God, and they were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen extraordinary things today!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And leaving everything, he arose and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Levi made a great banquet for Him in his own house. And there was a great number of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them [to eat.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their scribes and the Pharisees complained against His disciples, saying, "Why do You eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered and said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise also the [disciples] of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He said to them, "Can you make the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then He spoke a parable to them: "No one puts a patch of a new garment on an old one; otherwise both the new [garment] tears, and also the patch that was taken out of the new [garment ]does not match with the old [garment].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the wineskins and it will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But [one] must put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And no one, having drunk old [wine], immediately desires new; for he says, 'The old is better.'
