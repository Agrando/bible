Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Give us day by day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil [one]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He said to them, "Which of you shall have a friend, and go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, lend me three loaves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>for a friend has come to me on his journey, and I have nothing to set before him';</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he will answer from within and say, 'Do not trouble me; the door has already been shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give to you'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say to you, even if he will not get up and give to him, because he is his friend, yet on account of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"So I say to you, ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And which father among you, if his son asks for bread, will he give him a stone? Or [if he asks for] a fish, will he give him a serpent instead of a fish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Or if he asks for an egg, will he give him a scorpion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If you then, being evil, know [how] to give good gifts to your children, by how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. So it was, when the demon came out, that the mute man spoke; and the crowds marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But others, testing [Him,] were seeking from Him a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and a house divided against a house falls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say [that ]I cast out demons by Beelzebub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast [them] out? Therefore they will be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his possessions are in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when someone stronger [than] he comes upon [him,] he overcomes him, [and ]he takes away his full armor in which he had trusted, and distributes his spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through waterless places, seeking rest; and not finding [any], he says, 'I will return to my house from where I came out.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And coming, he finds it swept and adorned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he goes and takes along seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they come and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it happened, while He spoke these things, that a certain woman from the crowd raised [her] voice and said to Him, "Blessed is the womb which bore You, and the breasts which nursed You!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But He said, "More than that, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now as the crowds gathered even more, He began to say, "This generation is evil. It seeks a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The queen of the South shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and shall condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed [one] greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed [one] greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"No one, having lit a lamp, puts it in a secret place or under a basket, but on a lampstand, so that those who come in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light. But when your eye is evil, your body also is dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore take heed that the light which is in you is not darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore if your whole body is full of light, not having any part dark, the whole body will be full of light, as when the bright shining of a lamp gives light to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as He spoke, a certain Pharisee asked that He would eat with him. And having entered, He reclined [to eat].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that He had not first washed before the meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but the inside of you is full of greed and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Fools! Did not He who made the outside also make the inside?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Nevertheless give what is inside as alms; and see, all things are clean to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But woe to you Pharisees! Because you pay a tithe of mint and rue and every vegetable, and you pass over justice and the love of God. These things[ ]you ought to have done, without leaving the others [undone].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Woe to you Pharisees! Because you love the first seat in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you are like unmarked graves, and the men walking over them do not know it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then one of the lawyers answered and said to Him, "Teacher, by saying these things You insult us also."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And He said, "Woe to you lawyers as well! Because you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Woe to you! Because you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Consequently, you bear witness to and approve of the deeds of your fathers; because they indeed killed them, but you build their tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore the wisdom of God also said, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and [some] of them they will kill and persecute,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>so that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the temple. Yes, I say to you, it shall be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Woe to you lawyers! Because you have taken away the key of knowledge. You yourselves did not enter in, and those who were entering in you hindered."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And as He said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be dreadfully hostile, and to cross-examine Him about many things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>lying in wait for Him, and seeking to catch Him in something He might say, so that they might accuse Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
