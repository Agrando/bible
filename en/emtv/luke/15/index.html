So he divided to them his livelihood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And not many days after, having gathered together all things, the younger son went on a journey to a distant country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when he had spent everything, there arose a severe famine throughout that country, and he began to be in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he was longing to fill his stomach with the carob pods which the swine were eating, and no one gave him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But having come to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have an abundance of bread, and I am perishing with hunger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose and went to his father. But when he was still far off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe and put [it] on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And bring the fatted calf here and slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for this my son was dead and came to life, and he was lost and was found.' And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having summoned one of the servants, he was inquiring what these things might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and because he has received him back in good health, your father has killed the fatted calf.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and began to plead with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So he answered and said to his father, 'Lo, so many years I have been serving you and I never transgressed your commandment; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fatted calf for him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But it was necessary to be merry and to rejoice, because your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.'
