Is it not from here, from your lusts, which war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You lust and you do not have. You murder and are jealous and you cannot obtain. You fight and make war. You do not have because you do not ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may spend [it] in [gratifying] your lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse [your] hands, [you] sinners; and purify [your] hearts, [you] double-minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter change into mourning and your joy into dejection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be humbled before the Lord, and He will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not speak evil of one another, brothers. He who speaks evil against a brother and judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. And if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you who judges the other?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, you who say, "Today and tomorrow let us travel to this city, and let us spend a year there, and let us trade and make a profit"-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>[you] who do not know [what will] happen tomorrow. For what is your life? For it will be a vapor that appears for a little [time], but then also disappears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we shall live and do this or that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do [it], to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
