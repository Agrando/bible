Did God not choose the poor of the world [to be] rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He promised to those that love Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you have dishonored the poor. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into court?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do they not blaspheme the noble name by which you are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself,"you do well;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one [point], he has become guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He who said, "Do not commit adultery,"also said, "You shall not murder."Now if you do not commit adultery, but [yet ]you murder, [then ]you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment is without mercy to the one who does not show mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What does it profit, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Is that [kind of] faith able to save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled,"but you do not give them the necessary things of the body, what [is] the benefit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus also that faith, if it does not have works, is dead, [being] by itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But someone will say, "You have faith, and I have works."Show me your faith [apart] from your works, and I will show you my faith by means of my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe God is one. You do well. Even the demons believe-and they shudder!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by means of his works faith was made perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness."And he was called a friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by means of works, when she received the messengers and sent [them] out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
