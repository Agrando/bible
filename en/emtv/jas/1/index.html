So the rich man also shall fade away in his pursuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is the man who endures temptation; because when he is approved, he shall receive the crown of life which the Lord promised to those who love Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But each [one] is tempted by his own lusts, being drawn away and being seduced [by them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then lust, when it conceives, gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Exercising His will He begat us by the word of truth, that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then, my beloved brothers, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the wrath of man does not produce the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore laying aside all filthiness and abundance of evil, in meekness receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But become doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, this [one] is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he observed himself and has gone away, and immediately forgot what sort of [man] he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the [one] who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues [in it], and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one shall be blessed in what he does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceiving his heart, the religion of this [man ]is useless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure and undefiled religion before God and [the] Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
