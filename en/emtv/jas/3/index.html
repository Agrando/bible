If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a mature man, able also to bridle the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Consider that we put bits in horses' mouths that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Consider also the ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the pilot desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so the tongue is a small member and it boasts great things. See how great a forest a little fire kindles!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. Thus the tongue is set among our members, as that which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of both beasts and birds, of both reptiles and sea creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But no man can tame the tongue. [It] is an unrestrainable evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are created according to [the] likeness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth come blessings and curses. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The spring does not pour forth from the same opening [both ]the sweet and the bitter [water, does it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is not possible, my brothers, [for] a fig tree to make olives, or a vine [to make ]figs, [is it]? Thus no spring is able to produce [both] salt and sweet water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is there anyone wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct [that] his works [are] in meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and strife in your heart, do not boast and lie against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, demonic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where jealousy and strife [exist], there unrest and every evil deed [are].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, willing to yield, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those making peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
