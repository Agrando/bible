You stored up treasure in the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Indeed, the wages of the laborers who reaped your fields, which were kept back by you, cry out, and the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You lived luxuriously upon the earth and you lived riotously, you nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have condemned; you have murdered the just[. ]He does not resist you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer awaits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, until it receives the early and late rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You also be patient. Establish your hearts, because the coming of the Lord has drawn near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not murmur against one another, brothers, lest you be judged. Behold, the Judge stands before the doors!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My brothers, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of evil suffering and of longsuffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Indeed we count those blessed who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you saw the end of the Lord-that He is compassionate and He is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But above all, my brothers, do not swear, neither by heaven nor the earth, nor any other oath. But let your "Yes"be "Yes,"and [your] "No,""No,"so that you may not fall into hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Does anyone among you suffer misfortune? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anyone among you sick? Let him call on the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the prayer of faith will save the [one ]who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess your transgressions to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of the righteous is very powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Elijah was a man of similar nature to us, and with a prayer, he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, and it did not rain upon the land for three years and six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Brothers, if anyone among you wanders away from the truth, and anyone turns him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>let him know that he who turns a sinner back from the error of his way will save a soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
