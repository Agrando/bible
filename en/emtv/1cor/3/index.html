Indeed, neither are you now yet able;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal, and walking according to human principles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For when one says, "I am of Paul,"and another, "I [am] of Apollos,"are you not carnal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord has given to each one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gives the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are coworkers with God; you are God's field, you are God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise architect I have laid the foundation, but another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For no other foundation can anyone lay, other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if anyone builds on this foundation [with] gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>each one's work shall be made manifest; for the Day shall reveal it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall test each one's work, as to what sort it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If anyone's work which he has built remains, he shall receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If anyone's work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which [temple] you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their craftiness";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and again, "The LORD knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are useless."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come-all things[ ]are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
