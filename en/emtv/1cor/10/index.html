For they were drinking from that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Nevertheless, with the majority of them God was not pleased, for their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now these things took place as examples for us, in order that we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nor be idolaters, just as some of them; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nor let us commit fornication, just as some of them fornicated, and in one day twenty-three thousand fell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>nor let us tempt Christ, just as also some of them tempted [Him], and were destroyed by serpents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor murmur, just as also some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now all these things happened to those [people] as examples, and they were written for our instruction, to whom the ends of the ages have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, let him who thinks he stands take heed, lest he should fall!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation, He will also make the way out, [so as for] you to be able to bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I speak as to wise men; judge for yourselves what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because we, though many, are one bread and one body; for we all partake from the one bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look at Israel according to the flesh: are not those who eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What am I saying then? That an idol is anything, or what is offered to idols is anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[No], but that the[ ]things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not desire that you should have fellowship with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; you cannot partake of the Lord's table and of the table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things are lawful for me, but not all things are profitable; all things are lawful for me, but not all things edify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no one seek his own concerns, but let each [one] seek another's concern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Eat everything being sold in the meat market, questioning nothing, for conscience' sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for "The earth is the LORD's, and all its fullness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if any of the unbelievers invites you to dinner, and you desire to go, eat whatever is set before you, questioning nothing, for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if anyone says to you, "This was offered to idols,"do not eat it for the sake of the one who told you, and for his conscience' sake; for "The earth is the LORD's, and all its fullness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Conscience,"I say, not your own, but that of the other. For why is my freedom judged by another man's conscience?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if I partake with thanks, why am I defamed for [that] of which I give thanks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Be without offense, both toward Jews and toward Greeks, and toward the church of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>just as I also please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the [profit] of many, that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
