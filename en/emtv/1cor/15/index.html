<a href="/en">English</a> &gt; <a href="/en/emtv">English Majority Text Version</a> &gt; <a href="/en/emtv/1cor">1 Corinthians</a> &gt <strong>Chapter 15</strong></div><p><span class="verse"><a name="1">1</a>Now I made known to you, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>through which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you-unless you believed in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thereafter He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, of whom the majority remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thereafter He appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And last of all, as of [one] born out of due time, He appeared to me also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than them all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, whether it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain and your faith also is vain!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And we are found [to be ]false witnesses of God, because we bore witness concerning God, that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise-if in fact the dead are not raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the dead are not raised, [then] neither has Christ been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are to be pitied above all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, [and] has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since by a man [came] death, also by a Man came the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all will be made alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ at His coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then [will be] the end, when He hands over the kingdom to God, even the Father, when He abolishes every ruler and every authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy that will be abolished is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For "He has subjected all things under His feet."But when He says that "all things have been subjected,"it is evident that [this is] except for Him who subjected all things to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now when all things are made subject to Him, then also the Son Himself will be subjected to Him who subjected all things to Him, in order that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the dead, if the dead are not raised at all? Why are they also baptized for the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why are we also in danger every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I [affirm], by my boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If, in the manner of men, I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what is the benefit to me? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not be deceived: "Evil associations corrupt good habits."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Awake to righteousness, and do not sin! For some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Fool, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what you sow, you do not sow that body that will be, but a bare grain-perhaps wheat or some other [grains].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives to it a body just as He desired, and to each of the seeds its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is a different [kind] [of flesh] for men, and another flesh for beasts, another for fish, and another for birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there[ are ]heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from [another] star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thus also it is written, "The first man Adam [became] a living being;"the last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>However, that which is spiritual is not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man [was ]from earth, made of dust; the second Man is the Lord from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Like the [man] made of dust, so also [are] those who are made of dust; and as is the heavenly [Man], so also [are ]those [who are ]heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And just as we have borne the image of the [man] made of dust, let us also bear the image of the heavenly [Man].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor can corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So when this corruptible should put on incorruption, and this mortal should put on immortality, then will come to pass the word which was written: "Death was swallowed up in victory."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>"O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>So then, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
