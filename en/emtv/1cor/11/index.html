But if it is a shameful [thing ]for a woman to have her hair cut, or to be shaved, let her be covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nor was man created for woman, but woman for the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because of this, the woman ought to have a [symbol] [of] authority on her head, because of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless, neither is the man apart from the woman, nor the woman apart from the man, in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as the woman is from the man, even so the man is by the woman; but all things are of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge among yourselves. Is it proper for a woman to pray to God uncovered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does not nature itself teach you, that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory for her; because her long hair has been given [to her] in place of a covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now in giving these instructions I do not praise you, because you are not coming together for the better, but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For first of all, when you come together in church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must also be sects among you, in order that those who are approved may become recognized among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore when you assemble in the same [place], it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For when you eat, each one takes first his own supper, and one goes hungry and another is drunk!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What? Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God, and disgrace those who do not have? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered unto you: that the Lord Jesus, during the night in which He was betrayed, took bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and having given thanks, He broke it and said, "Take, eat; this is My body which has been broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise He also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until He comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord irreverently will be guilty of the body of the Lord and of the blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man examine himself, and in this way let him eat from the bread and drink from the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he that eats and drinks irreverently eats and drinks judgment to himself, not judging correctly the body of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and many have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we judge ourselves correctly, we would not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, in order that we may not be condemned along with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will put in order when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
