Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of its power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent I will annul."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, God was well pleased, through the foolishness of our preaching, to save those that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, not many noble, [are called].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God chose the foolish things of the world in order that He might humiliate the wise, and God chose the weak things of the world in order that He might humiliate the mighty[.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the lowly things of the world, and the despised things God has chosen, and the things which are not, in order that He might nullify the things which are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so that no man may boast before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But from Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that, as it is written, "He that boasts, let him boast in the LORD."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
