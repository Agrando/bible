And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we will judge angels? Let alone ordinary [matters]!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If then you have ordinary lawsuits, do you appoint those who are disdained within the church [to judge?]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say [this] to your shame. So is there not among you a wise [man], not even one, who will be able to judge between his brother [and another]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Actually then, it is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits against one another. Why not rather accept wrong? Why not rather accept being defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you wrong and defraud, and these things [to your] [own ]brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor covetous, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor abusive people, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you! But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not profitable. All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Foods for the stomach and the stomach for foods, but God will destroy both this [stomach] and these [foods]. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise us up through His power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make [them] members of a harlot? By no means!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that he who is joined to a harlot is one body [with her]? For "the two,"He says, "shall become one flesh."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that is joined with the Lord is one spirit [with Him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you were bought with a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
