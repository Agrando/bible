For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, in order that we might know the things freely given to us by God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>which things we also speak, not in words taught in human wisdom, but in words taught by the Holy Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he that is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned by no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For "Who has known the mind of the LORD, that he may instruct Him?"But we have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
