And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife [does].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do not deprive one another, except by mutual agreement, [and that] for a season, so that you may devote yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I say this as a concession, not as a commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I wish that all men would be as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they should remain as I also [remain];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if they are not exercising self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn [with passion].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now to those who have married I command, yet not I, but the Lord: A wife is not to be separated from her husband-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and even if she does separate, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband-and a husband is not to divorce his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she consents to live with him, let him not divorce her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a wife who has an unbelieving husband, if he consents to live with her, let her not divorce him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbelieving [spouse] separates, let [him or her ]separate; the brother or the sister has not been bound in such cases; but God has called us to peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Otherwise as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I command in all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Were you called as a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you can be made free, rather make use of [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's free [man]. Likewise he who is called as a free [man] is Christ's slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brothers, let each one remain with God in [the state] in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord; but I give judgment, as having received mercy by the Lord to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I consider this to be good because of the present distress, that [it is] good for a man to be as he is:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Have you been released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But even if you should marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin should marry, she has not sinned. But such will have trouble in the flesh, and I would spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brothers, the time has been shortened; so that from now on even those having wives should be as though they had none,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and those weeping as though not weeping, and those rejoicing as though not rejoicing, and those buying as though not possessing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and those using this world as not using it up. For the form of this world is passing away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I want you to be without anxiety. The unmarried man cares about the things of the Lord-[about ]how he may please the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the [man] having married cares about the things of the world-[about ]how he may please his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the wife and the virgin are different. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the woman having married cares about the things of the world-about how she may please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a snare upon you, but for that which is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past her youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he desires. He does not sin; let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But [he] who stands in his heart, not having necessity, but has power over his own desire, and has decided this in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then he who gives her in marriage does well, but he who does not give her in marriage does better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A wife has been bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband also dies, she is free to be married to whom she desires, only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is more blessed if she remains as she is, in my opinion-and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
