Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If I am not an apostle to others, yet indeed I am to you. For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My defense to those who examine me is this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do we not have [the] right to eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do we not have [the] right to take along a wife [who is] a sister, as do also the other apostles, the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or is it only Barnabas and I who must work for a living?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who ever serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink from the milk of the flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do I say these things as a mere man? Or does not the law say these things also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is written in the law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox while it threshes."Is it oxen God is concerned about?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or does He say [this] altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, for it is written, that he that plows should plow in hope, and he that threshes, in hope should partake of his hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we have sown spiritual things for you, [is it] a great thing if we reap your material things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others partake of this right over you, do not we even more? Nevertheless we did not use this right, but bear all things lest we hinder the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do you not know that those who minister the holy things eat from the temple, and those who serve at the altar have a share in the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus also the Lord commanded those who proclaim the gospel to live from the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I used none of these things, nor have I written these things that it should become thus for me; for it is better for me rather to die than that anyone should make my boasting void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if I preach the gospel, there is nothing for me to boast about, for necessity is pressed upon me; yes, woe is me if I do not preach the gospel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a commission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What then is my reward? That when I preach the gospel, I may present the gospel of Christ free of charge, so as not to exploit my rights in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For being free from all [men], I have made myself a servant to all, in order that I might win the more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and to the Jews I became as a Jew, in order that I might win Jews; to those who are under law, as under law, in order that I might win those who are under law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to those outside the law, as [one] outside the law (not being outside the law toward God, but subject to [the ]law toward Christ), in order that I might win those outside the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>to the weak I became as weak, in order that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all [men], that I might by all means save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now this I do for the sake of the gospel, in order that I may become a partaker of it [with you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do you not know that those running in a stadium all run, but one receives the prize? So run, in order that you may win.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And everyone who competes exercises self-control [in] all things. Now they [compete] in order that they may receive a perishable crown, but we [compete] [for ]an imperishable crown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I run thus: not as without a goal, thus I box: not as one beating the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I treat my body roughly, and I bring it into subjection, lest, having preached to others, I myself should become disqualified.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
