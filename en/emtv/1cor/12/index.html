If the whole [were] hearing, where [would be] the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has set the parts, each one of them, in the body just as He desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if all [parts ]were one part, where [would be] the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now indeed there[ are] many parts, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you"; nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But to a greater degree the parts of the body which seem weaker are necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And [the parts] of the body which we consider to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater propriety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But our presentable [parts] have no need. But God united the body, giving greater honor to the [part] being inferior,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>lest there be divisions in the body, but the parts care the same for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one part suffers, all the parts suffer together; or if one part is honored, all the parts rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And [those] whom God has appointed in the church [are]: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>All [are] not apostles, [are they]? All [are] not prophets, [are they]? Are all teachers? [Are] all [workers of] miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But strive for the better gifts. And yet I make known a more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
