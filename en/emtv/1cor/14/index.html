For you will be speaking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are, perhaps, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them without meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the sound, I shall be as a foreigner to the [one ]speaking, and the [one] speaking [shall be] as a foreigner to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that you may abound to the edification of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let he that speaks in an [unknown] tongue pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say "Amen"when you give thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, in order that I may instruct others, rather than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, do not be children in your understanding; rather, in malice be children, but in understanding be men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written: "With men of other tongues and by strange lips I will speak to this people; and yet not even in this way will they hear Me,"says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If then the whole church comes together at the same place, and all speak in tongues, and there come in [those that are] unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an unlearned person comes in, he is reproved by all, he is discerned by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And so the secrets of his heart become clear; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is truly among you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each of you has a song, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If anyone speaks in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be ]by two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let two or three prophets speak, and let others discriminate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if [something] is revealed to another who sits by, let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you can all prophesy [one] by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not [the author] of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>let your women be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but to be in subjection, just as the law also says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or did the word of God go forth from you? Or did it come to you only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or [is] spiritual[,] let him recognize that the things which I am writing to you are the commandments of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, brothers, seek to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done properly and according to order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
