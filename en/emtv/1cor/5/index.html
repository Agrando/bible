Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Purge out the old leaven, in order that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So then let us observe the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I wrote to you in my epistle not to associate with fornicators.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet I certainly did not mean with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to leave this world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But now I have written to you not to associate with anyone named a brother, who is a fornicator, or covetous person, or an idolater, or abusive person, or a drunkard, or a swindler-not even to eat with such a person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But those who are outside God will judge.
