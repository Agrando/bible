And he got up and was baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Now Saul was with the disciples in Damascus three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately in the synagogues he was proclaiming Christ, that He is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all those who heard were astounded, and were saying, "Is this not the one who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might take them having been bound, to the chief priests?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul all the more was growing strong, and was confounding the Jews who were dwelling in Damascus, proving that this [Jesus] is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when many days were fulfilled, the Jews plotted to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But their plot became known to Saul. And they closely watched the [city] gates both day and night, in order that they might kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the disciples, taking him by night, they let him down through the wall, lowering [him ]in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now when Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas, taking hold of him, brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the way, and that He had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he spoke boldly in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and he was speaking and disputing with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they were attempting to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the brothers, learning about it, brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were edified, and going in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, were multiplying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now it came to pass, as Peter went through all [parts of the country], that he went down to the saints who were dwelling in Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he found there a certain man named Aeneas, who had been confined to a bed for eight years,[ ]who was paralyzed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed."Then he arose immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all who were dwelling at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now in Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. This [woman] was full of good works and charitable giving which she was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But it came about in those days that she became ill and died; and they washed her, and put [her] in an upper room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was in Joppa, sent to him, urging him not to delay in coming to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And arising, Peter went with them. When he arrived, they took him into the upper room, and all the widows stood beside him weeping, showing [him ]tunics and cloaks which Dorcas was making, [while ]she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Peter, having put them all outside, knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, arise."And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And giving to her his hand, he raised her up; and when he called the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it became known throughout all of Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he stayed for some time in Joppa with a tanner [named ]Simon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
