For you sit judging me according to the law, and contrary to the law do you command that I should be struck?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But those standing by said, "Do you revile the high priest of God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, 'You shall not speak wickedly of a ruler of your people.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Paul perceived that one part was of the Sadducees and the other of the Pharisees, he cried out in the Sanhedrin, "Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of a Pharisee; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he had spoken this, there came to be a dispute between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection-nor angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came to be a great outcry, and the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, saying, "We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when much dissension developed, the commander, fearing lest Paul might be torn apart by them, commanded the detachment of soldiers to go down and seize him from the midst of them, and to bring [him] into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now on the next night the Lord stood by him and said, "Take courage, Paul; for as you solemnly testified about the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when it was day, some of the Jews joined in a conspiracy and bound themselves by a curse, saying neither would they eat nor drink until they would kill Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there were over four hundred who had made this plot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who came to the chief priests and to the elders and said, "We have bound ourselves by oath with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now you, therefore, together with the council, suggest to the commander that he be brought down to you tomorrow, as though you are going to determine more accurately the things concerning him; but we, before he comes near, are prepared to kill him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Paul's sister's son heard about the ambush, he came and entered into the barracks, and told [this] to Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Paul, summoning one of the centurions and said, "Lead this young man away to the commander, for he has something to tell him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore taking him along, he brought him to the commander and said, "The prisoner Paul, having summoned me, asked me to bring this young man to you, for he has something to say to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the commander, taking him by his hand, withdrew to a private place and inquired, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask that tomorrow you bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin, as though they are going to learn something more accurate concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore you [must] not be persuaded by them; for more than four hundred of them are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves by a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they kill him; and now they are prepared, waiting for the promise from you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the commander dismissed the young man, and commanded him, "Tell no one that you have made known these things to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having summoned two of the centurions he said, "Make ready two hundred soldiers, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, in order that they may go to Caesarea, to leave at the third hour of the night;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and place mounts at [their] disposal, in order that they may put Paul on them, and bring him safely to Felix the governor."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he wrote a letter which contained this content:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man, having been arrested by the Jews, was about to be killed by them. I came upon [them] with the detachment of soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And desiring to know the cause for which they were accusing him, I took him down to their council;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I found that he was accused concerning questions of their law, [but] had no accusation [against him] worthy of death or chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when it became known to me that a plot against the man by the Jews was about to happen, I sent him at once to you, and also commanded the accusers to state the charges against him before you. Farewell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought him during the night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And on the next day they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they entered into Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, [they] also presented Paul to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the governor read the letter, he asked what province he was from. And learning that he was from Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>he said, "I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive."And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's Praetorium.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
