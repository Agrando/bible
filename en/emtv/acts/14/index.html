Why are you doing these things? We men are of the same nature as you, preaching the gospel to you, that you must turn from these useless things to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who in the generations having gone by permitted all the Gentiles to walk in their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good, giving to you rain from heaven and fruit bearing seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And saying these things, they scarcely stopped the crowds from sacrificing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But there arrived from Antioch and Iconium [certain ]Jews, and having persuaded the crowds and having stoned Paul, they dragged [him] outside the city, thinking he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when the disciples encircled him, he stood and entered into the city. And the next day he went out together with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having preached the gospel to that city and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>strengthening the souls of the disciples, urging [them] to continue in the faith, [saying, "]Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having chosen elders for them in every church, [and ]having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having crossed Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they were commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now arriving and gathering the church together, they related all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith for the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they spent a long time there with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
