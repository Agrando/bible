This [same] Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you watched Him go into heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying; both Peter and James and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These were continuing with one mind in prayer and petition, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in those days Peter, rising up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Men, brothers; it was necessary [for] this Scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>'for he was numbered with us and obtained a portion in this ministry.'"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now this man purchased a field by means of the wages of[ his] iniquity,[ ] and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his homestead become desolate, and let no one dwell in it'; and, 'May another take his office of overseer. '</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us in every time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which He was taken up from us, one of these must become a witness with us of His resurrection."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they nominated two: Joseph who is called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed and said, "You, O Lord, knower of all hearts, show whom You have chosen of these two</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to receive a portion in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they cast their lots. And the lot fell on Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
