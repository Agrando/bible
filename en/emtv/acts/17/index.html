When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And these were more noble-minded than[ ]those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all readiness, each day examining the Scriptures [to see ]whether these things might be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore many of them believed, and not a few of the prominent Greek women and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul in Berea, they came there also, agitating the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then immediately the brothers sent Paul away, to go toward the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And those conducting Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy, that as quickly as possible they should come to him, they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in Athens, while Paul waited for them, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was full of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the [Gentile] worshippers, and in the marketplace daily with those coming by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And also some of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. And some were saying, "What does this seed-picker wish to say?"But others [said], "He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,"because he was preaching the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And taking hold of him, they brought [him] to the Areopagus, saying, "Are we able to know what this new doctrine is you speak about?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we desire to know what these things might mean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now all the Athenians and the strangers staying there as visitors spent their time in nothing other than to say or to hear some new thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men, Athenians, according to all things I perceive you as [being ]very religious;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for as I passed by and considered the objects of your worship, I found also an altar on which it had been inscribed: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, [Him] whom being ignorant of you worship, this [One] I announce to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who made the world and all the things in it, Him being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by human hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor by the hands of men is He served, as though He needed anything, for He gives to all life, and breath, with respect to all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, and He ordained their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>[in order for them ]to seek the Lord, if perhaps indeed they might grope for Him and find [Him], and yet being indeed not far from each one of us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also His offspring.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Therefore, being the offspring of God, we ought not to suppose that the Godhead is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and the imagination of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So then these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now He commands all men everywhere to repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because He has appointed a day in which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by [the] Man whom He has appointed, having given proof to all, by raising Him from the dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some were scoffing, but others said, "We will hear you again concerning this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And thus Paul went forth from their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>However, some men were joined to him and believed, among whom were also Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
