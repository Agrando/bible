and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; and they shall prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun shall be changed into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and awesome Day of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man attested by God to you by miracles, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves also know-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you took, and by lawless hands, nailing [Him] to a cross, you killed [Him];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whom God raised, [thus] doing away with the labor pains of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says concerning Him, "I foresaw the Lord always before Me, because He is at My right hand, that I may not be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because You will not abandon my soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have made known to me the ways of life; You will fill me full of joy in Your presence."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Men, brothers, let[ me] speak with boldness to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to seat [Him ]on his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>foreseeing [this], he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, "that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"This Jesus God has raised up, of which we all are witnesses."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Therefore having being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself: `The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now having heard this, they were cut to the heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Men and brothers, what shall we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, "Be saved from this crooked generation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they were continuing in the teaching of the apostles, and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then fear came upon every person, and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now all who believed were together, and they had all things in common,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and they were selling their possessions and goods, and were dividing them among all, to the degree that anyone had a need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were sharing food with joy and simplicity of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to the church daily those who were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
