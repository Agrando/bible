"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he heard these things, Felix adjourned them, knowing more accurately the things[ ]concerning the Way, and said, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And ordering the centurion to keep watch over Paul and to let him have some liberty, and not to forbid [any] of his own to serve or to come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now after some days, when Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment which is going to be, Felix became afraid and answered, "Go away for now; but when I have opportunity I will summon you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore sending for him more often, he was conversing with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But after two years had passed, Felix received Porcius Festus as his successor; and Felix, desiring to grant favors to the Jews, left Paul in prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
