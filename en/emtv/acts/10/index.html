For never did I eat anything common or unclean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a voice [spoke] again the second [time ]to him, "That which God has made clean, you must not make common."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this happened three times, and again the vessel was taken up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now as Peter was very perplexed within himself as to what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius, having found by inquiry the house of Simon, stood at the gateway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now while Peter pondered about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, men are seeking you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Arise therefore, go down and go with them, without wavering; for I have sent them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter, going down to the men, said, "Behold, I am he whom you seek. What is the reason for which you are here?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said, "Cornelius the centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, having a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was given a revelation by a holy angel to send for you to his house, and to hear words from you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore he invited them in and received [them] as guests. Now on the next day Peter went forth with them, and some brothers from Joppa went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And on the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and close friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now when it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, [and] fell at his feet and worshipped [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up; I myself am also a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And talking with him he went in, and found many having gathered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he said to them, "You know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to associate with or to approach a Gentile; and yet God has shown to me that I should call no man common or unclean;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>therefore also without objecting, I came when I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Cornelius said, "From the fourth day until this hour I was fasting, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in shining clothing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms have been remembered before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, whose surname is Peter. He is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, beside the sea. When he arrives, he will speak to you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Therefore immediately I sent to you, and you have done well to come. Now then we are all present before God, to hear all the things having been commanded you by God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter, opening his mouth, said: "In truth I comprehend that God is not One to show partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But in every nation, he that fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The word which God sent to the sons of Israel, preaching the good news of peace through Jesus Christ--He being Lord of all-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>you know, the word coming to be throughout all of Judea, and beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they also killed by hanging on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>This [Jesus] God raised up on the third day, and caused Him to be seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people, but to witnesses, who having been chosen beforehand by God, [even] to us, who ate and drank together with Him after He arose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And He commanded us to proclaim to the people, and to testify solemnly that He is the [One] having been appointed by God [to be] Judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>To Him all the prophets bear witness, [that ]through His name, everyone believing in Him shall receive forgiveness of sins."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And those of the circumcision who believed were astounded, as many as had come with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Surely no one can forbid water, can he, that these should not be baptized who received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay for some days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
