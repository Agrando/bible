But after they had waited for a long time and observed nothing unusual happening to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now in the areas around that place were pieces of land [belonging] to the leading citizen of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us, and received us hospitably as guests for three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery, to whom Paul came in and prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then after this happened, also the rest who were ill on the island were coming to him and were being healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who also honored us with many honors, and when we put to sea, they gave us the things that we needed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now after three months we put to sea in a ship that had wintered on the island, [belonging] to Alexandria, with the figurehead of the Twin Brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And putting in to harbor at Syracuse, we stayed there three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>from where having sailed around we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day arose a south wind, on the second day we came to Puteoli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>where having found brothers, we were urged by them to stay for seven days; and so we came to Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from there the brothers, when they heard about our circumstances, they came to meet with us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns, whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God and took courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now when we came to Rome, the centurion handed over the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass after three days that Paul called together those who were prominent among the Jews; and when they had come together, he said to them: "Men, brothers, though I have done nothing against the people or the customs of our forefathers, yet I was handed over as a prisoner from Jerusalem, into the hands of the Romans,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who, when they had examined me, were wanting to release me because there was no cause for my case.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when the Jews spoke in opposition, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore for this reason I have requested you, to see and to speak to you, for because of the hope of Israel I am wearing this chain."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who arrived report or speak anything evil about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we request to hear from you the[ ]things which you think; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having appointed for him a day, many came to him at his house, to whom he was explaining and solemnly testifying to the kingdom of God, and persuading them of the things concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning till evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some were persuaded by the things being said, but others refused to believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And being in disagreement with one another, they went away after Paul had said one word: "The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>saying, 'Go to this people and say: "Hearing you will hear, and by no means understand; and seeing you shall see, and by no means perceive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the hearts of this people has become dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and they should hear with their ears, lest they should understand with their heart and turn back, so that I should heal them."'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he had said these things, the Jews went away, having a great dispute among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Paul remained two full years in his own rented house, and he was receiving all those who were coming to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
