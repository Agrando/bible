Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and denied Him in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked that a murderer be released to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And on the basis of faith in His name, this [one ]whom you observe and know, was made strong by His name. And the faith, which is by Him, has given to him this wholeness before you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as your rulers did also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But those things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Repent therefore and turn back, that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and that He may send He who had been ordained to be your Messiah, Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whom[ ]heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Moses said to the fathers, 'The LORD our God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He says to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>'And it shall be that every person who does not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and his successors, as many as have spoken, have proclaimed these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'And in your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To you first, God, having raised up His Servant Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
