And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But because they saw standing with them the man who had been healed, they had nothing to say against [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they commanded them to go away outside the council, and began to confer among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, "What shall we do to these men? For indeed, that a known sign has come to pass by them is evident to all those who are dwelling in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But lest it be spread further among the people, let us threaten them with a threat, to speak no longer in this name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And summoning them, they commanded them not to speak at all nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered them and said, "Whether it is right before God to hear you rather than God, you judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For we can do none other but to speak the things which we saw and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So having threatened them further, they released them, finding no way of punishing them, on account of the people, because they all were glorifying God over that which had occurred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man was over forty, on whom had come about this sign of healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being released, they came to their own, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one mind and said: "Lord, You are God, who made heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who by the mouth of Your servant David have said: 'Why did the nations rage, and the people conspired vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers were assembled together against the LORD and against His Christ.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"For truly they were assembled against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do all that Your hand and Your counsel foreordained to come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>by extending Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may come about through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things belonging to him was his own, but they had all things in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power the apostles were giving forth their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nor was there anyone needy among them; for all who were owners of lands or houses were selling them, and were bringing the proceeds of the things which had been sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and were placing them beside the feet of the apostles; and they were distributing to each, to the degree that anyone had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joses, who was also named Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a Cyprian by nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>who, possessing a field, sold it and brought the money and placed it beside the feet of the apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
