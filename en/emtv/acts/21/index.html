They said to Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But when it came about that we had completed the days [there], having gone out we departed, all [of them] accompanying us, together with [their ]wives and children, until [we were] outside the city. And having bowed [our] knees on the shore, we prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And having greeted one another, we went up into the ship, and they returned to their own [homes].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And completing our voyage from Tyre, we arrived in Ptolemais, and having greeted the brothers, we stayed one day with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On the next day those accompanying Paul went forth and came to Caesarea, and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while we remained there several days, a certain prophet from Judea named Agabus came down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And coming to us and taking Paul's belt, and binding his feet and hands, he said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, ' The man whose belt this is, the Jews will bind in this way in Jerusalem, and they will deliver [him] into the hands of the Gentiles.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when we heard these things, both we and the local residents urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Paul answered, "Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he remained unpersuaded, we were silent and said, "Let the will of the Lord be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now after those days, having prepared, we went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them a certain Cypriot named Mnason, a long-standing disciple, with whom we would stay as a guest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers gladly received us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On the next day Paul was going in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And having greeted them, he reported one by one those[ ]things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And hearing this, they were glorifying the Lord, saying to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they have been informed about you, that you are teaching defection from Moses, to all the Jews who are among the Gentiles, saying for them not to circumcise their children nor to walk in our customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What then? It is necessary for an assembly to come together; for they will hear that you have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore do this, which we say to you: There[ ]are four men with us who have taken a vow upon themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Take them and purify yourself with them, and pay for them that they may have their head shaved, and that all may know that those things of which they have been informed about you are nothing, but [that] you are agreeing with and keeping the law yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as for the Gentile believers, we wrote, having judged that they should keep no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, from blood, and [from anything] strangled, and from fornication."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul, having taken the men, on the next day having been purified with them, entered into the temple, [thus] giving notice to the completion of the days of the purification, until [the time] when the offering was offered in behalf of each one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, were stirring up all the crowd and put their hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>crying out, "Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who is teaching all [people] everywhere against the people and the Law and this place; and furthermore he has brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the city was aroused; and there was a mob forming among the people, and taking hold of Paul they were dragging him outside the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And seeking to kill him, a report went up to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem had been stirred up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who immediately having taken along soldiers and centurions, ran down among them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the commander, approaching, took hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and he was inquiring who he might be and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But others among the crowd were crying out one thing and some another; and because he was unable to ascertain the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But when he arrived at the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the multitude of the people was following, calling out, "take him away!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, "Is it permitted from me to speak to you?"And he said, "Do you know Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Are you not then the Egyptian who rose up before these days, and led forth the four thousand men of the assassins into the wilderness?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, "I am a Jew from Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city; and I request of you, permit me to speak to the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And permitting him, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
