For nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"But the voice answered me a second [time] from heaven, 'What God has made clean, you must not make common.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"And this was done three times, and again all things[ ]were drawn up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, immediately three men stood before the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Spirit said to me to go with them, without wavering. Now these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the house of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he related to us how he had seen the angel in his house, standing and saying to him, 'Send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>'who will speak words to you by which you and all your household shall be saved.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"And when I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as also on us in the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 'John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"If then God has given to them the same gift as He gave to us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And hearing these things, they remained silent, and [they] glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted even to the Gentiles repentance unto life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then those who were scattered because of the tribulation coming about over Stephen, went about as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, entering into Antioch spoke to the Greek speaking Jews, preaching the good news of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed,[ ]and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the word about them was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas to go as far as Antioch;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who, arriving and seeing the grace of God, was glad, and encouraged them all with purpose of heart to continue with the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus to seek out Saul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came about that for a whole year they assembled with the church and instructed many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And rising up, one of them named Agabus, foretold by the Spirit of a great famine about to happen in all the world, which also came to pass in the time of Claudius Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined as a ministry to send relief to the brothers dwelling in Judea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
