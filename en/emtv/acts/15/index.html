and they were causing great joy to all the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And having come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they declared all that God had done with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But some of those from the sect of the Pharisees rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the apostles and elders gathered together to see about this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after much dispute, Peter arose and said to them: "Men, brothers, you know that from early days God chose among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as also [He did] to us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But through the grace of the Lord Jesus, we believe that we will be saved in the same manner as they."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all the multitude stopped speaking and listened to Barnabas and Paul telling as many signs and wonders as God had done among the Gentiles through them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now after they had finished speaking, James answered, saying, "Men and brothers, listen to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simeon has declared how God first visited [them ]to take from the Gentiles a people for His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"After this I will return, and I will build again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen; and its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>in order that the rest of men may seek out the LORD, and all the Gentiles who are called by My name, says the LORD who does all these things.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Known from everlasting to God are all His works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore I judge that we must not cause trouble for those who are turning to God from [among] the Gentiles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and [from] blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"For Moses has had from ancient generations those who proclaim him in each city, being read in the synagogues from one Sabbath to another."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it seemed best to the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, to send men being chosen from them to Antioch, together with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Writing by their hand these things: The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia who are of the Gentiles: Greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Inasmuch as we have heard that some went out from among us and troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, 'that you must be circumcised and keep the law'-to whom we gave no [such] command-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it seemed best to us, having come to be of the same mind, to send men being chosen to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men having given over their lives for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things by word [of mouth].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to put on you no greater burden except for these necessary things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that you abstain from meat offered to idols, and from blood, and from [anything] strangled, and from fornication; from which keeping yourselves back, you will do well. Farewell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then having been dismissed, they came to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when time had passed, they were dismissed with peace from the brothers to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>- - -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Paul and Barnabas spent time in Antioch, teaching and preaching the good news of the word of the Lord, with many others also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return now and visit our brothers in each city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Barnabas desired to take along with them John called Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul considered it fitting not to take along with them the one who withdrew from them in Pamphylia, and who had not gone together with them to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore a sharp disagreement arose so that they were separated from one another. And Barnabas, taking along Mark, sailed to Cyprus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Paul, choosing Silas, departed, being given over to the grace of God by the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
