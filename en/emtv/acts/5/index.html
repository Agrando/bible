And after it was sold, was it not in your control? Why have you purposed this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. And great fear came upon all those who heard of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young men rose up and covered him up, carried him out, and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it happened about three hours later, that his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Peter said to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?"She said, "Yes, for so much."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Peter said to her, "Why is it that it was agreed by you to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out [as well]."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then immediately she fell down beside his feet and died. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her out, buried her with her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear came to be on all the church and upon all those who were hearing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now by the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders took place among the people. And they were all with one mind in Solomon's Porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But none of the rest dared join them, but the people were magnifying them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And more than ever, believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that they were bringing the sick[ ]and placing them on couches and pallets, so that as Peter was passing by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And also the multitude from the surrounding cities were coming together into Jerusalem, bringing the[ ]sick and those[ ]who were tormented by unclean spirits, who were all being healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the public custody.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But an angel of the Lord during the night opened the doors of the prison, and leading them out, he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they heard that, they entered the temple about daybreak and were teaching. Now when the high priest and those with him arrived, they called together the council, even all the elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison for them to be brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the attendants arrived, and did not find them in the jail, they returned and announced,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>saying, "Indeed we found the prison shut in all security, and the guards standing before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one [inside]!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when they heard these words, both the high priest and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests, they were greatly perplexed about them, as to what would come of this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So one came and reported to them, [saying], "Behold, the men whom you put in jail are standing in the temple and teaching the people!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they were afraid of the people, lest they be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they brought them, and set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, "Did we not give you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to bring on us the blood of this Man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter and the apostles answered, and said: "We must obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you murdered by hanging upon a cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Him God has exalted to His right hand as Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we are His witnesses of these words, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when they heard this, they were infuriated and were resolving to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then someone in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a short time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them: "Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves to these men, as to what you are about to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For before these days, Theudas rose up, claiming himself to be someone, to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this arose Judas the Galilean, in the days of the census, and caused considerable number of people after him to revolt. He too perished, and as many as were persuaded by him were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if the counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it-lest you even be found fighting against God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they were persuaded by him, and when they called the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing because they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And daily in the temple, and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and proclaiming the gospel of Jesus the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
