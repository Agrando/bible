From now on I will go to the Gentiles."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And having gone over from there, he went into the house of a certain [man] named Justus, who worshipped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing, were believing and were being baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the Lord spoke to Paul by a vision in the night, [saying], "Do not fear, but speak, and do not keep silent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he settled [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one purpose rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, "This [man] persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If then it was some misdeed or wicked crime, O Jews, according to reason I would bear with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if it is a question about a word and names and your own law, see [to it] yourselves; for I do not wish to be a judge of these things."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them away from the judgment seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then all the Greeks, taking hold of Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, were beating him before the judgment seat. And none of these things was a concern to Gallio.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Paul still remained there a good while, then bid farewell to the brothers, and sailed away for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He had his hair cut off in Cenchrea, for he had taken a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he arrived in Ephesus, and he left those [two] there; but he, having entered into the synagogue, reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they asked him to remain with them for a longer time, he did not consent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but bid farewell to them saying, "I must by all means keep this coming feast which is in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing."And he put out to sea from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having gone down to Caesarea, and having gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After having spent some time there, he went out, going through in order the Galatian region and the Phrygian [region], strengthening all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, had arrived in Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things about the Lord, although he knew only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he desired to go across to Achaia, having urged him on, the brothers wrote to the disciples [there] to receive him; and when he arrived, he assisted greatly with those who had believed through grace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for he was powerfully refuting the Jews publicly, demonstrating by the Scriptures [that] Jesus was the Messiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
