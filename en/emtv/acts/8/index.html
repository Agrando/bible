And in that day there arose a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And godly men buried Stephen, and they mourned deeply for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul was doing injury to the church, going in from house to house, and dragging away both men and women, and putting them in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore those who were scattered went about preaching the good news of the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, was preaching to them the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the crowds with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the signs which he was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For many of those having unclean spirits [had ]cried out with a loud voice, [and the spirits ]came out; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now a certain man named Simon was previously in the city practicing magic and astounding the people of Samaria, claiming himself to be someone great,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to whom they gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the great power of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they gave heed to him because of the long time that he had astonished them with the magic arts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Simon himself also believed; and having been baptized, he was continuing with Philip, and observing miracles and signs occurring, he was astounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who, coming down, prayed concerning them in order that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For He had not yet fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid hands upon them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Simon observed that by the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, "Give me this power also, that on whom ever I lay my hands he may receive the Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, "Your money perish with you, because you thought to acquire the gift of God through money!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have neither part nor portion in this word, for your heart is not right before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore from this your wickedness, and make petition to God, if perhaps the intent of your heart will be forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of unrighteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Simon answered and said, "Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then solemnly bearing witness to and speaking the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many Samaritan villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Get up and go toward the south on the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza."This is desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he got up and went; and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, a court official of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem worshipping,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he was returning. And sitting upon his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Phillip, running up to it, heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, "How can I, unless someone helps me?"And he urged Philip to come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the portion of the Scripture which he was reading was this: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, thus He opened not His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In His humiliation His justice was taken away, and who will recount His generation? For His life is taken away from the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So the eunuch answered Philip and said, "Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this; of himself, or of someone else?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached the good news [about] Jesus to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now as they were going down the road, they came upon some water. And the eunuch said, "Behold, [here is] water: what prevents me from being baptized?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>- - -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, both Phillip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip, and the eunuch did not see him any longer; and he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found at Azotus. And as he passed through, he preached the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
