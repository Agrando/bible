They also had John as their assistant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And going across the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) resisted them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul, who also is [called] Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and gazing intently at him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[he ]said, "O full of all guile and all craft, [you] son of [the] devil, [you] enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season."And immediately a mistiness and darkness fell upon him, and going about, he sought someone to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then when the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Paul and his companions put to sea from Paphos, and came to Perga of Pamphylia; But John deserted them and returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But they went from Perga, and arrived in Antioch of Pisidia, and entering into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent to them, saying, "Men and brothers, if there is by you a word of encouragement for the people, speak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Paul, arising and motioning with his hand, said, "Men, Israelites, and you who fear God, listen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people chose our fathers, and lifting up the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm brought them out from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now for a time of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave their land to them as an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after these things, [for ]about four hundred and fifty years, He gave [them] judges until [the time of] Samuel the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And removing him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom He also said bearing witness, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, [to be ]a man after My [own] heart, who will do all My will.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>God, from the seed of this [man,] according to the promise, has brought to Israel salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>after John had first proclaimed before His coming, the baptism of repentance to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now as John was finishing his course, he said, 'Whom do you suppose me to be? I am not He. But behold, there comes One after me, the sandal of whose feet I am not worthy to loosen.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the message of this salvation has been sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For those dwelling in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor the voices of the Prophets which are read according to each Sabbath, condemning [him], they fulfilled [the Scriptures.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And finding no cause for death, they asked Pilate that He be executed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they finished all the things having been written about Him, taking Him down from the tree, they put [Him] in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised Him from the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>who appeared for [many] days more to those going up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we proclaim to you the good news of the promise which was made to the fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>that God has fulfilled this promise for us to their children, when He raised up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm: 'You are My Son, today I have begotten You.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"And that He raised Him from the dead, no longer being about to return to corruption, thus He has said: 'I will give you the sure decrees of God concerning David.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Therefore also in another [Psalm] He says, 'You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"For David indeed in his own generation, having served by the purpose of God, died, and was buried with his fathers, and saw corruption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but He whom God raised up did not see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through this Man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and from all[ ]things[ ]from which you could not (by the Law of Moses) be justified, by Him everyone that believes is justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Watch therefore, lest there come upon you that which was spoken of in the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"Behold, you despisers, and marvel and perish! For I will work a work in your days which you will by no means believe, though one were to declare it to you.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Now as the Jews were going out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when the synagogue service was broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking [to them], persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>On the coming Sabbath, almost all the city was assembled to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the Jews, seeing the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and spoke against the things being said by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But Paul and Barnabas, speaking boldly said, "It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first; but since you thrust it away, and judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life; behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so the Lord has commanded us: 'I have set you to be a light of the nations, that you should be for salvation to the end of the earth.' "</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews incited the devout and prominent women and the leading [men] of the city, and raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out from their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But shaking off the dust from their feet against them, they went to Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
