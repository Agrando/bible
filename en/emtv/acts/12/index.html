And he said to him, "Put on your cloak and follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And going out, he was following him, and did not know that the thing taking place by the angel was true, but he was thinking that he was seeing a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And going though the first and the second guard [posts], they came to the iron gate which leads into the city, which was opened to them of its own accord; and going out, they went forward one street, and immediately the angel withdrew from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Peter, having come to himself, said, "Now I know truly that the Lord has sent forth His angel, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jews."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And realizing [this], he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where a considerable [number] were gathered together and were praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a servant girl came to answer, named Rhoda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When she recognized Peter's voice, because of her gladness she did not open the gate, but running in, she announced that Peter stood at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they said to her, "You are mad!"Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, "It is his angel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter was continuing knocking; and opening [the door] they saw him, and were astounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he related to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, "Tell these things to James and to the brothers."And going out, he went to another place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, as to what had become of Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Herod, seeking for him and not finding him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they be executed. And going down from Judea to Caesarea, he was spending time [there].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one purpose they came to him, and persuading Blastus, the one over the king's bedroom, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king's [country].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And on an appointed day Herod, clothing himself with royal apparel, and sitting on the judgment seat, was delivering an address to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the crowds kept calling out, "[This is the] voice of a god and not of a man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the word of God increased and multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, having fulfilled their ministry, taking along with [them] John also, whose surname was Mark.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
