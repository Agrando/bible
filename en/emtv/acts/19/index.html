And finding some disciples</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>[he] said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit, having believed?"So they said to him, "We have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to them, "Into what then were you baptized?"So they said, "Into John's baptism."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Paul said, "John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the One coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when they heard [this], they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now all the men were about twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he entered into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, debating and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some became hardened and disbelieving, speaking evil against the Way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples, each day debating in the school of a certain Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now this took place for two years, so that all who were dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin were brought to those who were sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then some of the wandering Jews, exorcists, attempted to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having the evil spirits, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, doing this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the evil spirit answered and said, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize; but who are you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped upon them, and having subdued them, prevailed against them, so that they ran out of the house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now this became known to all both Jews and Greeks who were dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and they were praising the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And many of those who had believed were coming, confessing and disclosing their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And many of those who were practicing magic brought together their books and burned them up before everyone. And they counted up the prices of them, and [found it to be] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus the word of the Lord was growing powerfully and prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When these things were fulfilled, Paul resolved in his spirit, having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having sent to Macedonia two of those who were ministering to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed on for a time in Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there arose during that time a serious disturbance concerning the Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, providing no little trade [for] the craftsmen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom he gathered, with the workers of similar occupation, and said: "Men, you know out of this trade is our prosperity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you observe and hear that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great multitude, saying that they are not gods which are made by human hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And not only is this business of ours in danger to come into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be despised and also her magnificence, about to be destroyed, she whom all Asia and the world worship."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And hearing [this], and becoming full of anger, they were crying out saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one purpose into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now when Paul wished to enter in among the crowd, the disciples would not permit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And also some of the officials of Asia, being friends with him, sent word to him and urged him not to present himself in the theater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then others were calling out something different, for the assembly was confused, and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And from the crowd they brought forward Alexander, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and desired to make a defense to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But recognizing he was a Jew, there arose one voice from [them ]all, calling out for two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And having quieted the crowd, the city clerk said: "Men of Ephesus, for what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the [image ]fallen from heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore, since these things are undeniable, it is necessary for you to be quieted and to do nothing rash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For you brought these men, neither temple thieves nor blasphemers of your goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a word against anyone, the courts are in session, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if you are wanting to know anything about other [matters], it shall be determined by the lawful assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For we also are in danger of being accused of insurrection concerning today, there being no cause for which we will be able to give, [as ]an explanation for this commotion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
