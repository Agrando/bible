We might have acted with authority, as Apostles of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but we were gentle among you, as a nurse cherishes her children-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>so, having a strong affection for you, we were well pleased to have imparted to you, not only the gospel of God, but our own souls, also; because you were become dear to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For your remember, brethren, our labor and toil; that laboring night and day; that we might not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You were witnesses, and God, also, in what a holy, and just, and blameless manner, we acted toward you that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As, also, you know, how we addressed every one of you as a father his own children, exhorting and comforting you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and testifying that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom of glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On this account, also, we give thanks to God, without ceasing, that when you received from us this message of God, you embraced not the word of men; but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which, indeed, works effectually in you who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For you, brethren, became imitators of the congregations of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus; because you also have suffered like things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who both killed the Lord, and the prophets, and have greatly persecuted us, and do not please God, and are contrary to all men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>hindering us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved; so that they fill up their iniquities always: but the wrath of God is coming upon them at length.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, we, brethren, being separated from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, the more abundantly endeavored, with great desire, to see your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore, we would have come to you (even I, Paul,) once and again, but the adversary hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, at his coming?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You, indeed, are our glory and our joy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
