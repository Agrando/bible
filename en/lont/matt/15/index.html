Thus, by your tradition, you annul the commandment of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hypocrites, well do you suit the character which Isaiah gave of you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>«This people honor me with their lips. though their heart is estranged from me.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>«But in vain they worship me, while they teach institutions merely human.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then, having called the multitude, he said to them, Hear, and be instructed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is not what goes into the mouth pollutes the man; but it is what proceeds out of the mouth, that pollutes the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On which his disciples accosting him, said, Did you observe how the Pharisees, when they heard that saying were offended?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He answered, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be extirpated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Peter addressing him, said, Explain to us that parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered, Are you also void of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not apprehend, that whatever enters the mouth passes into the stomach, and is thrown out into the sink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But that which proceeds out of the mouth, issues from the heart, and so pollutes the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart proceed malicious contrivances, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, calumnies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things which pollute the man; but to eat with unwashed hands pollutes not the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus withdrew into the confines of Tyre and Sidon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and behold! a Canaanitish woman of these territories came to him, crying, Master, Son of David, have pity on me; my daughter is grievously afflicted by a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he gave her no answer. Then his disciples interposed, and entreated him, saying, Dismiss her, for she clamors after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He answering said, My mission is only to the lost sheep of the stock of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>She, nevertheless, advanced, and prostrating herself before him, said, O Lord, help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He replied, It is not seemly to take the children's bread, and throw it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>True, Sir, returned she. Yet even the dogs are allowed the crumbs which fall from their master's table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus, answering, said to her, O woman! great is your faith. Be it to you as you desire. And that instant her daughter was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus having left that place, came nigh to the sea of Galilee, and repaired to a mountain, where he sat down;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and great multitudes flocked to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the dumb, the cripple, and several others, whom they laid at his feet; and he healed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>insomuch that the people beheld, with admiration, the dumb speaking, the cripple sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus called to him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude because they have now attended me three days, and have nothing to eat; I will not dismiss them fasting, lest they faint by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>His disciples answered, Whence can we get bread enough, in the solitude, to satisfy such a crowd?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He asked them, How many loaves have you? They said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then commanding the people to recline upon the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>he took the seven loaves and the fishes, which, having given thanks, he divided and gave to his disciples, who distributed them among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When all had eat, and were satisfied, they carried off seven hand-baskets full of the fragments that remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now they that had eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then having dismissed the multitude, he embarked, and sailed to the coast of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
