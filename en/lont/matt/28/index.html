Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly, say to his disciples, He is risen from the dead; behold he goes before you to Galilee, where you shall see him. Take notice: I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Instantly they went from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to inform his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they were gone, Jesus himself met them, saying, Rejoice. Upon which they prostrated themselves before him, and embraced his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them, Be not afraid: go, tell my brethren to repair to Galilee, and there they shall see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were no sooner gone, than some of the guard went into the city, and informed the chief priests of all that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>These, after meeting and consulting with the elders, gave a large sum to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>with this injunction: Say, his disciples came by night, and stole him while we were asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this come to the procurator's ears, we will appease him, and indemnify you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money, and acted agreeably with to their instructions. Accordingly this report is current among the Jews to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain, whither Jesus had appointed them to repair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw him, they threw themselves prostrate before him; yet some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus came near, and said to them, All authority is given to me in heaven and upon the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>go, convert all the nations, immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe all the things which I have commanded you: and behold, I am with you always, even to the conclusion of this state.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
