Jesus perceiving their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, take courage, your sins are forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>On which some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus knowing their sentiments, said, Why do you harbor evil thoughts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Which is easier-to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, with effect -Arise and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon the earth to forgive sins; Arise, then, (said he to the paralytic,) take up your bed and go home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Accordingly he arose, and went home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the people saw and wondered, glorifying God, who had given such power to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As Jesus departed thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the toll office; to whom he said, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Afterward Jesus being at table in a house, many publicans and sinners came, and placed themselves with him and his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Some of the Pharisees observing this, said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus hearing them, answered, The whole need not a physician, but the sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>«Go, therefore, and learn what this means,» 'I desire humanity, and not sacrifice:' 'for I came to call, not the righteous, but sinners.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then John's disciples addressing him, said, We and the Pharisees often fast: why do your disciples never fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus answered, Can the bridesmen mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the time will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No person mends an old garment with undressed cloth; else the patch itself tears the garment, and makes a greater rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither do people put new wine into old leather bottles; otherwise the bottles burst: and thus, both the wine is spilt, and the bottles are rendered useless. But they put new wine into new bottles, and bother are preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was speaking, a ruler came, and prostrating himself, said, My daughter is by this time dead; but come, and lay your hand upon her, and she will revive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus arose, and, as he followed him, with his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>a woman, who had been twelve years afflicted with a bloody issue, coming behind, touched the tuft of his mantle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for she said within herself, If I but touch his mantle, I shall recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus turning about, saw her, and said, Daughter, take courage, your faith has cured you. And the woman was well from that instant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Being come into the ruler's house, and seeing the players on the flute, with the crowd, making a bustle,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>he said to them, Withdraw, for the young woman is not dead, but asleep. And they derided him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but when the people were put out, he entered, and having taken her by the hand, the young woman arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the fame of this action spread through all the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, Son of David, have pity upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Being come into the house, the blind men approached him: and Jesus said to them, Do you believe I can do this? They answered, Yes, Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he touched their eyes, saying, Be it to you according to your faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Immediately their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charging them, said, Take care that no person know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But being departed, they spread his fame through all that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They were scarcely gone, when a dumb demoniac was presented to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The demon being expelled, the dumb spoke, and the people wondered, saying, Nothing like this was ever seen in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees said, He expels the demons by the prince of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad tidings of the Reign, and curing every disease and every malady.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But when he saw the multitudes, he had compassion upon them, because they were scattered and exposed, like a flock without a shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he said to his disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the reapers are few:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>entreat, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he would send laborers to reap it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
