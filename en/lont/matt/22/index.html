And he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king said to the attendants, Bind him hand and foot, and thrust him out into darkness, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for there are many called, but few chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees retired, and having consulted how they might entrap him in his words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>sent to him some of their disciples, and some Herodians, who being instructed by them, said, Rabbi, we know that you are sincere, and faithfully teach the way of God, without partiality, for you respect not the person of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us, therefore, your opinion: Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus, perceiving their malice, said, Dissemblers, why would you entangle me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me the tribute money. And they reached him a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He asked them, Whose image and inscription is this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They answered, Cesar's. He replied, Render, then, to Cesar that which is Cesar's, and to God that which is God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And admiring his answer, they left him, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The same day Sadducees, who say that there is no future life, came to him and addressed him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Rabbi, Moses has said, if one die, and have no children, his brother shall marry his widow, and raise issue to the deceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there lived among us seven brothers; the eldest married and died without issue, leaving his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus also the second, and the third, and so to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now, at the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven; for they all married her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answering, said to them, You err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for in that state, they neither marry, nor give in marriage: they resemble the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But as to the revival of the dead, have you not read what God declared to you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>«I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?» 'God is not a God of the dead, but of the living.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now, the people who heard this, were struck with awe at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Meantime, the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, flocked about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then, one of them, a lawyer, trying him, proposed this question,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Rabbi, which is the greatest commandment in the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>«Jesus answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the first and greatest commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>«The second is like it,'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets depend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, What do you think of the Messiah? Who son should he be? They answered, David's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He replied, How then does David, speaking by inspiration, call him his Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>«The Lord,» 'says he, '«said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your foes your footstool.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If the Messiah were David's son, would David call him his Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>To this none of them could answer; and from that day no person presumed to interrogate him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
