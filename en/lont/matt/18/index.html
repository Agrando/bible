Snares indeed there must be; nevertheless, alas for the ensnarer!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Wherefore, if your hand or foot ensnare you, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter lame or maimed into life, than having two hands or feet to be cast into the everlasting fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if your eye ensnare you, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter one-eyed into life, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Beware of contemning any of these little ones; for I assure you, that in heaven, their angels continually behold the face of my heavenly Father:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the Son of Man is come to recover the lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>What think you? If a man have a hundred sheep, and one of them has strayed, will he not leave the ninety-nine upon the mountains, and go in quest of the stray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he happens to find it, indeed, I say to you, he derives greater joy from it, than from the ninety-nine which went not astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus it is not the will of your Father in heaven, that any of these little ones should be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wherefore, if your brother trespass against you, go and expostulate with him, when you and he are alone together. If he hear you, you have gained your brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but if he will not hear, take one or two along with you, that by the testimony of two or three witnesses everything may be ascertained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he despises them, tell the congregation; and if he despise the congregation also, let him be to you as a pagan or a publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Indeed, I say to you, whatsoever you shall bind on the earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, I say to you, whatever two of you upon the earth shall agree to ask, shall be granted them by my Father, who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For wherever two or three are assembled in my name, I am in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter approaching, said to him, Master, if my brother repeatedly trespass against me, how often must I forgive him? must I seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus answered, I say to you, not seven times, but seventy times seven times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In this the Administration of Heaven resembles a king, who determined to settle accounts with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Having begun to reckon, one was brought, who owed him ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But that servant not having the means to pay; his master, to obtain payment, commanded that he, and his wife and children, and all that he had should be sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the servant, throwing himself prostrate before his master, cried, Have patience with me, my lord, and I will pay the whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And his master had compassion upon him, and dismissed him, remitting the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But this servant, as he went out, meeting one of his fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred denarii, seized him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His fellow-servant, falling down, besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he would not, but instantly caused him to be imprisoned, until he should discharge the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>His fellow-servants seeing this, were deeply affected, and went, and informed their master of all that had passed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his master, having given orders to call him, said to him, You wicked servant: all that debt I forgave you, because you besought me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Ought not you to have shown such pity to your fellow-servant, as I showed to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So his master, being provoked, delivered him to the jailors, to remain in their hands until he should clear the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus will my heavenly Father treat every one of you, who forgives not, from his heart, his brother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
