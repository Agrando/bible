Indeed, I say to you, they have received their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But you, when you give alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that your alms may be in secret; and your Father, to whom nothing is secret, will himself recompense you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when you pray, be not like the hypocrites, who affect to pray standing in the assemblies, and at the corners of the streets, that men may observe them. Indeed, I say to you, they have received their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you, when you would pray, retire to your closet; and having shut the door, pray to your Father; and your Father, to whom, though he is unseen himself, nothing is secret, will recompense you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in prayer, use not a multiplicity of words as the Pagans do, who think that using many words will gain them acceptance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Imitate them not; for your Father knows what things you want, before you ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus, therefore, pray you: Our Father, who art in heaven, thy name be hallowed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>thy Reign come; thy will be done upon earth, as it is in heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>give us today our daily bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and lead us not into temptation, but preserve us from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if you forgive not others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover, when you fast, look not dismal, as the hypocrites, who disfigure their faces, that men may observe that they fast. Indeed, I say to you, they have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that your fasting may not appear to men, but to your Father; and your Father, to whom, though he is unseen himself, nothing is secret, will recompense you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Amass not for yourselves treasure upon the earth, where moths and rust may consume it, or thieves breaking in may steal it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But provide for yourselves treasure in heaven, where are neither moths nor rust to consume it, nor thieves to break in and steal it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, your heart will also be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The eye is the lamp of the body. If, therefore, your eye be sound, your whole body will be enlightened;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but if your eye be distempered, your whole body will be dark. And if even the light which is in you be darkness, how great will the darkness be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A man can not serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or at least he will attend to one, and neglect the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore I charge you, be not anxious about your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor about your body, what you shall wear. Is not life a greater gift than food; and the body more than raiment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Observe the fowls of heaven. They neither sow nor reap. They have no storehouse; but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you much more valuable than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Besides, which of you can, by his anxiety, prolong his life one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why are you anxious about raiment? Mark the lilies of the field. How do they grow? They toil not: they spin not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet I affirm that even Solomon in all his glory, was not equally adorned with one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If, then, God so array the herbage, which today is in the field, and to-morrow will be cast into the oven, will he not much more array you, O you distrustful!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore say not anxiously, (as the heathens do,) What shall we eat; or what shall we drink; or with what shall we be clothed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek first the kingdom of God and the righteousness required by him; and all these things shall be superadded to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Be not then anxious about the morrow: the morrow will be anxious about itself. Sufficient for every day is its own trouble.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
