Are grapes gathered from thorns; or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good tree yields good fruit, and every evil tree evil fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree can not yield evil fruit, nor an evil tree good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree which yields not good fruit, is cut down, and turned into fuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore, by their fruits you shall discover them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not every one who says to me, Master, Master, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father, who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to me on that day, Master, Master, have we not taught in thy name, and in thy name performed many miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>To whom I will declare, I never acknowledged you. Depart from me, you who practice iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, whosoever hears these my precepts, and does them, I will compare to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For although the rain descended, and the rivers overflowed, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, it fell not, because it was founded upon the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But whosoever hears these my precepts, and does them not, shall be compared to a simpleton, who built his house upon the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For when the rain descended, and the rivers overflowed, and the winds blew, and dashed against that house, it fell, and great was its ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When Jesus had ended this discourse, the people were struck with awe at his manner of teaching;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he taught as one who had authority, and not as the Scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
