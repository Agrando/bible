This explains what fell by the way-side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That which fell on rocky ground, denotes him who, hearing the word, receives it at first with pleasure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet, not having it rooted in his mind, retains it but a while; for when trouble or persecution comes, because of the word, instantly he relapses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That which fell among thorns, denotes that hearer in whom worldly cares, and deceitful riches, choke the word, and render it unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But that which fell into good soil, and bore fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty fold, denotes him, who not only hears and considers, but obeys the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a field, in which the proprietor has sown good grain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but while people were asleep, his enemy came, and sowed darnel among the wheat, and went off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the blade was up, and putting forth the ear, then appeared also the darnel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the servants came, and said to their master, Sir, you sowed good grain in your field; whence, then, has it darnel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He answered, An enemy has done this. They said, Will you, then, that we weed them out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He replied, No, lest in weeding out the darnel, you tear up the wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, first gather the darnel, and make them into bundles for burning; then carry the wheat into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another similitude he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man planted in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for though it is the smallest of seeds, when grown, larger than any herb, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air take the shelter in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another similitude he gave them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman mingled in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these similitudes Jesus spoke to the people; for he taught them only by similitudes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>«in this verifying the word of the Prophet,» 'I will discourse in parables; I will utter things concerning which, all antiquity has been silent.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus, leaving the multitude, retired to the house, where his disciples accosted him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus answering, said to them, He who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; and the darnel are the sons of the evil one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the conclusion of this state; and the reapers are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As, therefore, the darnel is gathered and burnt, so shall it be at the conclusion of this state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of Man will send his angels who shall gather out of his kingdom all seducers and iniquitous persons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and throw them into the burning furnace: weeping and gnashing of teeth shall be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then shall the righteous shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field, which, when a man has discovered, he conceals the discovery, and for joy thereof, sells all that he has, and buys that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a pearl extremely precious, which a merchant, in quest of fine pearls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>having found, sold all that he had, and purchased it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a sweep-net cast into the seam which encloses fish of every kind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When it is full, they draw it ashore, and gather the good into vessels, but throw the useless away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So it shall be at the conclusion of this state. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and throw them into the burning furnace. Weeping and gnashing of teeth shall be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said, Do you understand all these things? They answered, Yes, Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He added, Every scribe, therefore, instructed for the Reign of Heaven, is like a householder, who brings out of his storehouse new things and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And after he had finished these similitudes, he departed thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus being come into his own country, taught the inhabitants in their synagogue; and they said with astonishment, Whence has this man this wisdom, and this power of working miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And do not his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and all his sisters, live amongst us? Whence, then, has he all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Thus they were offended at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is no where disregarded, except in his own country, and in his own family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
