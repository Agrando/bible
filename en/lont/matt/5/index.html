If the salt become insipid, how shall its saltness be restored? It is thenceforth fit only to be cast out, and trod under foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are the light of the world. A city situate on a mountain must be conspicuous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A lamp is lighted to be put, not under a vessel, but on a stand, that it may shine to all the family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus, let your light shine before men, that they, seeing your good actions, may glorify your Father, who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Think not that I am come to subvert the law or the prophets. I am come not to subvert, but to ratify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, indeed, I say to you, heaven and earth shall sooner perish, than one iota, or on tittle of the law shall perish, without attaining its end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whosoever, therefore, shall violate, or teach others to violate, were it the least of these commandments, shall be in no esteem in the Reign of Heaven; but whosoever shall practice and teach them, shall be highly esteemed in the Reign of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I tell you, that unless your righteousness excel the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>«You have heard that it was said to the ancients,'You shall not commit murder; for whosoever commits murder shall be obnoxious to the judges.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you, whosoever is angry with his brother unjustly, shall be obnoxious to the judges; whosoever shall call him fool, shall be obnoxious to the council; but whosoever shall call him miscreant, shall be obnoxious to hell fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar, and there recollect, that your brother has ground to complain of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave there your gift before the altar: first go and procure reconciliation with your brother; then come, and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Compound speedily with your creditor, while you are on the road together; lest he deliver you to the judge; and the judge consign you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Indeed, I say to you, you will not be released, until you have discharged the last farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>«You have heard that it was said,'You shall not commit adultery.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you, whoever looks on another man's wife, in order to cherish impure desire, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore, if your right eye ensnare you, pluck it out, and throw it away: it is better for you to lose one of your members, than that your whole body be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand ensnare you, cut it off and throw it away: it is better for you to lose one of your members, than that your whole body be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>«It has been said,'Whosoever would dismiss his wife, let him give her a writ of divorce.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say to you, whosoever shall dismiss his wife, except for whoredom, is the occasion of her becoming an adulteress; and whosoever marries her that is dismissed, commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>«Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients,'You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say to you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither shall you swear by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>not by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your yes, be Yes; your no, No; for whatever exceeds these, proceeds from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>«You have heard that it was said,'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I say to you, contend not with the injurious. But if any one strike you on the right cheek, turn to him also the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Whoever will sue you for your coat, let him have your mantle likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if a man constrain you to go one mile with him, go two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to him that asks you; and him that would borrow from you, put not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>«You have heard that it was said,'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, love your enemies; bless them who curse you; do good to them who hate you; and pray for them who arraign and persecute you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>that you may be children of your Father in heaven, who makes his sun arise on bad and good, and sends rain on just and unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love them only who love you, what reward can you expect? Do not even the publicans so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you salute your brothers only, wherein do you excel? Do not even the Pagans as much?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Be you therefore perfect, as your father who is in heaven is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
