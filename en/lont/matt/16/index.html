You can judge aright of the appearance of the sky, but can you not discern the signs of the times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>An evil and adulterous race demands a sign, but no sign shall be given it, except the sign of the Prophet Jonah. Then leaving them he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now his disciples, before they came over, had forgot to bring loaves with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to them, Take head, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On which they said, reasoning among themselves, This is because we have brought no loaves with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus perceiving it, said, What do you reason amongst yourselves, O you distrustful! that I speak thus, because you have brought no loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have you no reflection? or do you not remember the five loaves among the five thousand, and how many baskets you filled with the fragments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor the seven loaves among the four thousand, and how many hand-baskets you filled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How is it, that you do not understand, that I spoke not concerning bread, when I bade you beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood, that he cautioned them not against the leaven which the Pharisees and the Sadducees used in bread, but against their doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As Jesus was going to the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They answered, Some say, John the Immerser; others, Elijah; others, Jeremiah, or one of the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But who, returned he, do you say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon Peter answering, said, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus replying, said to him, Happy are you, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I tell you, likewise, you are named Stone; and on this rock I will build my congregation, over which the gates of Hades shall not prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover, I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: whatever you shall bind on the earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you shall loose on the earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he forbade his disciples to tell any many that he is the Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time Jesus began to disclose to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and there suffer much from the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and that he must be raised the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On which, Peter taking him aside, reproved him, saying, Be this far from you, Master; this shall not befall you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he turning, said to Peter, Get you thence, adversary, you are an obstacle in my way; for you relish not the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come under my guidance, let him renounce himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For, whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, with the forfeit of his life? or what will a man not give in ransom for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of Man, vested with his Father's glory, shall come hereafter with his heavenly messengers, and recompense every one according to his actions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Indeed, I say to you, some of those who are present, shall not taste death, until they see the Son of Man enter upon his Reign.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
