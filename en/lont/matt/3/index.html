Then John acquiesced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus being immersed, no sooner arose out of the water, than heaven was opened to him; and the Spirit of God appeared, descending like a dove, and lighting upon him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>while a voice from heaven proclaimed, This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I delight.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
