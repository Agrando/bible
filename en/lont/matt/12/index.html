They asked Jesus, with a design to accuse him, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, What man is there amongst you, who having one sheep, if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And does not a mean greatly excel a sheep? It is lawful, therefore, to do good on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And as he stretched it out, it became sound like the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Pharisees went out, and concerted against Jesus to destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus knowing this, departed; and being followed by a vast multitude, healed all their sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>enjoining them not to make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus the word of the Prophet Isaiah was verified,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>«Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul delights; I will cause my Spirit to abide upon him, and he shall give laws to the nations;»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>he will not contend, nor clamor, nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A bruised reed he will not break; and a dimly burning taper he will not quench, till he render his laws victorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>«Nations also shall trust in his name.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then was brought to him a demoniac, dumb, and blind, and he cured him, so that he both spoke and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the people said with amazement, Is this the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the Pharisees hearing them, said, This man expels demons only by Beelzebub, prince of the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus, knowing their surmises, said to them, By intestine dissensions any kingdom may be desolated; and no city or family, where such dissensions are, can subsist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now if Satan expel Satan, his kingdom is torn by intestine dissensions; how can it then subsist?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Besides, if I expel demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons expel them? Wherefore they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I expel demons by the Spirit of God, the Reign of God has overtaken you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For how can one enter the strong one's house, and plunder his goods, unless he first overpower the strong one? Then indeed he may plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He who is not for me, is against me; and he who gathers not with me, scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Wherefore I say to you, though every other sin and detraction in men is pardonable, their detraction from the Spirit is unpardonable:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for whosoever shall inveigh against the Son of Man may obtain pardon; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, shall never be pardoned, either in the present state or the future.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Either call the tree good, and its fruit good; or call the tree bad, and its fruit bad: for we distinguish the tree by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Offspring of vipers! how can you that are evil speak good things, since it is out of the fullness of the heart that the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The good man, out of his good treasure, produces good things; the bad man, out of his bad treasure, produces bad things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be assured, however, that of every pernicious word which men shall utter, they shall give an account on the day of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by your words you shall be acquitted, and by your words you shall be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then some of the Scribes and Pharisees interposed, saying, Rabbi, we desire to see a sign for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He answering, said to them, An evil and adulterous race demands a sign; but no sign shall be given it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish, the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the bosom of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Ninevites will stand up in the judgment against this race, and cause it to be condemned, because they reformed when they were warned by Jonah; and behold here something greater than Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The Queen of the South country will arise in the judgment against this race, and cause it to be condemned; because she came from the extremities of the earth to hear the wise discourses of Solomon; and behold here something greater than Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>An unclean spirit, when he is gone out of a man, wanders over the parched deserts in search of a resting-place. And not finding any,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he says, I will return to my house whence I came; and being come, he finds it empty, swept, and garnished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he goes, and brings with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and having entered, they dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first: thus will it fare with this evil race.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he discoursed to the people, his mother and brothers were without, desiring to speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And one said to him, Your mother and your brothers are without, desiring to speak with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He answering, said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whosoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
