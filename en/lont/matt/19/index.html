What, then, God has conjoined, let not man separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They replied, Why, then, did Moses command to give a writing of divorce, and dismiss her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He answered, Moses, indeed, because of your intractable disposition, permitted you to divorce your wives, but it was not so from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for whoredom, and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries the woman divorced, commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples said to him, If such be the condition of the husband, it is better to live unmarried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, They alone are capable of living thus, on whom the power is conferred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For some are eunuchs from their birth; others have been made eunuchs by men; and others, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, have made themselves eunuchs. Let him act this part who can act it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then children were presented to him, that he might lay his hands on them, and pray, but the disciples reproved them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus said, Let the children alone, and hinder them not from coming to me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having laid his hands on them, he departed thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Afterward, one approaching, said to him, Good Teacher, what good must I do to obtain eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He answered, Why do you call me good? God alone is good. If you would enter into that life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>«He said to him, Which? Jesus answered, » 'You shall not commit murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>«Honor father and mother; and love your neighbor as yourself.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man replied, All these I have observed from my childhood. In what am I still deficient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered, If you would be perfect, go sell your estate, and give the price to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The young man hearing this, went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples, Indeed, I say to you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I say further, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The disciples, who heard this with amazement, said, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus, looking at them, answered, With men this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter replying, said, As for us, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what then shall be our reward?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that at the Renovation, when the Son of Man shall be seated on his glorious throne, you, my followers, sitting upon the twelve thrones, shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And whoever shall have forsaken, on my account, houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, shall receive a hundred fold, and inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many shall be first that are last, and last that are first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
