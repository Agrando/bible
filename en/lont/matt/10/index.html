I send you forth as sheep amidst wolves. Be therefore prudent as the serpents, and harmless as the doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But be upon your guard against these men; for they will deliver you to councils, and scourge you in their synagogues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and you shall be brought before governors and kings, on my account, to bear testimony to them, and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how, or what you shall speak; for what you shall speak shall be suggested to you in that moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it shall not be you that shall speak; but the Spirit of my Father, who will speak by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the brother will deliver up the brother to death; and the father the child; and children will arise against their parents, and procure their death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And for my name you shall be hated universally. But the man who perseveres to the end, shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore, when they persecute you in one city, flee to another; for indeed, I say to you, you shall not have gone through the cities of Israel, till the Son of Man be come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is enough for the disciple to be as his teacher, and for the servant to be as his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more his domestics?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore, fear them not; for there is nothing hid that shall not be detected; nothing secret that shall not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What I tell you in the dark, publish in the light; and what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the house tops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And fear not them you kill the body, but can not kill the soul; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet neither of them falls to the ground without your Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nay, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Fear not, then; you are much more valuable than sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Whoever, therefore, shall acknowledge me before men, him will I also acknowledge before my Father, who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whoever shall disown me before men, him will I also disown before my Father, who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Think not that I am come to bring peace to the earth. I came not to bring peace, but a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I am come to cause dissension between father and son, between mother and daughter, between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>so that a man's enemies will be found in his own family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He who loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me. He who loves son or daughter more than me, is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He who will not take his cross and follow me, is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He who preserves his life, shall lose it: but he who loses his life, on my account, shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He that receives you, receives me; and he that receives me, receives him who sent me, receives him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He that receives a prophet, because he is a prophet, shall obtain a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man, because he is a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and whosoever shall give one of these little ones, because he is my disciple, a single cup of cold water to drink; indeed, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
