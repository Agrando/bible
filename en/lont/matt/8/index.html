Immediately he was cured of his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jesus said to him, See you tell no person; but go, show yourself to the priest, and make the oblation prescribed by Moses, for notifying the cure to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Having entered Capernaum, a centurion accosted him with this request,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sir, my man-servant lies sick at home, exceedingly afflicted with a palsy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered, I will go and cure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The centurion replying, said, Sir, I am not worthy, that you should come under my roof; only say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For even I, who am under command myself, having soldiers under me, say to one, Go, and he goes; to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus hearing this, was astonished, and said to those who followed, Indeed, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found so great faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I assure you, that many will come from the east and from the west, and will be placed at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>while the sons of the kingdom shall be thrust out into outer darkness, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go home; be it to you, according to your faith. That instant his servant was cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus having entered Peter's house, saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and having touched her hand, the fever left her; on which she arose and entertained him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the evening they presented to him many demoniacs; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and cured all the sick;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>«thus verifying the saying of the Prophet Isaiah,» 'He has himself carried off our infirmities, and borne our distresses.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus seeing himself crowded on all sides, gave orders to pass to the opposite shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Meantime, a scribe accosted him, saying, Rabbi, I will follow you whithersoever you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have places of shelter, but the Son of Man has not where to repose his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Another, one of his disciples, said to him, Master, permit me to go first, and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus answered, Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then entering the bark, his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Soon after there arose in the sea so great a tempest, that the bark was covered with billows. But he being asleep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the disciples came and waked him, saying, Save us, Master, we perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He answered, Why are you so timorous, O you distrustful? Then he arose, and having commanded the winds and the sea, a great calm ensued;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>insomuch that every one exclaimed with admiration, What personage is this, whom even the winds and the sea obey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he was come to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two demoniacs, issuing out of the monuments, so furious, that no person durst pass that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>These instantly cried, saying, What hast thou to do with us, Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now there was feeding, at some distance, a great herd of swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the friends besought him, saying, If thou expel us, permit us to go into the herd of swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He answered, Go. And when they were cast out, they went into the swine; on which the whole herd rushed down a precipice into the sea, and perished in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the herdsmen fled into the city, and reported everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Presently the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and having seen him, entreated him to depart out of their territory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
