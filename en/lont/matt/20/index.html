Accordingly they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again, about the sixth hour, and about the ninth, he went out and did the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Lastly, about the eleventh hour, he went out, and finding others standing, said to them, Why do you stand here all the day doing nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They answered, Because no person has hired us. He said to them, Go you also into my vineyard, and you shall receive what is reasonable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When it was night, the proprietor of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the laborers, and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, and ending with the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they who had been hired at the eleventh hour came, and received each a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the first came, they imagined they should receive more; but they got only a denarius a-piece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Upon receiving it, they murmured against the householder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, These last have worked but one hour; yet you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden and heat of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He answering, said to one of them, Friend, I do you no injury. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take what is yours, and depart. It is my will to give to this last as much as to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And may not I do what I will with my own? Is your eye evil, because I am good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus the last shall be first, and first last; for there are many called, but few chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus was on the road to Jerusalem, he took the twelve aside, and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We are now going to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes, who will condemn him to die,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified; but the third day he will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to him with her sons, and, prostrating herself, entreated he would grant the request she had to make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said to her, What do you wish? She answered, That, in your Reign, one of these my two sons may sit at your right hand, the other at your left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus replying, said, You know not what you ask. Can you drink such a cup as I must drink? They said to him, We can.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He answered, You shall indeed drink such a cup. But to sit on my right hand, and at my left, I can not give, unless to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The then, hearing this, were full of indignation against the two brothers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but Jesus, calling them to him, said, You know that the Princes of the nations domineer over them, and the great exercise their authority upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It must not be so amongst you: on the contrary, whosoever would become great amongst you, let him be your servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and whosoever would be chief amongst you, let him be your slave:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As they left Jericho, followed by a great multitude,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>two blind men, who sat by the way-side, hearing that Jesus passed by cried, saying, Master, Son of David, have pity on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The multitude charged them to be silent: but they cried the louder, saying, Master, Son of David, have pity on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus stopping, called them, and said, What do you want me to do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered, Sir, to make us see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus had compassion and touched their eyes. Immediately they received sight, and followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
