Then opening their caskets, they offered, as presents to him, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went home another way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When they were gone, lo! a messenger of the Lord appearing to Joseph in a dream, said, Arise, take the child with his mother, and flee into Egypt; and remain there till I order you; for Herod will seek the child to destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Accordingly he arose, took the child with his mother, and withdrew by night into Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>«where he continued until the death of Herod; so that, what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet, was verified,» 'Out of Egypt I called my Son.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herod, finding that he had been deceived by the magicians, was highly incensed and dispatched emissaries who slew, by his order, all the male children in Bethlehem, and in all its territory, from those entering the second year, down to the time of which he had procured exact information from the magicians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then was the word of Jeremiah the Prophet verified,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>«A cry was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and weeping, and bitter complaint: Rachel bewailing her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appearing in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Arise, take the child with his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Accordingly, he arose, took the child with his mother, and came to the land of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod in the throne of Judea, he was afraid to return thither; and being warned in a dream, retired into the district of Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and resided in a city named Nazareth; in this verifying the declarations of the Prophet concerning Jesus, that he should be called a Nazarene.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
