Thus they will treat the Son of Man also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciple understood, that he spoke concerning John the Immerser.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When they were come to the multitude, a man came to him, who kneeling, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Sir, have pity on my son; for he is grievously distressed with lunacy; often he falls into the fire, and often into the water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and I presented him to your disciples; but they could not cure him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus answering, said, O unbelieving and perverse race! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and he came out: and the lad was instantly cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>At that time the disciple came to him privately, saying, Why could not we expel the demon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered, Because of your unbelief; for, indeed, I say to you, if you had faith, though but as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mountain, Remove to yonder place, and it would remove: yes, nothing would be impossible to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This kind, however, is not dispossessed, unless by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they remained in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is to be delivered up to men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who will kill him: but the third day he shall be raised again. And they were grieved exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When they were come to Capernaum, the collectors came and asked Peter, Does not your teacher pay the didrachma?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said, Yes. Being come into the house, before he spoke, Jesus said to him, What is your opinion, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth exact tribute or custom? from their own sons, or from others?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter answered, From others. Jesus replied, The sons then are exempted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nevertheless, lest we shall give them offense, go to the sea and throw a line, draw out the first fish that is hooked, and, having opened its mouth, you shall find a stater; take that, and give it to them for me and you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
