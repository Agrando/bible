A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man effeminately dressed? It is king's palaces that such frequent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and something superior to a prophet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>«for this is he, concerning whom it is written,'Behold I will send my angel before you, who shall prepare your way.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Indeed, I say to you, among those that are born of women, there has not arisen a greater than John the Immerser. Yet the least in the Reign of Heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From the first appearing of John the Immerser until now, the kingdom of heaven is invaded, and invaders take possession by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For till John appeared, all the prophets and the law were your instructions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and, if you will bear to be told it, this is the Elijah that was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like boys in the market places, to whom their playfellows complain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying, We have played to you upon the pipe, but you have not danced; we have sung mournful songs to you, but you have not lamented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came abstaining from meat and drink, and they say, He has a demon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the Son of Man came using meat and drink, and they say, He is a lover of banquets and wine, a companion of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to reproach the cities, in which most of his miracles had been performed, because they reformed not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles which have been performed in you, had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they had reformed long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Know, therefore, that the condition of Tyre and Sidon, on the day of judgment, shall be more tolerable than yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou, Capernaum, which hast been exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to Hades; for, if the miracles which have been performed in thee, had been performed in Sodom, it had remained till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Know, therefore, that the condition of Sodom, on the day of judgment, shall be more tolerable than thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>On that occasion Jesus said, I adore thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because, having concealed these things from sages and the learned, thou hast revealed them to babes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>yes, Father, because such is thy pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My Father has imparted everything to me; and no one knows the Son, except the Father; neither knows any one the Father, except the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to me, all you who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you, and be taught by me; for I am meek and condescending: and your souls shall find relief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
