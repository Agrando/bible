They answered, What is that to us? See you to that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>After which, having thrown down the money in the temple, he went away, and strangled himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The chief priests taking the money, said, It is not lawful to put it into the sacred treasury, because it is the price of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, after deliberating, they bought with it the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for which reason that field is, to this day, called, The Field of Blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>«Then was the word of Jeremiah the Prophet verified,» 'The thirty shekels, the price at which he was valued, I took, as the Lord appointed me, from the sons of Israel,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who gave them for the potter's field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Jesus appeared before the procurator, who questioned him, saying, You are the King of the Jews? He answered, You say right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when he was arraigned by the chief priests and the elders, he made no reply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear of how many crimes they accuse you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he answered not one word, which surprised the procurator exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the procurator was accustomed to release, at the festival, any one of the prisoners whom the multitude demanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they had then a famous prisoners named Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore. when they were assembled, Pilate said to them, Whom shall I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is called Messiah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(For he perceived that through envy they had delivered him up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>besides, while he was sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent him this message, Have nothing to do with this innocent person; for today, I have suffered much in a dream, on his account.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the chief priests and elders instigated the populace to demand Barabbas, and cause Jesus to be executed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, when the procurator asked, which of the two he should release, they all answered, Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate replied, What then shall I do with Jesus, whom they call Messiah? They all answered, Let him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The procurator said, Why? What evil has he done? But they cried the louder, saying, Let him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pilate perceiving that he was so far from prevailing, that they grew more tumultuous, took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this innocent person. See you to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the people answering, said, His blood be upon us, and upon your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he released Barabbas to them, and having caused Jesus to be scourged, delivered him up to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After this, the procurator's soldiers took Jesus into the praetorium, where they gathered around him all the band.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having stripped him, they robed him in a scarlet cloak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and crowned him with a wreath of thorns, and put a rod in his right hand, and kneeling before him in mockery. cried, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And spitting upon him, they took the rod and struck him with it on the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When they had mocked him, they disrobed him again, and having put his own raiment on him, led him away to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As they went out of the city, they met one Simon, a Cyrenian, whom they constrained to carry the cross;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and being arrived at a place called Golgotha, which signifies a Place of Skulls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they gave him to drink, vinegar mixed with wormwood, which, having tasted, he would not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>After they had nailed him to the cross, they parted his garments by lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And having sat down there, they guarded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And over his head they placed this inscription, denoting the cause of his death: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Two robbers also were crucified with him, one at his right hand, and the other at his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Meanwhile the passengers reviled him, shaking their heads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and saying, You who could demolish the temple, and rebuild it in three days; if you be God's Son, come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The chief priests also, with the scribes and elders, deriding him, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He saved others: can he not save himself? If he be King of Israel, let him now descend from the cross, and we will believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He trusted in God. Let God deliver him now, if he regard him; for he called himself God's Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The robbers too, his fellow-sufferers, upbraided him in the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from the sixth hour to the ninth, the whole land was in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>About the ninth hour, Jesus cried aloud, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Some of the bystanders hearing this, said, He calls Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Instantly one of them ran, brought a sponge, and soaked it in vinegar, and having fastened it to a stick, presented it to him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The rest said, Forbear, we shall see whether Elijah will come to save him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus having again cried with a loud voice, resigned his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, behold, the vail of the temple was rent in two from top to bottom, the earth trembled, and the rocks split.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Graves also burst open; and after his resurrection, the bodies of several saints who slept were raised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>came out of the graves, went into the holy city, and were seen by many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now the centurion, and they who, with him, guarded Jesus, observing the earthquake, and what passed, were exceedingly terrified, and said, This was certainly the son of a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Several women also were there, looking on at a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, assisting him with their service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Among them were Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>In the evening a rich Arimathean named Joseph, who was himself a disciple of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>went to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus. Pilate having given orders to deliver it to Joseph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>he took the body, wrapped it in clean linen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and deposited it in his own tomb, which he had newly caused to be hewn in the rock; and having rolled a great stone to the entrance, he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Now Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary were there, sitting over against the sepulcher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>On the morrow, being the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees repaired in a body to Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>and said, My lord, we remember that this impostor, when alive, said, Within three days I shall be raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Command, therefore, that the sepulcher be guarded till the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him, and say to the people, He is raised from the dead; for this last imposture would prove worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate answered, You have a guard; make the sepulcher as secure as you can.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Accordingly they went and secured it, sealing the stone, and posting guards.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
