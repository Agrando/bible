Supply them yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They said to him, We have here but five loaves and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He replied, Bring them hither to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then having commanded the people to recline upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking toward heaven, blessed them; then breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and they distributed them among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When all had eat, and were satisfied, they carried off twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now they that had eat were about five thousand men; besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Immediately he obliged the disciples to embark and pass over before him, while he dismissed the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Having dismissed the multitude, he retired by himself to a mountain to pray, and remained there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By that time the bark was half way over, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, being terrified, they exclaimed, An apparition! and cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I, be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter answering, said to him, If it be you, Master, bid me to come to you on the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said, Come. Then Peter getting out of the bark, walked on the water toward Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But finding the wind boisterous, he was frightened; and beginning to sink, cried, Master, save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus instantly stretching out his hand, caught him; and said to him, Distrustful man, wherefore did you doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When they had gone aboard, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then those in the bark came, and prostrated themselves before him, saying, You are assuredly God's son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Having passed over, they landed on the territory of Gennesaret;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the inhabitants of which knowing him, sent through all that country, and brought to him all the diseased,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>who besought him to let them touch but a tuft of his mantle; and as man as touched were cured.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
