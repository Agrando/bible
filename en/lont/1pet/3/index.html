Therefore, do not fear their fear, neither be troubled:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts; and be always prepared for giving an answer, with meekness and reverence, to every one who asks of you a reason for the hope which is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hold fast a good conscience, that, whereas they speak against you as evil doers, they may be put to shame who arraign your good behavior in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better to suffer as well doers, if the will of God appoints it, than as evil doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For even Christ once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to death, indeed, in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By which, also, he made proclamation to the spirits in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who formerly were disobedient, when the patience of God once waited, in the days of Noah, while an ark was preparing, in which few, that is, eight souls, were effectually saved through water-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>the antitype, immersion, does, also, now save us, (not putting away the filth of the flesh; but seeking of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who, having gone into heaven, is at the right hand of God; angels, and authorities, and powers, being subjected to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
