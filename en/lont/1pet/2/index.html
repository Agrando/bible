Those who stumble at the word, are disobedient unbelievers, to which, therefore, they were appointed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but you are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people; that you should declare the perfections of him who has called you from darkness into his marvelous light:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who formerly were not a people, but now are a people of God; who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, I beseech you, as sojourners and travelers, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have your behavior comely, among the Gentiles, that, whereas, they speak against you, as evil doers, having beheld your good works, they may glorify God, in the day of visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be subject, therefore, to every human establishment for the Lord's sake; whether to the king, as supreme;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to governor, as those sent by him for the punishment, indeed, of evil doers; but for the praise of them who do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For so is the will of God, that, by doing good, you put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Live as freemen, yet do not use your freedom as a covering of wickedness; but as the servants of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Treat all men with respect: love the brotherhood: fear God: honor the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let household servants be subject to their masters, with all reverence; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For this is acceptable, if any one, from conscience of God, sustain sorrows, suffering unjustly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But what praise is due, if, when you commit faults and are buffeted, you bear it patiently?
