This sprang sooner, because there was no depth of soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But after the sun had beaten upon it, it was scorched, and having no root, it withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Part fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and stifled it, so that it yielded nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Part fell into good ground, and sprang up, and became so fruitful, that some grains produced thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He added. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When he was in private, those who were about him with the twelve, asked him the meaning of the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said to them, It is your privilege to know the secrets of the Reign of God, but to those without everything is veiled in parables;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that they may not perceive what they look at, or understand what they hear; lest they should be reclaimed, and obtain the forgiveness of their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He said also to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower is he who disperses the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The wayside on which some of the grain fell, denotes those who have no sooner heard the word, than Satan comes, and takes away that which was sown in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The rocky ground denotes those, who, hearing the word, receive it first with pleasure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>yet not having it rooted in their minds, retain it but a while; for when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they instantly relapse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The ground overrun with thorns, denotes those hearers</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in whom worldly cares, and delusive riches, and the inordinate desire of other things, stifle the word, and render it unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The good soil on which some grains yielded thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred, denotes those who hear the word, and retain it, and produce the fruits thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said further, Is a lamp brought to be put under a vessel, or under a bed, and not to be set on a stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is no secret, that is not discovered; nor has anything been concealed, which is not to be divulged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said, moreover, Consider what you hear: with the measure with which you give, you shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For to him who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said also, The kingdom of God is like seed, which a man sowed in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>While he slept by night, and waked by day, the seed shot up, and grew without his minding it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth produces of itself first the blade, then the ear; afterward the full corn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as soon as the grain was ripe, he applied the sickle, because it was time to reap it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He said also, To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or by what similitude shall we represent it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is the smallest of all the seeds that are there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after it is sown, it springs up, and becomes greater than any herb, and shoots out branches so large, that under their shades, the birds of the air may find shelter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in many such similitudes, he conveyed instruction to the people, as he found them disposed to hear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and without a similitude he told them nothing; but he solved all to his disciples in private.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That day, in the evening, he said to them, Let us pass to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they, leaving the people, but having him in the bark, set sail in company with other small barks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then there arose a great storm of wind which drove the billows into the bark, which was now full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus being in the stern, asleep on a pillow, they awake him, saying, Rabbi, do you not care that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he arose, and commanded the wind, saying to the sea, Peace! be still! Immediately the wind ceased, and great calm ensued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said to them, Why are you so timorous? How is it that you have no faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they were exceedingly terrified, and said one to another, Who is this, whom even the wind and the sea obey?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
