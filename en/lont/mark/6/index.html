What wisdom is this which he has gotten? and how are so great miracles performed by him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters also here with us? And they were offended at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus said to them, A prophet is no where disregarded, except in his own country, and amongst his own relations, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he could do no miracle there, excepting curing a few sick by laying his hands on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he wondered at their unbelief. And he went through the neighboring villages teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And having called to him the twelve, he sent them out two by two, and gave them power over the unclean spirits;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and ordered them to take nothing for their journey, but a single staff; no bag, no bread, and in their girdle no money;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>to be shod with sandals, and not to put on two coats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said also, Whatever house you enter in any place, continue in that house, till you leave the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But wheresoever they will not receive you, nor hear you, shake off the dust under your feet at your departure, as a protestation against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And being departed, they publicly warned men to reform;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and expelled many demons, and cured many sick persons, anointing them with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And King Herod heard of him, (for his name was become famous) and said, John the Immerser is raised from the dead; and therefore miracles are performed by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others said, It is Elijah. Others, It is a prophet like those of ancient times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard of him, he said, This is John whom I beheaded. He is raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod had caused John to be apprehended, and kept bound in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had himself married.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now this roused Herodias' resentment, who would have killed John, but could not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because Herod respected him, and knowing him to be a just and holy man, protected him; and did many things recommended by him, and heard him with pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At length a favorable opportunity offered, which was Herod's birthday, when he made an entertainment for the great officers of his court and army, and the persons of distinction in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the daughter of Herodias came in, and danced before them, and pleased Herod and his guests so much, that the king said to the young woman, Ask whatever you will, and I will give it you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>nay, he swore to her, Whatsoever you shall ask, I will give it you, were it the half of my kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she withdrew, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? She answered, The head of John the Immerser.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Her daughter then, returning hastily to the king, made this request: I would that you give me presently in a basin, the head of John the Immerser.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king was much grieved; however, from a regard to his oath, and his guests, he would not refuse her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and immediately dispatched a sentinel with orders to bring the Immerser's head. Accordingly he went, and beheaded him in the prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and brought his hand in a basin, and presented it to the young woman; and the young woman presented it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When his disciples heard this, they went and brought his corpse, and laid it in a monument.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now the Apostles, being assembled, related everything to Jesus, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to them, Come you apart into a desert place, and rest awhile; for there were so many coming and going, that they had not leisure so much as to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they retired by ship to a desert place, to be by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But many who saw them depart, and knew whither they were sailing, ran out of all the cities, and came together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Being landed, he saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them; because they were as a flock which has no shepherd; and he taught them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, This is a desert place, and it is now late;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>dismiss the people, that they may go to the neighboring farms and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answering, said to them, Supply them yourselves. They replied, Shall we go and give two hundred denarii for bread, in order to supply them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said to them, How many loaves have you? Go and see. Upon inquiry, they answered, Five and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he commanded them to make all the people recline upon the green grass in separate companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they formed themselves into squares, by hundred and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Jesus taking the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the multitude. He distributed also the two fishes among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When they all had eat and were satisfied,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>they carried off twelve baskets full of the fragments of the bread and the fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now they who had eat of the loaves, were five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And immediately he obliged his disciples to embark, and pass over before, toward Bethsaida, while he dismissed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And having sent them away, he retired to a mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>In the evening, the bark being in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>he observed them toiling at the oar, for the wind was against them: and about the fourth watch of the night, he went to them, walking on the water. and seemed intending to pass by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was an apparition, and cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For they all saw him, and were terrified; but he immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I; be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And having gone aboard to them, the wind ceased, which struck them still more with astonishment and admiration.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for their minds were so stupefied, that they never reflected upon the loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When they had crossed, they came to the territory of Gennesaret, where they landed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And being come ashore, the people knew him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and ran through all that country, carrying the sick on couches, to every place where they heard he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And whatever village, or city, or town he entered, they laid the diseased in the streets, and besought him, that they might touch, were it but a tuft of his mantle; and whosoever touched him, were healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
