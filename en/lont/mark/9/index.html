And I spoke to your disciples to expel the demon, but they were not able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus then said, O unbelieving generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? Bring him to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Accordingly they brought him: and no sooner did he see him, than the spirit threw him into convulsions, so that he foamed, and rolled upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus asked the father, How long is it since this first befell him? He answered, From his infancy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and often it has thrown him both into the fire, and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have compassion upon us and help us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus replied, If you can believe; all things are practicable for him who believes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The boy's father, crying out immediately, said with tears, I believe; Master, supply the defects of my faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Jesus saw that the people came crowding upon him, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Dumb and deaf spirit, come out of him, I command you, and enter no more into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then, having cried aloud and severely convulsed him, it came out, and he appeared as one dead, insomuch that many said, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus taking him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When Jesus was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we expel the demon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He answered, This kind can not be dislodged unless by prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Having left that place, they pass through Galilee; and he was desirous that no person should know it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for he was instructing his disciples. And he said to them, The Son of Man will soon be delivered into the hands of men, who will kill him; and after he is killed, he will rise again the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they understood not what he meant, and were afraid to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When he was come to Capernaum, being in the house, he asked them, What were you debating amongst yourselves by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they were silent; for they had debated amongst themselves by the way, who should be greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then having sat down, he called the twelve, and said to them, If any man would be first, he shall be the last of all, and the servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took a child, and placed him in the midst of them, and holding him in his arms, said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whosoever shall receive one such child on my account, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then John said to him, Rabbi, we saw one expelling demons in your name, who follows not us, and we forbade him, because he does not follow us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus answered, Forbid him not; for there is none that works a miracle in my name, that can readily speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For whosoever is not against you is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink on my account, because you are Christ's; indeed, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But whoever shall ensnare any of the little ones, who believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were fastened to his neck, and that he were thrown into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Moreover, if your hand ensnare you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter maimed into life, than having two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>where their worm dies not, and their fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if your foot ensnare you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter lame into life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the unquenchable fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>where their worm dies not, and their fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if your eye ensnare you, pull it out; it is better for you to enter one-eyed into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>where their worm dies not, and their fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For every one shall be seasoned with fire; as every sacrifice is seasoned with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good; but if the salt become tasteless, with what will you season it? Preserve salt in yourselves, and maintain peace with one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
