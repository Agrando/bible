Jesus of Nazareth, what hast thou to do with us? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus rebuking him, said, Be silent, and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions; and, raising loud cried, came out of him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>at which they were all so amazed, that they asked one another, What does this mean? For he commands with authority even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And thenceforth his fame spread through all the region of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as they were come out of the synagogue, they went with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>where Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, of which they immediately acquainted Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came, and taking her by the hand, raised her; instantly the fever left her, and she entertained them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In the evening, after sunset, they brought to him all the sick, and the demoniacs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>the whole city being assembled at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many persons affected with various diseases, and expelled many demons, whom he permitted not to speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On the morrow, having risen before dawn, he went out, and retired to a solitary place, and prayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and his company went in quest of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and having found him, said to him, Every person seeks you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus said, Let us go to the neighboring boroughs, to make proclamation there also: for I came out with this design.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Accordingly he proclaimed in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and expelled demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And a leper came to him, and on his knees entreated him, saying, If you will, you can cleanse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus had compassion, and stretching out his hand and touching him, said, I will, be you clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>This he had no sooner uttered, than the leprosy departed from the man, and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Jesus strictly charging him, and dismissing him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>said, See you tell nothing of this to any man; but go, show yourself to the priest; and offer for your cleansing the things prescribed by Moses, that it may be notified to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But the man, as soon as he was gone, began to blaze this story, talking openly everywhere, insomuch that Jesus could no longer publicly appear in the city; but remained without in solitary places, whither the people resorted to him from all parts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
