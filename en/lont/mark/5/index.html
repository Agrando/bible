I conjure thee by God not to torment me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(For Jesus had said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus asked him, What is your name? He answered, My name is Legion, for we are many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he earnestly entreated him not to drive them out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there was a great herd of swine feeding on the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the fiends besought him, saying, Suffer us to go to the swine, that we may enter into them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus immediately permitted them. Then the unclean spirits being gone out, entered into the swine; and the herd, in number about two thousand, rushed down a precipice into the sea, and were choked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the swineherds fled, and told it in the city and villages. And the people flocked out to see what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind, they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those who had seen the whole, having related to them what had happened to the demoniac, and to the swine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>they entreated him to leave their territories.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As he entered the bark, the man who had been possessed, begged permission to attend him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus however did not permit him, but said, Go home to your relations, and tell them what great things the Lord, in pity, has done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Accordingly he departed, publishing in Decapolis, what great things Jesus had done for him. And they were all amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus having repassed in the bark, a great crowd gathered round him, while he was on the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came one of the directors of the synagogue, named Jairus, who seeing him threw himself at his feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and entreated him earnestly, saying, My little daughter is in extreme danger; I pray you come and lay your hands upon her and to heal her, and she will be well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus went with him, followed by a great multitude who thronged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And a woman, who had been twelve years distressed with an issue of blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>who had suffered much from several physicians, and spent her all without receiving any relief, but rather growing worse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>having heard of Jesus, came in the crowd, behind, and touched his mantle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for she had said, If I but touch his cloths, I shall recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Instantly the source of her distemper was dried up, and she felt in her body, that she was delivered from that scourge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus immediately, conscious of the virtue which had issued from him, turned toward the crowd, saying, Who touched my clothes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>His disciples answered, You see how the multitude throng you; yet you say, Who touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he looked round him, to see her who had done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the woman, knowing the change wrought upon her, came trembling with fear, threw herself prostrate before him, and confessed the whole truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But he said to her, Daughter, your faith has cured you; go in peace, released from this scourge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Before he had done speaking, messengers came from the house of the director of the synagogue, who said, Your daughter is dead, why should you trouble the teacher any further?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus hearing this message delivered, said immediately to the director, Fear not; only believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he allowed no person to follow him except Peter and James, and John, the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Being arrived at the director's house, and seeing the tumult, and the people weeping and wailing immoderately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>he said to them, as he entered, Why do you weep and make a bustle? The child is not dead, but asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they derided him. But having made them all go out, he took with him the child's father and mother, and those who came with him; and he entered the chamber where she was;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and, taking her by the hand, said to her, Talitha cumi, (which signified, Young woman, arise,) I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Immediately the maid arose and walked, for she was twelve years old; and they were confounded with astonishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But he strictly enjoined them not to mention it to any person, and ordered that something should be given her to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
