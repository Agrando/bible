He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>«Have you not read this passage of scripture,» 'A stone which the builders rejected, is made the head of the corner:'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>«this the Lord has performed, and we behold it with admiration?»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they desired to have seized him, but were afraid of the multitude; for they knew that he spoke the parable against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders, leaving Jesus, went away, and sent to him certain Pharisees and Herodians, to catch him in his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These coming up, said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are upright, and stand in awe of none; for you respect not the person of men, but teach the way of God faithfully. Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall we give, or shall we not give? He, perceiving their artifice, answered, Why would you entangle me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When they had brought, he asked them, Whose is the image and inscription? They answered, Cesar's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus replied, Render to Cesar that which is Cesar's, and to God that which is God's. And they wondered at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no future life, and proposed this questions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Rabbi, Moses has enacted, that if a man's brother die, survived by a wife without children, he shall marry the widow, and raise issue to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and dying, left no issue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The second married her, and died; neither did he leave any issue; so did also the third.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus all seven married her, and left no issue. Last of all, the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>At the resurrection, therefore, when they are risen, to which of the seven will she belong; for she has been the wife of them all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus answering, said to them, Is not this the source of your error, your not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For there will be neither marrying, nor giving in marriage, among them who rise from the dead. They will then resemble the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>«But as to the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, how God spoke to him in the bush, saying,'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>God is not a God of the dead, but of the living. Therefore you greatly err.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A scribe, who had heard them dispute, perceiving the justness of his reply, came to him, and proposed this question: Which is the chief commandment of all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>«Jesus answered, The chief of all the commandments is,'Hearken, Israel, the Lord is our God. The Lord is one:'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>«and,» 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.' 'This is the first commandment.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>«The second resembles it:» 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' 'There is no commandment greater than these.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The scribe replied, Truly, Rabbi, you have answered well. There is one, and only one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the spirit, and with all the soul, and with all the strength; and to love one's self, is more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus observing how pertinently he had answered, said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. After that, no person ventured to put questions to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As Jesus was teaching in the temple, he asked them, Why do you scribes assert, that the Messiah must be a son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>«Yet David, himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, says,'The Lord, said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make your foes your footstool.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David himself, therefore, calls him his Lord; how then can he be his son? And the common people heard him with delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Further, in teaching, he said to them, Beware of the scribes, who affect to walk in robes; who love salutations in public places,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the principal seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at entertainments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who devour the families of widows, and use long prayers for a disguise. They shall undergo the severest punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus sitting opposite the treasury, observed the people throwing money into the treasury; and many rich persons put in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then the poor widow came, who threw in two mites, (which make a farthing.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus having called his disciples, said to them, Indeed, I say to you, that this poor widow has given more than any of those who have thrown into the treasury;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for they all have contributed out of their superfluous stores; whereas she has given all the little she had-her whole living.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
