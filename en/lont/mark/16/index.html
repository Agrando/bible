(for it was very large.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when they looked, they saw that the stone had been rolled away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then entering the tomb, they beheld a youth sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were frightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he said to them, Be not frightened; you seek Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He is risen, he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, say to his disciples, and to Peter, He is gone before you to Galilee; where you shall see him, as he told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The women then getting out, fled from the tomb, seized with trembling and consternation; but said nothing to any one, they were so terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus having arisen early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and informed those who had attended him, who were in affliction and tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Afterward he appeared in another form to two of them, as they traveled on foot into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These being returned, informed the other disciples, but neither did they believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At length he appeared to the eleven, as they were eating, and reproached them with their incredulity and obstinacy, in disbelieving those who had seen him after his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said unto them, Go throughout all the world, proclaim the glad tidings to the whole creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who shall believe, and be immersed, shall be saved; but he who shall not believe, shall be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these miraculous powers shall attend the believers:- In my name they shall expel demons. They shall speak in languages unknown to them before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They shall handle serpents with safety. And if they drink poison, it shall not hurt them. They shall cure the sick by laying their hands upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, after the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for them, they went out and proclaimed the tidings everywhere, the Lord co-operating with them, and confirming their doctrine by the miracles with which it was accompanied.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
