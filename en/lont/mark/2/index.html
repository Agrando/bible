Who can forgive sins but God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that they made these reflections, said to them, Why do you reason thus within yourselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, with effect, Arise, take up your couch and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon the earth to forgive sins, rise, (he said to the paralytic,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I command you, take up your couch, and go home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Immediately he rose, took up the couch, and walked out before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Again, he went out toward the sea, and all the multitude repaired to him, and he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Passing along, he saw Levi, son of Alpheus, sitting at the toll office, and said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when Jesus was eating in this man's house, several publicans and sinners placed themselves at table with him and his disciples: for many of these people followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eat with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples, Wherefore does he eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus, hearing this, replied, The whole need not a physician, but the sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The disciples of John, and those of the Pharisees, accustomed to fasting, came to him and said, John's disciples, and those of the Pharisees, fast; why do not your disciples fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered, Do the bridesmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? While the bridegroom is with them they do not fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be take from them; and in those days they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No person sews a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment; otherwise the new patch tears the old cloth, and makes a worse rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>No person puts new wine into old leather bottles; else the new wine bursts the bottle; and thus both the wine is split, and the bottles are rendered useless; but new wine must be put into new bottles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Once, when he was going through the corn on the Sabbath, his disciples began to pluck the ears of corn as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Pharisees said to him, Why do they that which on the Sabbath, it is unlawful to do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered, Did you never read what David and his attendants did, in a strait, when they were hungry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>how he entered the tabernacle of God, in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and eat the loaves of the presence, which none but the priests could lawfully eat, and gave of them also to his attendants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He added, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore the Son of Man is master even of the Sabbath.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
