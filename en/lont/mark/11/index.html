And being come, he found nothing but leaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he said to it, Henceforth let no man ever eat fruit off you. And his disciples heard him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Being returned to Jerusalem, he went into the temple, and drove out them who sold, and them who bought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers, and the stalls of them who sold doves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and would suffer no person to carry vessels through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>«He also taught them, saying, Is it not written,» 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations?' 'but you have made it a den of robbers.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the scribes and the chief priests hearing this, sought means to destroy him; for they dreaded him, because all the multitude admired his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in the evening he went out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Next morning as they returned, they saw that the fig tree was dried up from the root.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter recollecting, said to him, Rabbi, behold the fig tree, which you devoted, already withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus answered, Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For indeed, I say to you, Whoever shall say to this mountain, Be lifted, and thrown into the sea, and shall not in the least doubt, but shall believe that what he says shall happen; whatever he shall command, shall be done for him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for which reason I assure you, that what things soever you pray for, if you believe that you shall obtain them, they shall be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when you pray, forgive, if you have matter of complaint against any; that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father, who is in heaven, forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again, they arrived at Jerusalem; and as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, scribes, and the elders, came,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and said to him, By what authority do you these things? and who empowered you to do them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answering, said to them, I also have a question to ask; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Was the title which John had to immerse, from heaven, or from men? Answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then they argued thus among themselves; If we say, From heaven; he will reply, Why, then, did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if we say, From men; we are in danger from the people, who are all convinced that John was a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They therefore answering, said to Jesus, We can not tell. Jesus replied, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
