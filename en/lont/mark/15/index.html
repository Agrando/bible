He answered, You say right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the chief priests accused him of many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again Pilate asked him, saying, Do you answer nothing? Observe how many crimes they arraign you for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus answered no more, insomuch that Pilate was astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, at the festival, he always released to them any one prisoner, whom they desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was one Barabbas, that had been imprisoned with his seditious associates, who in their sedition had committed murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, with clamor, the multitude demanded of Pilate, what he used to grant them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He answered them, saying, Shall I release to you the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>(For he knew that through envy, the chief priests had delivered him up.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests incited the multitude to insist on the release of Barabbas, in preference to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Pilate again interposed, saying, What then would you have me do with him whom you call king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They cried, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pilate asked them, Why? What evil has he done? But they cried the more vehemently, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Pilate, desirous to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and having caused Jesus to be scourged, delivered him up to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers brought him into the hall called praetorium, where, having convened all the band,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>they arrayed him in purple, and crowned him with a wreath of thorns,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and saluted him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and paid him homage on their knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked him, the stripped him of the purple, and dressed him in his own clothes, and took him away to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they constrained one Simon, a Cyrenian, who passed by, in coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they brought him to Golgotha, (that is to say, The Place of Skulls,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>where they gave him wine to drink, mingled with myrrh, which he would not receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When they had nailed him to the cross, they parted his garments, dividing by lot what every man should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now it was the third hour, when they nailed him to the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the inscription, bearing the cause of his death, was in these words, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They likewise crucified two robbers with him, one at his right hand, and the other at his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>«And the scripture was fulfilled, which says,» 'He was ranked with malefactors.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Meanwhile, they who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ah! you who could demolish the temple, and rebuild it in three days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>save yourself, and come down from the cross!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The chief priests likewise, with the scribes, deriding him, said among themselves, He saved others; can not he save himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe! Even those who were crucified with him reproached him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now from the sixth hour until the ninth, darkness covered all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>At the ninth hour, Jesus cried aloud saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani! which signifies, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Some who were present, hearing this, said, Hark! he calls Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>One at the same time ran, and dipped a sponge in vinegar, and having fastened it to a stick, presented it to him to drink, saying, Let alone, we shall see whether Elijah will come to take him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus sending forth a cry expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then was the vail of the temple rent in two, from top to bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the centurion who stood opposite observing that he expired with so loud a cry, said, Surely, this man was a son of a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There were women also looking on at a distance, amongst whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger, and of Joses and Salome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>(these had followed him, and served him, when he was in Galilee,) and several others, who came with him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When it was evening, (because it was the preparation, that is, the eve of the Sabbath,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable senator, who himself also expected the Reign of God, taking courage, repaired to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Pilate, amazed that he was so soon dead, sent for the centurion, and asked him whether Jesus had been dead any time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And being informed by the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who having bought linen, and taking Jesus down, wrapped him in the linen; and laid him in a tomb, hewn out of the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
