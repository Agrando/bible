But they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And looking around on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their minds, he said to the man, Stretch out your hand: and as he stretched out his hand, it was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Pharisees went out immediately, and conspired with the Herodians against him to destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus withdrew with his disciples toward the sea, whither a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>from Jerusalem, from Idumea, and from the banks of the Jordan. They also of the territories of Tyre and Sidon, having heard what wonders he had performed, flocked to him in crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he ordered his disciples to get a boat to attend him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he had healed many, which made all, who had maladies, press upon him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, prostrated themselves before him, crying, Thou art the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he strictly charged them not to make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Afterward Jesus went up a mountain, and called to him whom he would, and they went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he selected twelve, that they might attend him, and that he might commission them to make proclamation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>empowering them to cure disease; and to expel demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These were Simon, whom he surnamed Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and James, son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James. These he surnamed Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then they went into a house, whither a crowd again assembled, so that Jesus and his disciples could not so such as eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His kinsmen hearing this, went out to restrain it, (for they said, He is beside himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the scribes who came from Jerusalem, said, He is confederate with Beelzebub, and expels demons by the prince of demons.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus having called them, said to them by similitudes, How can Satan expel Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If a kingdom be torn by factions, that kingdom can not subsist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if a family be torn by factions, that family can not subsist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus, if Satan fight against himself, and be divided, he can not subsist, but is near his end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No one who enters the strong one's house, can plunder his goods, unless he first overpower the strong one; then, indeed, he may plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Indeed, I say to you, that though all other sins in the sons of men are pardonable, and whatever slanders they shall utter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>whosoever shall speak slanderously against the Holy Spirit, shall never be pardoned, but be liable to eternal punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He said this because they affirmed he was leagued with an unclean spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Meanwhile came his mother and brothers, who standing without, sent for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the crowd who sat round him, said to him, Lo, your mother and brothers are without, and seek you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking about on those who sat around him, he said, Behold my mother and my brothers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for whosoever does the will of God, is my brother, my sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
