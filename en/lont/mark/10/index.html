Again multitudes resorted to him; and again, as his custom was, he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And some Pharisees came, who, to try him, asked him, Is it lawful for the husband to divorce his wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He answering, said to them, What precept has Moses given you on this subject?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They replied, Moses has permitted us to write her a bill of divorcement, and dismiss her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answering, said to them, Because of your intractable disposition, Moses gave you this permission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But from the beginning, at the creation, God made them a male and a female.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall adhere to his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and they two shall be one flesh. They are, therefore, not longer two, but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then God has conjoined, let no man separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, in the house, his disciples asked him anew concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said to them, Whosoever divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and if a woman divorce her husband, and marry another, she commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they brought children to him, that he might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus perceiving this, was offended, and said, Allow the children to come to me, do not hinder them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Indeed, I say to you, whosoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall never enter it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then taking them up in his arms, and laying his hands upon them, he blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As he went out into the road, one came running to him, who, kneeling, asked him, Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus answered, Why do you call me good? God alone is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do you know the commandments? Do not commit adultery; do not commit murder; do not steal; do not give false testimony; do no injury; honor your father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The other replied, Rabbi, I have observed all these from my childhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus, looking upon him, loved him, and said to him, In one thing, nevertheless, you are deficient. Go, sell all that you have, and give the price to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; then come, and follow me, carrying the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he was troubled at this answer, and went away sorrowful; for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus looking around him, said to his disciples, How difficult it is for the wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciples were astonished at his words; but Jesus resuming the discourse, said, Children, how difficult is it for them, who confide in wealth, to enter the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At this they were still more amazed, and said one to another, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus looking upon them, said, To men it is impossible, but not to God; for to God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter took occasion to say, As for us, we have forsaken all, and followed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answering, said, Indeed, I say to you, there is none who shall have forsaken his house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, for my sake and the gospel's;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive now, in this world, a hundred fold; houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the future state, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many shall be first, who are last, and last, who are first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As they were on the road to Jerusalem, Jesus walking before them, a panic seized them, and they followed him with terror. Then taking the twelve aside, he told them again what would befall him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, says he, we are going to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man shall be delivered to the chief priests, who will condemn him to die, and deliver him to the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>who will mock him, and scourge him, and spit upon him, and kill him; but the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, accosted him, saying, Rabbi, we beg you would grant us what we purpose to ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said to them, what would you have me grant you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They answered, That when you shall have attained your glory, one of us may sit at your right hand, and the other at your left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus replied, You know not what you ask. Can you drink such a cup as I am to drink; and undergo an immersion like that which I must undergo?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered, We can. Jesus said to them, You shall indeed drink such a cup, as I am to drink, and undergo an immersion like that which I must undergo;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but to sit at my right hand, and left, I can not give, unless to those for whom it is appointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The ten hearing this, conceived indignation against James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But Jesus having called them together, said to them, You know that those who are accounted the princes of the nations, domineer over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but it must not be so amongst you. On the contrary, whosoever would be great amongst you, shall be your servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whosoever would be the chief, shall be the slave of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For even the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then they came to Jericho. Afterward, as he was departing thence, with his disciples, and a great crowd, blind Bartimeus, son of Timeus, who sat by the way-side begging,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, cried, saying, Jesus Son of David, have pity upon me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Many charged him to be silent, but he cried still the louder, Son of David, have pity upon me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus stopping, ordered them to call him. Accordingly they called the blind man, saying to him, Take courage; arise, he calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then throwing down his mantle, he sprang up, and went to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus addressing him, said, What do you wish me to do for you? Rabboni, answered the blind man, to give me my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus said to him, Go; your faith has cured you. Immediately he recovered his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
