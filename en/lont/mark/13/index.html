They shall be so razed, that one stone will not be left upon another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Afterward, as he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, opposite the temple, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, asked him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell us, when will this happen? and what will be the sign, when all this is to be accomplished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answering them, took occasion to say, Take heed that no man seduce you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>for many will assume my character, saying, I am the person, and will seduce many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, be not alarmed; for this must happen, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be earthquakes in sundry places, and there will be famines and commotions. These are the prelude of woes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But take heed to yourselves; for they will deliver you to councils; and you will be beaten in the synagogues, and brought before governors and kings for my sake, to bear testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The good tidings, however, must first be published among all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they conduct you, to deliver you up, have no anxiety beforehand, nor premeditate what you shall speak: but whatever shall be suggested to you in that moment, speak; for it is not you that shall speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the brother will deliver up the brother to death; and the father the child; and children will arise against their parents, and procure their death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And on my account you shall be universally hated; but the man who perseveres to the end, shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when you shall see standing on forbidden ground, the desolating abomination, (reader, attend!) then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and let not him who shall be on the roof, go down into the house, nor enter it, to carry anything out of his house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and let not him who shall be in the field, turn back to fetch his mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But alas for the women with child, and for them who give suck in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray, then, that your flight happen not in the winter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because there shall be such affliction in those days, as has not been before, from the beginning of the world, which God created, nor shall be ever after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Had the Lord assigned it a long duration, no soul could escape; but for the sake of the people whom he had elected, he has made its duration the shorter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then if any one shall say to you, Lo! the Messiah is here, or Lo! he is yonder, believe it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For false Messiahs and false prophets will arise, who will perform wonders and prodigies, in order to impose, if possible, even on the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be you, therefore, upon your guard: remember, I have warned you of everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in those days, after that affliction, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall withhold her light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the stars of heaven shall fall; and the powers which are in heaven shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he will send his messengers, and assemble his elect from the four quarters of the world, from the extremities of heaven and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Learn now a similitude from the fig tree. When its branches become tender, and put forth leaves, you know that the summer is nigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In like manner, when you shall see these things happen, know that he is near, even at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Indeed, I say to you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For heaven and earth shall fail: but my words shall not fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But of that day, or of that hour, knows none, (not the angels; no, not the Son,) but the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Be circumspect, be vigilant, and pray; for you know not when that time will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When a man intends to travel, he leaves his household in charge to his servants, assigns to every one his task, and orders the porter to watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Watch you, therefore; for you know not when the master of the house will return, (whether in the evening, or at midnight, or at cock-crowing, or in the morning;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>lest coming suddenly, he find you asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now what I say to you, I say to all, Watch.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
