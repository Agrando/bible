And the chief priests and the scribes were contriving how they might take Jesus by surprise, and kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They said, however, Not during the festival, for fear of an insurrection among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now being at table in Bethany, in the house of Simon, formerly a leper, there came a woman with an alabaster box of the balsam of spikenard, which was very costly; and she broken open the box, and poured the liquor upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There were some present, who said with indignation, Why this profusion of the balsam?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, which might have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said, Let her alone. Why do you molest her? She has done me a good office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For you will have the poor always amongst you, and can do them good whenever you please; but me you will not always have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has done what she could. She has beforehand embalmed my body for the funeral.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Indeed, I say to you, in whatsoever corner of the world the glad tidings shall be proclaimed, what this woman has now done, shall be mentioned to her honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, repaired to the chief priests, to betray Jesus to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they listened to him with joy, and promised to give him money. Afterward he sought a favorable opportunity to deliver him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the first day of unleavened bread, when the passover is sacrificed, his disciples said to him, Whither shall we go to prepare for your eating the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, Go into the city, where you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and wherever he shall enter, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is the guest chamber, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will show you a large upper room ready furnished. There prepare for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Accordingly, his disciples went away, and being come into the city, found everything as he had told them, and prepared the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the evening he went thither with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As they were at table eating, Jesus said, Indeed, I say to you, that one of you who eats with me, will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Upon this they became very sorrowful; and asked him, all of them, one after another, Is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He answering, said to them, It is one of the twelve; he who dips his morsel in the dish with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Son of Man departs in the manner foretold in the scripture concerning him; but alas for that man! by whom the Son of Man is betrayed: it had been better for that man never to have been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and after blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, Take; this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he took the cup, and having given thanks, gave it to them; and they all drank of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, This is my blood, the blood of the new institution, shed for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Indeed, I say to you, that I will drink no more of the product of the vine, till that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after the hymn, they went to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>«And Jesus said to them, This night I shall prove a stumbling stone to you all; for it is written,'I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nevertheless, after I am raised again, I will go before you to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Peter then said to him, Though they all should stumble, I never will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered him, Indeed, I say to you, that today, this very night, before the cock crow twice, even you will disown me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Peter insisted on it, adding, Although I should die with you, I will never disown you. And all the rest said the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then they came to a place named Gethsemane, where he said to his disciples, Stay here while I pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took with him Peter, and James, and John, and being seized with grief and horror,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>said to them, My soul is overwhelmed with a deadly anguish; tarry here and watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And going a little before, he threw himself on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, he might be delivered from that hour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and said, Abba, (that is, Father,) all things are possible to thee; take this cup away from me; yet not what I would, but what thou wilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he returned, and finding them asleep, said to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Could you not keep awake a single hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Watch and pray, that you be not overcome by temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again, he retired and prayed, using the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When he returned, he again found them sleeping; for their eyes were overpowered, and they knew not what to answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>A third time he came, and said to them, Do you now sleep, and take your rest? All is over: the hour is come: and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Arise. Let us be going. Lo! he who betrays me is drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Immediately, before he had done speaking, appeared Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude armed with swords and clubs, who were sent by the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now the betrayer had given them this signal: The man whom I shall kiss, is he; seize him, and lead him away safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He was no sooner come, than accosting Jesus, he said, Rabbi, Rabbi, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then they laid hands on him and seized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But one of those who were present, drew his sword, and smiting the high priest's servant, cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then Jesus addressing them, said, Do you come with swords and clubs to apprehend me, like people in pursuit of a robber?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I was daily amongst you, teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me. But in this the scriptures are accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then they all forsook him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Now there followed him a youth, who had only a linen cloth wrapped about his body; the soldiers having laid hold of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>he left the cloth, and fled from them naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then they took Jesus away to the high priest, with whom all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes, were convened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the court of the high priest's house, and sat there with the officers, warming himself at the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Meanwhile, the chief priests, and all the Sanhedrin, sought for evidence against Jesus, in order to condemn him to die, but found none:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>for many gave false testimony against him, but their testimonies were insufficient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The some arose, who testified falsely against him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>We heard him say, I will demolish this temple made with hands, and in three days will build another without hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>But even here their testimony was defective.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Then the high priest, standing up in the midst, interrogated Jesus, saying, Do you answer nothing to what these men testify against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he was silent, and gave no answer. Again, the high priest interrogating him, said, Are you the Messiah, the Son of the blessed One?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus answered, I am; nay, you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, What further need have we of witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>You have heard the blasphemy. What is your opinion? And they all pronounced him worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then some began to spit on him; others to cover his face and buffet him, saying to him, Divine who it is. And the officers gave him blows on the cheeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Now Peter being below in the court, one of the maids of the high priest came thither,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>who seeing Peter warming himself, looked on him, and said, You also were with the Nazarene Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied it, saying, I know him not: nor do I understand what you mean. Immediately he went out into the portico, and the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>The maid seeing him again, said to the bystanders, This is one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Again he denied. And a little after, those who were present said to Peter, You are certainly one of them; for you are a Galilean, your speech shows it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Upon this he affirmed, with imprecations, and oaths, that he did not know the man of whom they spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>The cock crew the second time: and Peter recollected the word which Jesus had said to him, Before the cock crow twice, you will disown me thrice. And reflecting upon this, he wept.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
