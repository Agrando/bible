They said, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then commanding the multitude to place themselves upon the ground, he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples, that they might distribute them to the people, and they distributed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They had also a few small fishes, which, after blessing, he likewise ordered to be presented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they eat, and were satisfied; and the fragments which remained, were carried off in seven hand-baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now they who had eat were about four thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Having dismissed them, he immediately embarked with his disciples, and went into the territory of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thence some Pharisees came, who began to argue with him; and in order to prove him, demanded of him a sign in the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus answered with a deep groan, Wherefore does this generation require a sign? Indeed, I say to you, that no sign shall be given to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After that, leaving them, he re-embarked and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the disciples had forgot to bring bread, having only one loaf with them in the bark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jesus gave them this caution: Attend; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They reflecting upon it, said among themselves, It is because we have no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus remarking it, said to them, Why do you make this reflection, hat you have no bread? Are you yet so thoughtless, so inattentive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is your understanding still blinded? Have you no us of your eyes, or of your ears? or do you not remember</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>when I distributed the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you carry off? They answered, Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the seven among four thousand, how many hand-baskets full of the fragments did you carry off? They said, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How then is it, proceeded he, that you do not apprehend me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When Jesus came to Bethsaida, they brought to him a blind man, whom they entreated him to touch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village. Then having put spittle on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him whether he saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Having looked up, he said, I see men, as trees walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus laid his hands upon the man's eyes, and made him look again. And he was so perfectly cured, as to see every object clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jesus sent him home, saying, Neither go into the village, nor tell anything to any of the villagers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus went thence with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and by the way asked them, saying, Who do men say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They answered, John the Immerser; but some say, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answering, said to him, You are the Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he charged them to tell no person this concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he began to inform them, that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and that in three days he must rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This he spoke so plainly, that Peter, taking him aside, reproved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he turning, and looking on his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Get you hence, adversary, for you do not relish the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then having called both to the people, and to his disciples, he said, Is any willing to come under my guidance? Let him renounce himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life, for my sake and the gospel's, shall save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What would it profit a man, if he should gain the whole world, with the forfeit of his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>or what will a man not give in ransom for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him likewise the Son of man will be ashamed, when he shall come in the glory of his Father, accompanied by the holy angels.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
