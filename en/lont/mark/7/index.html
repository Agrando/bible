And in many other instances you act thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then having called the whole multitude, he said to them, Hearken to me all of you, and be instructed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing from without, which entering into the man, can pollute him; but the things which proceed from within the man, are the things that pollute him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When he had withdrawn from the people into a house, his disciples asked him the meaning of that sentence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He answered, Are you also void of understanding? Do you not perceive, that whatsoever from without enters into the man, can not pollute him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because it enters not into his heart, but into his stomach, whence all impurities in the victuals pass into the sink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, added he, that which proceeds out of the man, is what pollutes the man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for from within the human heart proceed vicious machinations, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>insatiable desires, malevolence, fraud, immodesty, envy, calumny, arrogance, levity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evils issue from within, and pollute the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he arose, and went to the frontiers of Tyre and Sidon; and having entered a house, he desired that none might know of him; but he could not be concealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, hearing of him, came and threw herself at his feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>(the woman was a Greek, a native of Syrophenicia,) and entreated him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus answered, Let the children first be satisfied; for it is not seemly to take the children bread, and throw it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>She replied, True, Sir; yet even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said to her, For this answer go home; the demon is gone out of your daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Immediately she went home, and found her daughter lying upon the bed, and freed from the demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then leaving the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he returned to the sea of Galilee, through the precincts of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they brought to him a deaf man, who had also an impediment in his speech, and entreated him to lay his hand upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus having taken him aside from the crowd, spit upon his own fingers, and put them into the man's ears, and touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then looking up to heaven, and sighing, he said, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Immediately his ears were opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke distinctly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He charged them to tell no person: but the more he charged them, the more they published it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>saying with inexpressible amazement, He does everything well: he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
