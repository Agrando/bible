If any one offend not in the word, he is a perfect man, able to rule, also, the whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, we put bits into the mouths of horses, to make them obedient to us, and we turn about their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, also, the ships, which, though they be so great, and are driven by fierce winds, are turned about by a very small helm, whithersoever the power of the pilot determines:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>so, also, the tongue is a little member, yet it works mightily. Behold, how much wood a little fire kindles!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now the tongue is a fire-a world of iniquity; the tongue is so placed among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets the wheel of nature in a blaze, and is set on fire from hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now every species of wild beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of sea monsters, is subdued, and has been subdued by man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but the tongue of men, no one can subdue; it is an unruly evil thing, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless God, even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made in the likeness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth proceed a blessing and a curse! My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a fountain send forth, from the same opening, sweet water and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig-tree, my brethren, produces olives; or a vine, figs? So, no fountain can yield salt water and fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is any one wise and intelligent among you? let him show, by good behavior, his works, with meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter anger and strife in your heart, do you not boast and lie against the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This is not the wisdom which comes from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for where there is anger and strife, there is disorder, and every evil work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom from above is, indeed, first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be persuaded, full of compassion and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace, by them who practice peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
