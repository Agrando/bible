You have heaped up treasure in the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hark! the hire of the laborers who have reaped your field, which is fraudulently kept back by you, cries; and the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have lived luxuriously on the earth, and been wanton; you have nourished your hearts as in a day of festivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have condemned-you have killed the Just One-he did not resist you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold the husbandman, who expects the valuable fruit of the earth, waits patiently for it, till it receive the early and later rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be you also patient-strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws nigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Repine not against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned: behold, the Judge stands before the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord: for an example of suffering evil, and of patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, we call them happy, who are patient. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, above all things, my brethren, swear not; neither by the heaven, or by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yes, be Yes, and your no, No; that you may not fall under condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Does any one among you suffer evil? let him pray: is any one cheerful? let him sing psalms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any one sick, among you? let him send for the seniors of the congregation, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil, in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the prayer of faith will save the sick person, and so the Lord will raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess your faults, one to another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed.
