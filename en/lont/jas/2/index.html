Can faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if a brother or a sister be naked, or destitute of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and any one of you say to him, Depart in peace: be warmed, and be filled; yet give him none of the things needful for the body, what is the advantage?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So, also, faith, if it have not works, is dead, being alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Also, one may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that there is one God; you do well: even the demons believe and tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Besides, would you know, O vain man, that faith, without works, is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham, our father, justified by works, when he had lifted up Isaac, his son, upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see that his faith co-operated with his works, and by works his faith was perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>«And so that scripture was fulfilled, which says,» 'Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see, that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in like manner, also, was not Rahab, the harlot, justified by works, having secretly received the messengers, and having sent them away by another road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For, as the body, without the spirit, is dead, so, also, faith, without works, is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
