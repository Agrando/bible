Do they not come hence, even from your lusts, which war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You strongly desire, and have not; you kill, and are zealous, and can not obtain. You fight and war, but have not, because you ask not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask, and do not receive, because you ask wickedly, that you may spend upon your lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Adulterers, and adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity against God? Whosoever, therefore, will be a friend of the world, is counted an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do you think that the scripture speaks in vain? And does the spirit, who dwells in us, strongly incline to envy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>«But he gives greater favor. For it says,» 'God resists the proud, but gives favor to the humble.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, be subject to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you men of two minds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be exceedingly afflicted, and mourn, and weep; and let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into sadness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be humble in the presence of the Lord, and he will lift you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who speaks against his brother, and condemns his brother, speaks against the law, and condemns the law. But if you condemn the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one lawgiver, who is able to save, and to destroy. Who are you, that condemn another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come, now, you who say, Today, or to-morrow, we will go to such a city, and will abide there one year, and traffic in merchandise, and get gain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who do not know what shall be to-morrow. For what is your life? It is, indeed, a smoke, which appears for a little while, and then vanishes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead of which, you ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you boast in your proud speeches: all such boasting is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wherefore, to him who know how to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
