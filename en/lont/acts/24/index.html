have been for several years a judge to this nation, I answer for myself with the more cheerfulness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>since you may know that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they neither found me disputing with any man in the temple, nor making any insurrection among the people, either in the synagogues, or in the city:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>nor can they produce any proof of the things concerning which they now accuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call a sect, so worship I the God of our fathers; believing all things which are written in the law, and in the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>having hope toward God, of that which they themselves also expect, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And upon this account, I exercise myself to have always a conscience without offense toward God, and toward men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, after several years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>upon which some Asiatic Jews found me purified in the temple; neither with multitude nor with tumult;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who ought to have been present before you, and to accuse me, if they had anything against me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>or let these themselves say, if, when I stood before the Sanhedrim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>they found any crime in me; unless it be with relation to this one word, which I expressed, when I stood among them-that, for the resurrection of the dead, I am judged by you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Felix heard these things, he put them off, saying, After I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias, the commander, comes down, I will take cognizance of the affair between you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and let him have liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting him, or coming to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, after some days, Felix, coming the Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he reasoned concerning righteousness and temperance, and judgment to come, Felix, trembling, answered, Go your way for this time, and I will take some future opportunity to call for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he hoped, also, that money would be given him by Paul, that he might be set at liberty: and, therefore, he sent the more frequently for him, and discoursed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now, after two years were ended, Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus; and Felix, willing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, left Paul a prisoner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
