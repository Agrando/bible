The multitude must, by all means, come together; for they will hear that you are come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore, do this that we say to you: there are with us four men who have a vow upon them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>take them, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know that there is nothing in those things which they have heard of you; but that you yourself walk regularly, keeping the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As for the believing Gentiles, we have written, determining that they should observe none of these things; except it be to keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from that which is strangled, and from fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and the next day, being purified with them, entered into the temple, declaring the accomplishment of the days of purification, till an offering should be offered for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But as the seven days were about to be accomplished, the Jews that were from Asia, seeing him in the temple, threw all the populace into confusion, and laid hands upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>crying out, Israelites, help! This is the man that everywhere teaches all men contrary to the people, and to the law, and to this place; and has even brought Greeks into the temple, and polluted this holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For they had been seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the city with him, whom they imagined that Paul had brought into the temple.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people; and laying hold of Paul, they dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the gates were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they went about to kill him, word was brought to the commander of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in confusion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who immediately took soldiers, and centurions, and ran in among them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they ceased from beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the commander drew near, and took him; and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was, and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And some among the multitude cried out one thing, and some another: and as he could not know the certainty, by reason of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But when he was upon the stairs, it came to pass that he was borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the multitude of the people followed, crying out, Away with him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But as Paul was going to be brought into the castle, he said to the commander, May I be allowed to speak to you? And he said, Can you speak Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Are you not that Egyptian, who did, before these days, stir up a sedition, and led out into the wilderness four thousand murderers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, I am indeed a Jew, of Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no inconsiderable city; and I entreat you, permit me to speak to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And on his giving permission, Paul standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people; and when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, saying:</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
