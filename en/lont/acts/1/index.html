This Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall also come in the same manner as you have seen him going to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem, from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day's journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they were come into the city, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, son of Alpheus, and Simon, the Zealot, and Judas, brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These all unanimously persevered in prayer, with the women, and with Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in these days, Peter, rising up in the midst of the disciples, (now the number of persons assembled was about a hundred and twenty,) said</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Brethren, it was necessary this scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit formerly spoke, by the mouth of David, with respect to Judas, who became the guide of those that apprehended Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(for he was numbered with us, and had obtained a part of this ministry:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>this man, therefore, purchased a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling down on his face, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and it was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that field is called, in their language, Aceldama, that is, The Field of Blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>«For it is written in the book of Psalms,'Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell in it': and,» 'Let another take his office.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is necessary, therefore, that one of the men who have continued with us all the time the Lord Jesus was conversant among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>commencing from his immersion by John, until the day of his assumption, should be constituted a witness with us, of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they set up two men, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed, saying, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, show which of these two thou hast chosen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that he may take part of the ministry and apostleship, from which Judas fell by transgression, that he might goes to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven Apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
