And she compelled us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now it came to pass, that as we were going to the oratory, we were met by a certain maid-servant that had a spirit of divination, who brought her owners much gain by prophesying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the same, following after Paul and us, cried out, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who declare to you the way of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this she did for several days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I charge you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out of her. And it went out that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when her owners saw that the hope of their gain was gone; laying hold of Paul and Silas, they dragged them to the market place, to the magistrates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and having brought them to the generals of the army, they said, These men, who are Jews, mightily disturb our city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and teach customs, which it is not lawful for us to receive and practice, being Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the populace rose up together against them; and the generals tearing off their garments, commanded them to be beaten with rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who, having received such a strict charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet fast in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But at midnight, Paul and Silas having prayed, sung a hymn to God: and the prisoners heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, on a sudden, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prisoner were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all the prisoners were loosed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the jailor, awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword, and was going to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners were fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul cried out, with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he called for lights, and sprung in; and, being in a tremor, fell down before Paul and Silas;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and, bringing them out, he said, O Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And taking them, that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes; and was immediately immersed, himself, and all his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having brought them into his house, he spread the table before them: and believing in the God, with all his house, he was transported with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Dismiss those men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the keeper of the prison told these things to Paul, The generals have sent that you may be dismissed; now, therefore, go out, and pursue your journey in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul said to them, They have beaten us, who are Romans, publicly and uncondemned, and have cast us into prison; and do they now thrust us out privately? By no means: but let them come themselves, and conduct us out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the sergeants reported these words to the generals. And when they had heard that they were Romans, they were afraid:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and they came and comforted them; and conducting them out, requested that they would depart from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And coming out of the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
