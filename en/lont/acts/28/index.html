And after one day the south wind arising, we came, in two days, to Puteoli:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>where we found brethren, and were entreated to stay with them seven days: and so we went for Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from thence, the brethren, having heard of our affairs, came out to meet us, as far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns: whom, when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the band: but Paul was permitted to dwell apart, in a house of his own, with a soldier that guarded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, that, after three days, Paul called together those that were the chief of the Jews. And when they were come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing contrary to the people, nor to our paternal customs, yet I was delivered a prisoner, from Jerusalem, into the hands of the Romans;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who, having examined me, were willing to have set me at liberty, as there was no cause of death in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when the Jews opposed, I was obliged to appeal to Cesar; not as having anything of which to accuse my own nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For this reason, therefore, I entreated, that I might see and speak with you; for on account of the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you; nor have any of the brethren, that have come hither, related, or said, any evil concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we desire to hear from you, what you think; for as concerning this sect, we know that it everywhere spoken against.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them of the things that relate to Jesus; both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning till evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken; and some believed not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And disagreeing with each other, they broke up the assembly: Paul saying this one word, Surely, well did the Holy Spirit speak, by Isaiah the prophet, to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>«when he said,» 'Go to this people and say, Hearing you will hear, and will not understand; and seeing you will see, and will not perceive:'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>«for the heart of this people is become gross, and with their ears they hear heavily; and they have drawn their eyes together, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore be it known to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having great debates among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Paul continued two whole years in his own hired house, and received all who came to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>announcing the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which relate to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, and without any restraint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
