and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius, of Derbe, and Timothy: and of the Asiatics, Tychicus and Trophimus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These, going before, staid for us at Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And we set sail from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we continued seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And on the first day of the week, when the disciples met together to break bread, Paul, being about to depart on the morrow, discoursed to them, and continued his speech until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were many lamps in the upper room, in which we were assembled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and a certain young man, whose name was Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a profound sleep: and as Paul continued his discourse a long time, he was so overpowered with sleep that he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Paul went down, and fell upon him, and taking him in his arms, said, Do not make any disturbance, for his life is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And going up again, and having broken bread, and eaten, he conversed a considerable time, even till break of day, and so departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they brought the youth alive, and were not a little comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we went before into the ship, and sailed to Assos, where we are to take up Paul, for so he had appointed, choosing himself to go on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as soon as he joined us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And sailing thence, we came the next day over against Chios; and the day following, we touched at Samos, and having staid at Trogyllium, we came the day after to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend any time in Asia; for he earnestly endeavored, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, sending to Ephesus, from Miletus, he called thither the elders of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they were come to him, he said to them, You know how I have been conversant among you all the time, from the first day in which I entered into Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving the Lord, with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befell me by the ambushes of the Jews:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how I have suppressed nothing that was advantageous, not neglecting to announce to you, and to teach you publicly and privately;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>testifying both to the Jews and Greeks, reformation with respect to God, and faith with respect to our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound by the Spirit, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I make no account of any of these things, nor do I regard even life itself; so that I may but joyfully finish my course, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, even to testify the good news of the favor of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, behold, I know that you all, with whom I have conversed, proclaiming the kingdom of God, shall not see my face any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Wherefore, I testify to you this day, that I am clear from the blood of all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I have not declined to declare to you all the counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, take heed to yourselves, and to the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has constituted you overseers; to feed the congregation of the Lord, which he has redeemed with his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know this, that after my departure, grievous wolves will enter in among you, having no mercy on the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yes, from among your own selves men shall arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Watch, therefore, remembering that for the space of three years, I ceased not to warn every one, night and day, with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now, brethren, I recommend you to God, and to the word of his favor, who is able to edify you, and to give you an inheritance among all that are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yes, you yourselves know, that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those that were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have showed you all things; how, that thus laboring, you ought to assist the infirm, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is much happier to give than to receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And having said these things, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there was great lamentation among them all: and falling upon Paul's neck, they kissed him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>especially grieving for that word which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they conducted him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
