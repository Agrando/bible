And he said to him, Throw your mantle round you, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And going out he followed him; and he did not know that what was done by the messenger was real; but supposed that he had seen a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And passing through the first and second watch, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city; which opened to them of its own accord. And going out, they went through one street, and immediately the messenger departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Peter, being come to himself, said, Now I know truly, that the Lord has sent his messenger, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from all the expectations of the Jewish people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And recollecting, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark; where many were gathered together, praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And as Peter knocked at the door of the outer gate, a maiden, whose name was Rose, went to inquire who was there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And knowing Peter's voice, transported with joy, she did not open the gate: but running in, told them that Peter was standing at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they said to her, You are distracted: but she confidently affirmed that it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter continued knocking; and when she opened the door, they saw him, and were astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he made a sign to them with his hand to be silent; and related to them how the Lord had conducted him out of prison. And he aid, Inform James and the brethren of these things: and departing, he went to another place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as soon as it was day, there was no small tumult among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Herod searching for him, and not finding him, examined the keeper, and ordered them to be led away to execution. and passing from Judea to Caesarea, he abode there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he was highly incensed against the Tyrians and Sidonians; but they unanimously came before him; and gaining Blastus, the king's chamberlain, to their interest, they begged for peace; because their country was nourished by that of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And upon a set day, Herod, being arrayed in a royal habit, and seated upon the throne, made an oration to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people cried out, It is the voice of a God, and not of a man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But immediately a messenger of the Lord smote him, because he did not give glory to God: and being eaten with worms, he expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the word of God grew and was multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabas and Saul, having fulfilled their ministry, returned from Jerusalem; bringing along with them John, whose surname was Mark.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
