Then Paul, stretching forth his hand, made his defense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I esteem myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am this day to make my defense before you, concerning all those things of which I am accused by the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>especially as you are acquainted with all the customs and questions among the Jews: wherefore, I entreat you, that you will hear me with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The manner of my life, from my youth, which, from the beginning, was spent among my own nation, in Jerusalem, is known to all the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who knew me from the first, (if they would testify,) that, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now I stand in judgment for the hope of that promise, which was made by God to our fathers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to which promise, our twelve tribes, worshiping continually, night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why should it be judged an incredible thing, by you, that God should raise the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I, indeed, thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Which, accordingly, I did in Jerusalem; and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests. And when some of them were killed, I gave my vote against them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and frequently punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>With this view, I was going to Damascus, with authority and commission from the chief priests;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>at mid-day, on the road, King Agrippa, I saw a light from heaven, exceeding the splendor of the sun, shining about me, and those who traveled with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying, in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But arise, and stand upon your feet, for to this purpose I have appeared to you, to ordain you a minister and a witness, both of the things which you have seen, and of those which I will hereafter show you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles; to whom I now send you-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive forgiveness of sons, and an inheritance amongst the sanctified, through faith in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From that time, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but declared, first to them at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea; and then to the Gentiles, that they should reform, and return to God, performing deeds worthy of reformation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>On account of these things, the Jews seizing me in the temple, attempted to have killed me with their own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I continue, till this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses have declared would be;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the Messiah would be a sufferer-would be first of a resurrection from the dead-would give light to the people, and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as he was thus making his defense, Festus said, with a loud voice, Paul, you are distracted: much learning drives you to madness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he replied, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but utter the words of truth and soberness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the king knows of these things; to whom, also, I speak with freedom: for I am persuaded none of these things are hid from him, for this was not done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa! do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Agrippa said to Paul, You almost persuade me to be a Christian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paul said, I would to God that, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as he said this, the king arose, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had retired, they spoke one with another, saying, This man has done nothing worthy of death, or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cesar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
