For do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet, in violation of the law, command me to be struck?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they, that stood by, said, Do you revile the high priest of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>«And Paul said, Brethren, I was not aware that it was the high priest; for it is written,» 'You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Paul, perceiving that the one part was Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out, in the Sanhedrim, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope and resurrection of the dead, I am brought into judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And on speaking this, there was a contention between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there was a great clamor; and the scribes who were on the side of the Pharisees, arose and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit, or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as a great disturbance arose, the commander, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down, and take him by force from the midst of them, and to bring him into the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And in the following night, the Lord, standing by him, said, Be of good courage, Paul; for as you have testified the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear testimony in Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when it was day, some of the Jews, entering into a conspiracy, bound themselves with a curse; saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they were more than forty, who had made this agreement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves m by a solemn anathema, not to taste anything till we have slain Paul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>now, therefore, do you, with the Sanhedrim, signify to the commander, that he bring him down to you, as if you would more accurately discuss what relates to him; and we are ready to kill him, before he can come near you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came, and entering into the castle, told Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Paul, calling one of the centurions to him, said, Conduct this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He, therefore, took and led him to the commander, and said, Paul, the prisoner, calling me to him, desired that I would bring to you this young man, who has something to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the commander, taking him by the hand, and leading him into a retired place, inquired of him, What is it that you have to tell me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, The Jews have agreed together to ask you, that you bring down Paul to-morrow to the Sanhedrim, as if they would inquire something more accurately concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But do not be prevailed on by them; for there are more than forty of them, that lie in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by a curse, neither to eat nor drink, till they have killed him; and they are now ready, expecting this promise from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The commander, therefore, dismissed the young man, with a charge, Be sure you tell no man, that you have discovered these things to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he called too him two of the centurions, and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers, to go to Caesarea; and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen; by the third hour of the night;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and provide beasts to set Paul upon, and conduct him in safety to Felix, the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he wrote an epistle, the contents of which are in this copy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Claudius Lysias, to his excellency, Felix, the governor, sends greeting:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man was seized by the Jews, and had like to have been slain by them; when I came with a party of soldiers, and rescued him: and I have since learned, that he is a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And, desiring to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him before the Sanhedrim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law, but to have nothing charged upon him worthy of death, or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when it was signified to me, that an ambush would be laid for the man, by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, commanding his accusers also to declare before you, what they have against him. Farewell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The soldiers, therefore, as it was commanded them, taking up Paul, brought him by night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the next day they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who, entering into Caesarea, and delivering the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he had read the letter, he asked of what province he was: and being informed that he was of Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I will hear you, said he, when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's praetorium.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
