And at that time there was a great persecution against the congregation in Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the regions of Judea, and Samaria, except the Apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And devout men carried away Stephen, and made great lamentation for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul made havoc of the congregation, entering into houses, and dragging men and whom, whom he committed to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless, they who were dispersed, went about declaring the glad tidings of the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then came Philip to the city of Samaria, and announced the Messiah to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the people unanimously attended to the things that were spoken by Philip; as they heard them, and saw the miracles which he performed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For, unclean spirits, which had possessed many, crying with a loud voice, came out of them; and many, who were paralytic and lame, were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But there was a certain man named Simon, who had, before, in that city, used magic, and astonished the nation of Samaria; pretending himself to be some extraordinary person:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to whom they all paid regard, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they paid regard to him; because he had, for a long time, astonished them wit his enchantments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they gave credit to Philip, declaring the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ: they were immersed, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Simon himself also believed; and being immersed, he kept near to Philip, beholding with amazement, the great and powerful miracles which were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the Apostles, who were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who, going down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(For he was not yet fallen on any of them; only, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given by the imposition of the Apostles' hands, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, Let your money go with you to destruction, since you have thought that the free gift of God might be purchased with money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have no part nor lot in this matter; for your heart is not upright in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Reform, therefore, from this your wickedness; and beg of God, if, indeed, the thought of your heart may be forgiven you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Simon answered, and said, Make your supplications to the Lord on my behalf; that none of these things which you have spoken, may come upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now when they had borne their testimony, and had spoke the word of the Lord, they turned back for Jerusalem; and declared the glad tidings in many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And a messenger of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south, by the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he arose, and took his journey; and, behold, a certain Ethiopian officer, a grandee of Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians, that was over all her treasure, who had come to worship at Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>was returning, and sat in his chariot, reading the Prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Spirit said to Philip, Approach, and join yourself to this chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Philip, running up, heard him read in the Prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, How can I, unless some one should guide me? And he requested Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>«Now the passage of scripture which he was reading, was this,» 'He was brought to the slaughter, as a sheep; and as a lamb before its shearer, is dumb; so he opened not his mouth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>«In his humiliation his condemnation was extorted; and who shall describe his generation? for his life is cut off from the earth.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The officer answering Philip, said, I beseech you, of whom does the prophet say this? -of himself, or of some other person?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from the scripture, told him the glad tidings concerning Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went along the way, they came to a certain water, and the officer said, Behold, water; what hinders my being immersed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>OMITTED TEXT</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the officer; and he immersed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord suddenly conveyed away Philip, and the officer saw him no more: so he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found at Azotus; and going on thence, he proclaimed the glad tidings in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
