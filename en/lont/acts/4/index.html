for that indeed a signal miracle has been wrought by them, is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and we can not deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless, that it may not spread any further among the people, let us charge them, with the severest threats, to speak no more to any man in this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And having called them, they charged them neither to speak nor teach any more in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John, answering them, said, Whether it be just in the sight of God, to obey you rather than God, judge you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for we can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having threatened them again, they dismissed them, on account of the people, finding nothing for which they might punish them; because all the people glorified God for that which was done;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for the man on whom this miracle of healing was wrought, was more than forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being dismissed, they came to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, thou art the God who didst make heaven and earth; and the sea, and all things that are in them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>«who didst say by the mouth of thy servant David,» 'Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>«The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers combined together against the Lord, and against his anointed.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For of a truth, against thy holy Son Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the heathen, and the people of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>have combined to do what thy hand and thy counsel marked out before to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, O Lord, regard their threatenings; and give to thy servants to speak thy word with all freedom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>whilst thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and signs and wonders are doing through the name of thy holy Son Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And while they were praying, the place in which they were assembled was shaken: and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with freedom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the heart and soul of the multitude of believers was one: nor did any one call any of his possessions his own; but all things were common among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power did the Apostles give forth their testimony concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great kindness was among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Neither was there one indigent person among them; for as many as were proprietors of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the price of the things they sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and laid it down at the feet of the Apostles: and distribution was made to each according to his need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joses, who, by the Apostles, was surnamed Barnabas, (which being interpreted, signifies a Son of Exhortation,) a Levite, and by birth a Cyprian,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>having an estate, sold it, and brought the money and laid it down at the feet of the Apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
