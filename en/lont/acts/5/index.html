Why have you admitted this thing into your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired: and great fear fell on all that heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the young men arose, and bound him up, and carrying him out, they buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After the interval of about three hours, his wife, also, not knowing what was done, came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Peter said to her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have conspired together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold the feet of those who have been burying your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And immediately she fell down at his feet, and expired: and the young men coming in, found her dead, and carried her out, and buried her by her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear came on all the assembly, and on all that heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the Apostles, (and they were all unanimously in Solomon's portico;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and not one of the rest presumed to join himself to them, but the people magnified them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and believers were more and more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>insomuch that along the streets they brought out the sick, and laid them on beds, and couches, that even the shadow of Peter, coming by, might overshadow some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And multitudes also, out of the cities round about, came together to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and those that were troubled with unclean spirits, who were all healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the high priest arising, and all they that were him, being the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with zeal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and laid their hands on the Apostles, and put them into the common prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But a messenger of the Lord, by night, opened the doors of the prison, and bringing them out, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go, and presenting yourselves in the temple, speak to the people all the words of this life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And hearing this, they went very early into the temple, and taught. But the high priest being come, and they that were with him, they called together the Sanhedrim, even the whole Senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the officers came, they found them not in the prison. Returning, therefore, they made their report,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>saying, We found, indeed, the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing before the doors; but, having opened them, we found no one within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, when the high priest, and the captain of the temple guard, and the chief priests heard these words, they doubted concerning them, what this could be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But one came, and told them, Behold, the men whom you put in prison, are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the captain went, with the officers, and brought them, (not by violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and when they had brought them, they set them before the Sanhedrim. And the high priest asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, Did we not strictly charge you, that you should not teach in this name? and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and would bring this man's blood upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter and the other Apostles answered, and said, It is necessary to obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom you slew, hanging him on a tree:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>HIM has God exalted at his right hand, a Prince and Saviour, to give reformation to Israel, and remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God has given to them who submit to his government.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they heard this, they were enraged, and consulted to put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But a certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrim, whose name was Gamaliel, a doctor of law, in great esteem among all the people, rose up, and commanded the Apostles to be taken out for a little while;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you are about to do to these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Some time ago Theudas arose, pretending himself to be a person of note: to whom a number of men, about four hundred, adhered, who was slain; and all who hearkened to him were scattered, and came to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After him, Judas, the Galilean, arose, in the days of the enrollment, and drew a multitude of people after him, and he was destroyed; and all who hearkened to him were dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now, in the present case, I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this design and work be of men, it will be defeated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but if it be of God, you can not defeat them: lest, perhaps, you be found fighters against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they yielded to him; and having called in the Apostles, and scourged them, they charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they departed from the presence of the Sanhedrim. rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be exposed to infamy for the sake of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And, daily, in the temple, and from house to house, they ceased not to teach and declare the good news, that Jesus is the Messiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
