And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but arise, and go into the city, and you shall be told what you must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men who traveled with him, stood astonished; hearing, indeed, the voice, but seeing no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Saul arose from the earth; and, though his eyes were open, he saw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, whose name was Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias! And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for a man of Tarsus, whose name is Saul; for, behold, he is praying to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he has seen in a vision, a man whose name is Ananias, coming in and laying his hand upon him, that he might recover his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many concerning this man, how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all that invoke thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord said to him, Go your way; for this man is to me a chosen vessel, to bear my name before nations, and kings, and the children of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Ananias went, and entered into the house; and laying his hands upon him, he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, who appeared to you on the way, as you came, has sent me; that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales; and he recovered his sight, and arose, and was immersed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and having received food, he was strengthened, and for several days remained with the disciples at Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all that heard him were astonished, and said, Is not this he who, in Jerusalem, spread desolation among them who called on his name; and came hither on purpose to carry such bound to the chief priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul became stronger, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, evincing that this is the Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, after many days, the Jews conspired to kill him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but their design was made known to Saul; and they watched the gates, day and night, to murder him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he was come to Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples; but they feared him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas, taking him, brought him to the Apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way; and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly, at Damascus, in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was with them, coming in, and going out, at Jerusalem; and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spoke, and disputed with the Hellenists; but they attempted to kill him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the brethren, being informed of it, conducted him to Caesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the congregations though all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, being edified, had rest; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the admonition of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now it came to pass, that Peter, making a tour through all the congregations, came also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he found there a certain man, whose name was Eneas, who has a palsy, and had kept his bed eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus, the Messiah, heals you; arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all the inhabitants of Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was at Joppa, a certain female disciple, named Tabitha, who, by interpretation, is called Dorcas; and she was full of good works, and alm-deeds, which she did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died. And when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, entreating him that he would not delay to come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Peter arose, and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber; and all the widows stood by him weeping; and showing the coats and mantles, which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Peter putting them all out, kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise! And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And giving her his hand, he raised her up; and having called the saints and widows, he presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And this was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he continued many days at Joppa, in the house of one Simon, a tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
