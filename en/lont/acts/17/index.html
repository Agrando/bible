And all these men act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they alarmed the multitude and the magistrates of the city, when they heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And having taken security of Jason, and the rest, they dismissed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas, by night, to Berea: and when they came thither, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now these were of a more noble disposition that those of Thessalonica: for they received the word with all readiness of mind, daily examining the scriptures, whether those things were so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Many of them, therefore, believed; both of the Grecian women of considerable rank, and of the men not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as soon as some of the Jews of Thessalonica understood that the word of God was announced by Paul at Berea, they came thither, also, exciting the populace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, as if he were to go by sea. But Silas and Timothy continued there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens: and having received an order for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him as soon as possible, they set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit within him was strongly moved when he beheld the city enslaved to idolatry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He therefore reasoned with the Jews and proselytes in the synagogue; and in the forum, daily, with those who met with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers opposed him. Others said, What would this babbler say? And others, he seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities; because he declared to them the good news concerning Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took him and conducted him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, which is spoken by you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for you bring some strange things to our ears; we would, therefore, know what these things mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For all the Athenians, and the strangers that sojourned among them spent their leisure in nothing else but in telling or hearing news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Paul, therefore, standing up in the middle of Areopagus, said, Athenians, I perceive that you are exceedingly addicted to the worship of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For, as I passed along, and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar with this inscription, To the Unknown God: Him, therefore, you ignorantly worship, I announce to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who made the world, and all things that are in it, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Neither is he served by human hands, as if he stood in need of anything; he himself giving to all, life, and breath, and all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he has made of one blood, the whole race of men, to inhabit all the face of the earth; having marked out the times previously arranged in order, and the boundaries of their habitations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they might seek after the Lord, if possibly they might feel after him, and find him; though he be not far from every one of us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>«for in him we live, and are moved, and do exist; as some of your own poets have said-For we his offspring are.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We, therefore, being the offspring of God, ought not to imagine the Deity to be like gold, or silver, or stone, wrought by the art and contrivance of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For though God overlooked the times of ignorance, he now makes proclamation to all men, everywhere, to reform;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world righteously, by that Man whom he has ordained: of which he has given assurance to all men, by raising him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some made a jest of it, and others said, We will hear you again upon this subject.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And this Paul went out of the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nevertheless, some men adhered to him, and believed: among whom was Dionysius, the Areopagite; also a woman, whose name was Damaris; and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
