I am pure. From henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And going out thence, he went into the house of one called Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now, Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed; and were immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the Lord said to Paul, in a vision by night, Fear not, but speak, and do not keep silence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for I am with you, and no man shall fall on you, to injure you; for I have much people in this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made an assault upon Paul, with one consent, and brought him before the tribunal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Paul would have opened his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were an act of injustice, or mischievous licentiousness, O Jews! it were reasonable I should bear with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if it be a question concerning words, and names, and the law which is among you, you see to it yourselves; for I will be no judge of these matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them away from the tribunal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the tribunal; but Gallio did not concern himself at all about the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Paul still continued there for a considerable time, and then taking leave of the brethren, sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shaved his head at Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he arrived at Ephesus, and there he left them; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And though they entreated him to have staid longer with them, he did not consent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but he took his leave of them, saying, It is necessary for me, all means, to celebrate the approaching feast at Jerusalem; but I will return to you again, God willing. And he set sail from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And landing at Caesarea, he went up; and having saluted the congregation, he went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and having saluted the congregation, he went down to Antioch. And having spent some time there, he departed, going through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in a regular manner confirming all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, a certain Jew, whose name was Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, and powerful in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This person was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught them things of the Lord with great accuracy, being only acquainted with the immersion of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla hearing him, took him aside, and explained to him the way of God in a more perfect manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he intended to go over to Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples, exhorting them to receive him. And being arrived there, by his gift he greatly helped those who had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he strenuously debated with the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures, that Jesus is the Messiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
