And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms are come up, as a memorial before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now send men to Joppa and bring hither Simon, whose surname is Peter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he lodges with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As soon as the messenger, who spoke to Cornelius, was gone, he called two of his domestics, and a pious soldier, of them that waited upon him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and having related to them all these things, he sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On the next day, while they were on their journey, and drew near the city, Peter went up to the top of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he was hungry, and would have taken a little refreshment; but while they were preparing, he fell into an ecstasy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and he saw heaven opened, and something descending like a great sheet, fastened at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>in which there were all sorts of things, even four-footed animals of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter, kill, and eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, By no means, Lord; for I have never eat anything which is common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the voice said to him again, the second time, Those things which God has cleansed, do not you call common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this was done three times, and the sheet was taken up again into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While Peter was pondering in himself, what the vision, which he had seen, might import; behold, the men, who were sent from Cornelius, having inquired out the house of Simon, stood at the door;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and calling, they asked, if Simon, whose surname was Peter, lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, as Peter was reflecting on this vision; the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are inquiring for you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>arise, therefore, go down, and go with them without hesitation; for I have sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter went down to the men, who were sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold, I am the man whom you seek; what is the cause of your coming?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said, Cornelius, the centurion, a righteous man, who fears God, and has a character attested by all the Jewish people, has been instructed, by a holy messenger, to send for you to his house, and to hear words from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Having, therefore, called them in, he entertained them, and the next day set out with them: and some of the brethren, who were of Joppa, went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the next day they entered into Caesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relations and intimate friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and prostrating himself at his feet, made obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter raised him up, saying, Arise; I also am a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And discoursing with him, he went in, and found many gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, You know that it is unlawful for a man that is a Jew to join with, or to come into the house of, one of another nation; nevertheless, God has shown me that I am to call no man common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Wherefore, when I was sent for, I came without debate: I ask, therefore, on what account you have sent for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Cornelius said, Four days ago, I was fasting till this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house; and, behold, a man stood before me in bright raiment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and said, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are remembered before God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>send, therefore, to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he lodges in the house of one Simon, a tanner, by the seaside; who, when he is come, shall speak to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Immediately, therefore, I sent to you, and you have done well in coming. Now, therefore, we are all here present before God, to hear all things which God has given to you in charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Peter, opening his mouth, said, Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but, in every nation, he that fears him, and works of righteousness, is acceptable to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>This is that message which he sent to the children of Israel; proclaiming the glad tidings of peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You know the report there was, through all Judea, which began from Galilee, after the immersion which John preached,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>concerning Jesus of Nazareth; how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the region of the Jews, and in Jerusalem: whom they slew, hanging him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>This very person God raised up, on the third day, and granted him to become manifest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people, but to witnesses before appointed by God, even to us, who have eat and drunk with him after he arose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he has given in charge to us to proclaim to the people, and to testify that it is he who is appointed by God, to be the judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>To him all the prophets bear witness, that every one who believes on him, shall receive forgiveness of sins by his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were hearing the word:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and they of the circumcision, who believed, as many as came with Peter, were astonished that the gift of the Spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles also:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>for they heard them speaking in diverse languages, and glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then Peter answered, Can any one forbid water, that these persons should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he ordered them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. And they entreated him to continue with them several days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
