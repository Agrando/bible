I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you know perfectly well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, if, indeed, I have done wrong, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if there is no fact of which they accuse me, no man can give me up to gratify them! I appeal to Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus, having spoken with the council, answered, Have you appealed to Cesar? To Cesar you shall go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when some days were passed, King Agrippa, and Bernice, came to Caesarea, to pay their respects to Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as they continued there many days, Festus laid before the king the case of Paul, saying, There is a certain man, left in bonds by Felix;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews, informed me, desiring judgment against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and be allowed an opportunity of making his defense, as to the crime laid to his charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When, therefore, they were come hither, I, without any delay, sat down on the tribunal next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but had certain questions against him, relating to their own religion, and about one Jesus, that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But as I was dubious of the question relating to him, I said, that if he were willing, he should go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Paul, appealing to be kept to the hearing of his majesty, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Agrippa said to Festus, I also would willingly hear the man myself. And he said, To-morrow you shall hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The next day, therefore, Agrippa and Bernice, coming with great pomp, and entering into the place of audience, with the commanders and principal men of the city; at the command of Festus, Paul was brought forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you who are present with us! you see this man, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem, and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I could not apprehend him to have done anything worthy of death; yet, as he himself has appealed to his majesty, I have determined to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to my master: wherefore, I have brought him out before you all; and especially before you, King Agrippa! that, after examination taken, I may have something to write:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for it seems to me absurd, to send a prisoner, and not to signify the crimes alleged against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
