And he leaped up, and walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the multitude, seeing what Paul had done, lifted up their voices, saying, in the Lycaonian language, The gods are descended to us in the likeness of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Barnabas they called Jupiter, and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest of Jupiter, whose image was before the city, brought oxen, with garlands, to the gates; and would, with the multitude, have offered sacrifice to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, hearing of it, rent their mantles, and ran in among the multitude, crying out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, Men, why do you these things? We are your fellow-mortals, and are declaring the glad tidings to you, that you may turn from these vanities to the living God; who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all living things which are in them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who, in former generations, permitted all the nations to walk in their own ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>though he did not leave himself without witness, doing good, and giving us showers of rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, saying these things, they, with difficulty, restrained the people from sacrificing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jews came thither from Antioch and Iconium, and persuaded the multitude; and having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, as the disciples were gathered about him, he rose up, and entered into the city; and the next day he departed, with Barnabas, to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having declared the gospel to that city, and made a considerable number of disciples; they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>confirming the souls of the disciples; exhorting them to continue in the faith, and testifying that it is necessary we should enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had constituted elders for them, in every congregation, having prayed to God, with fasting; they committed them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they sailed thence to Antioch, whence they had been recommended to the grace of God, for that work which they had accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they were come thither, and had gathered the congregation together, they related what God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they spent a considerable time there with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
