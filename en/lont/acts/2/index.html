and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And there appeared to them tongues resembling fire, distinctly separated, and it rested upon each of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now there were sojourning in Jerusalem pious men; Jews from every nation under heaven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and when this report came abroad, the multitude assembled, and were confounded; for every one heard them speaking in his own dialect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another, Behold! are not all these that speak, Galileans?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And how do we every one hear in his own native language:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those that inhabit Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Phrygia, and Pamphilia, Egypt, and the parts of Africa which are about Cyrene: Roman strangers, also, both Jews and proselytes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Cretes, and Arabians; we hear them speaking in our own tongues the wonderful works of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they were all in amazement and perplexity, and said one to another, What can this mean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But others, mocking, said, Surely these men are filled with sweet wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice, and said to them-Jews, and all you that sojourn in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and attend to my words;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is but the third hour of the day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>«And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, I will pour out a portion of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters shall prophesy; and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes, in those days I will pour out of my Spirit upon my servants, and upon my handmaids; and they shall prophesy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and I will give prodigies in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood and fire, and a cloud of smoke:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and illustrious day of the Lord come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>«And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall invoke the name of the Lord shall be saved.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Israelites, hear these words: Jesus, the Nazarene, a man recommended to you by God, by powerful operations, and wonders, and signs, which God wrought by him in the midst of you, (as you yourselves also know,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>him you have apprehended, being given up by the declared counsel and foreknowledge of God, and by the hands of sinners have crucified and slain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death, as it was impossible that he should be held under it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>«For David says, concerning him,» 'I have regarded the Lord as always before me; because he is at my right hand, that I might not be moved:'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for this reason my heart is glad, and my tongue exults; moreover, too, my flesh shall rest in hope</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that thou wilt not leave my soul in the unseen world, neither wilt thou permit thy Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>«Thou hast made me to know the ways of life; thou wilt make me full of joy with thy countenance.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Brethren, permit me to speak freely to you concerning the patriarch David; the he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is among us to this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins he would raise up the Messiah to sit on his throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he, foreseeing this, spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, that his soul should not be left in the unseen world, nor his flesh see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus, God has raised up, of which all we are witnesses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>being exalted, therefore, to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has shed forth this, which you see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>«For David is not ascended into heaven, but he says,» 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>till I make thy foes thy footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Let, therefore, all the house of Israel assuredly know, that God has made this Jesus, whom you have crucified, Lord and Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now, when they heard these things, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter, and the rest of the Apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter said to them, Reform, and be each of you immersed in the name of Jesus Christ, in order to the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off; as many as the Lord our God shall call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words he testified, and exhorted, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They, therefore, who received his word with readiness, were immersed: and there were added to the disciples that very day, about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they continued steadfast in the teaching, in the fellowship, in the breaking of the load, and in the prayers of the Apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Fear also fell upon every soul, and many miracles and signs were wrought by the Apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all that believed were together, and had all things in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They also sold their possessions and effects, and distributed them to every one according to his necessity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Moreover, they continued unanimously in the temple every day; and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with joy and simplicity of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God, having favor with all the people: and the Lord daily added the saved to the congregation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
