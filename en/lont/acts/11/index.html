And all the things were drawn up again into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, at that instant, three men were come to the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Spirit commanded me to go with them, without any scruple: and these six brethren also went along with me. And we entered into the man's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he told us how he had seen a messenger standing in his house, and saying to him, Send to Joppa, and bring hither Simon, whose surname is Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who shall speak words to you, by which you and all your family shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as on us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John immersed in water; but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Since, therefore, God gave to them the same gift as he did to us, who had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I, that I should be able to obstruct God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they heard these things, they acquiesced, and glorified God; saying, God has, then, given to the Gentile also reformation to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, indeed, those who had been dispersed, on account of the distress which arose about Stephen, had traveled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none but Jews only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet some of the, being men of Cyprus, and Cyrene; when they came to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks, announcing the glad tidings concerning the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the report concerning them came to the ears of the congregation that was at Jerusalem; and they sent Barnabas, to go as far as Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, when he was come, and beheld the favor of God, rejoiced, and exhorted them all to adhere to the Lord, with full determination of heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith: and a considerable number were added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus, to seek Saul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and finding him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that they assembled with the congregation, for a whole year, and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first named Christians at Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of them, whose name was Agabus, stood up, and signified by the Spirit, that there should be a great famine over all the land: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the disciples determined, that, according to the respective abilities of each, they should send to the assistance of the brethren who dwelt in Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And this they did, sending it to the elders, by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
