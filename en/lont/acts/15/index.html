they resolved that Paul and Barnabas, and some others of their number, should go up to the Apostles and elders at Jerusalem, about this question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They, therefore, being brought forward on their journey, by the congregation, went through Phenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they occasioned great joy to all the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And being arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the congregation, and by the Apostles and elders: and they related what things God had done with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But some of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, rose up and said, that it was necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Apostles and elders were gathered together to consult upon this affair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after much debate, Peter rose up and said to them, Brethren, you know that, some considerable time since, God among us, chose, that the Gentiles, by my mouth, should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did to us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and made no distinction between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now, therefore, why do you tempt God by imposing on the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But we believe that we are saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the whole multitude kept silence, and attended to Barnabas and Paul; relating what signs and wonders God had done among the heathen, by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then after they had done speaking, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simeon has been relating how God first looked down on the Gentiles, to take from among them a people for his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the words of the prophets harmonize with this; as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>«After this, I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; yes, I will rebuild its ruins, and set it upright again:»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that the remainder of men may seek the Lord, even all the heathen upon whom my name is called,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>«says the Lord,» 'who does all these things, known to him from the beginning.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore, my judgment is not to disquiet those who, from among the Gentiles, are converted to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but to write to them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from that which is strangled, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Moses has, from ancient generations, those who preach him, in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it seemed good to the Apostles and elders, and all the congregation, to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, chosen men from among themselves, namely, Judas, surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, men of principal account among the brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>writing by their hands these things: The Apostles, and elders, and brethren, to the brethren from among the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, greeting:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Forasmuch as we have been informed that, some going out from among us, to whom we gave no commission, have troubled you with discourses, unsettling your minds, saying, that you must be circumcised, and keep the law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>we, being unanimously assembled, have thought proper to send you chosen men, with out beloved Barnabas and Paul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men that have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have, therefore, sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you by word of mouth, the same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to impose no further burden upon you besides these necessary things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that you abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from anything strangled, and from fornication: from which you will do well to keep yourselves. Farewell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They, therefore, being dismissed, came to Antioch; and assembling the multitude, delivered the epistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation it brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Judas and Silas, being also prophets themselves; in a copious discourse, exhorted and strengthened the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And, having made some stay, they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to the Apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Silas thought proper to continue there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Paul also, and Barnabas, with many others, continued at Antioch; teaching and declaring the good word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return and visit the brethren in all the cities in which we have published the word of the Lord; and see how they do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Barnabas determined to take along with them John, surnamed Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Peter did not think proper to take with them that person who had withdrawn himself from them from Pamphylia; and went not with them to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>There was, therefore, a sharp fit of anger, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking Mark along with him, sailed to Cyprus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Paul made choice of Silas, and departed; being commended to the grace of God, by the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the congregations;</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
