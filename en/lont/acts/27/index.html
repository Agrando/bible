Aristarchus, a Macedonian, of Thessalonica, being with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the next day we reached Sidon: and Julius, treating Paul with great humanity, permitted him to go to his friends, and to enjoy the benefit of their care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And weighing anchor thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And sailing through the sea over against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there, the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria, bound for Italy, put us on board of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had sailed slowly for several days, and were hardly got over against Cnidus, the wind now permitting us; we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and passing it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called the Fair Havens, in the neighborhood of which, was the city of Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, as much time was spent, and sailing was now hazardous, because the fast was already over, Paul exhorted them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>saying to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be attended with injury and great damage, not only to the lading and to the ship, but also to our lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the centurion paid greater regard to the pilot, and the master of the vessel, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as the haven was not commodious to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from thence, if they might possibly reach Phenice, to winter there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>which is a haven of Crete, looking to the southwest and northwest: and as the south win blew gently, supposing they were secure of their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed on close to Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But not long after, there arose against her a tempestuous wind, which is called Euroclydon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as the ship was violently hurried away, and was not able to bear up against the wind, we gave her up, and were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>An running under a certain island, called Clauda, we were hardly able to get masters of the boat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>which, when they had hoisted up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing, lest they should fall upon the quicksands, they struck sail, and so were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we were exceedingly tossed by the storm, the next day they lightened the ship:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the third day we cast out, with our own hands, the tackling of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, as neither sun nor stars appeared for several days, and no small tempest pressed upon us, all remainder of hope that we might be delivered, was taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when there was great want of food, then Paul, standing in the midst of them, said, Sirs, you ought to have hearkened to me, and not to have loosed from Crete, and incurred this injury and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless, even now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of any life among you; but only of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For there appeared to me this night, an angel of the God whose I am, and whom I worship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be presented before Cesar; and, behold, God has given you all them that sail with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore, take courage, men; for I trust in God that it shall be so, even as it was told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But we must be cast upon a certain island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were tossed up and down in the Adriatic sea, the mariners suspected, about midnight that they drew near to some land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and sounding, they found it twenty fathoms: and having gone a little way from thence, and sounding again, they found it fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And fearing lest they should fall upon some rocky shore, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished that the day would break.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when the mariners endeavored to flee out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea, under pretense that they were about to carry out anchors from the ship-head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these continue in the ship, you can not be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut off the cords of the boat, and let it fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take some food, saying, Today, whilst waiting for this fourteenth day, you continue fasting, having taken nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I exhort you, therefore, to take a refreshment; for this is conducive to your safety: for not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he had spoke thus, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God, before them all; and having broken it, he began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And being all encouraged, they also took some food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And we were in the ship, in all two hundred and seventy-six souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And being satisfied with food, they lightened the ship; and cast the corn into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when it was day, they did not know the land: but they perceived a certain creek, with a shore, into which they determined, if they were able, to force the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having cut off the anchors, leaving them in the sea, they, at the same time, loosing the rudder bands, and hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, pressed toward the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But falling on a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground, and the fore part stuck fast, and remained immovable, while the hinder part was broken by the force of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the counsel of the soldiers was, that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim away, and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the centurion, being desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and commanded those that could swim, to throw themselves out first, into the sea, and get away to land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the remainder, some upon planks, and others upon some of the things of the ship. And so it happened that they all got safe to land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
