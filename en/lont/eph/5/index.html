(as it becomes saints;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>nor obscenity, nor foolish talking, nor double meanings, nor things uncomely; but rather thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor lascivious man, who is an idolater, has inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let no one deceive you with vain speeches; for on account of these things, the wrath of God comes upon the children of disobedience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not, therefore, participants with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For you were formerly darkness; but now you are light in the Lord; walk as children of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(Now, the fruit of life consists in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Approve what is well pleasing to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the things which are secretly done by them, it is base even to mention.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But all these reprehensible things are made manifest by the light; for whatever makes manifest is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore, it says, Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See, then, that you walk accurately: not as fools, but as wise men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>redeeming time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore be not simpletons, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we not drunk with wine, by which comes dissoluteness; but be filled with the Spirit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>speaking to one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs; singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>giving thanks at all times for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Be subject to one another, in the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the husband is head of the wife, even as Christ is head of the congregation; he is the saviour of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, as the congregation is subject to Christ; so, also, let the wives be to their own husbands, in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ, also, loved the congregation, and gave himself for it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it with a bath of water, with the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That he might present it to himself glorious, a congregation not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it might be holy, and without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So ought husbands to love their own wives, as their own bodies: he who loves his own wife, loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the congregation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this reason shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall adhere to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is a great mystery; but I speak concerning Christ and the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, also, let every one of you in particular, so love his own wife as himself; and let the wife reverence her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
