with long-suffering, bearing with one another in love;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>earnestly endeavoring to preserve the unity of the Spirit by the bond of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There is one body, and one Spirit; as also you have been called with one hope of your calling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>one Lord, one faith, one immersion;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>one God and Father of all, who is over all, and with all, and in you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But to every one of us is given favor, according to the measure of the gift of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(Wherefore he says, Having ascended on high, he captivated captivity, and gave gifts to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, this-Having ascended, what is it, unless, indeed, he had also descended into the lower parts of the earth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who descended, is the same who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he gave some, indeed, Apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the adapting of these saints to the work of the ministry, for the edification of the body of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>till we all come to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God; to a perfect man; to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that we may be no longer children, tossed and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sight of men, and by cunning craftiness for an artifice of seduction:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but speaking the truth in love, we may all grow into him, who is the Head, even Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>from whom, the whole body, fitly joined together, and compacted by the service of every joint, according to the energy, in the proportion of each particular part, effects the increase of the body, for the edification of itself in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This, therefore, I say, and testify in the Lord, that you walk no longer as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>having their understandings darkened; being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who, being past feeling, have abandoned themselves to lasciviousness, to commit all uncleanness with greediness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But you have not so learned Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>if, indeed, you have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>that, with respect to your former conduct, you put away the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that you be renewed in the spirit of your minds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and that you put on the new man; which, after God, is created in righteousness and true holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore, putting away lying, speak the truth every one to his neighbor: for we are members one of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Do not sin, through anger; let not the sun go down upon your wrath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>neither give an opportunity to the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let him that stole, steal no more; but rather let him labor, working with his hands that which is good, that he may have to impart to him who has need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let no corrupt discourse come out of your mouth; but if any speech be good for the use of edification, speak it, that it may impart a benefit to the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you are sealed till the day of redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let all bitterness, and anger, and wrath, and clamor, and detraction, be taken away from among you, with all malice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, even as God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
