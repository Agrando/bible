These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, as the first fruits to God, and to the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And no deceit was found in their mouth; for they are blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having everlasting good news to proclaim to the inhabitants of the earth, even to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgments is come: and worship him who made heaven, and earth, and sea, and the fountains of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another angel followed, saying, It is fallen! it is fallen! even Babylon the Great; because it made all the nations drink of the wine of its raging fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any one worship the beast, and his image, and receive the mark on his forehead, or on his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he also shall drink of the wine of the indignation of God, which is tempered, without mixture, in the cup of his wrath; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment ascends for ever and ever: and they have no rest, day nor night, who worship the beast, and his image; and whoever receives the mark of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is the patience of the saints: here are those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write: Henceforth blessed are the dead that die in the Lord; yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works follow them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud, one sitting like a Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another angel came out of the temple of God, crying with a loud voice, to him that sat upon the cloud.
