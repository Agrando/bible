I will tell you the secret of the woman, and of the beast which carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The beast which you saw, was, and is not; and he will ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go to destruction; and the inhabitants of the earth (whose names are not written in the book of life, from the foundation of the world) shall wonder, seeing the beast who was, and is not, yet shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must endure for a little time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the beast that was, and is not, he is the eighth, and is of the seven, but goes to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the ten horns which you saw, are ten kings, which have not yet received their kingdom, but they shall receive authority with the beast, as kings at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These have one mind, and shall deliver their own power and authority to the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These shall make war with the Lamb; and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is the Lord of lords, and King of kings; and those that are with him, are called, and chosen, and faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to me, The waters which you saw, on which the harlot sat, are people, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and make her desolate and naked; and they shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God has given it into the hearts to execute his sentence, even to perform one purpose; and to give their kingdoms to the beast, till the words of God be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the woman which you saw, is the great city, that rules over the kings of the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
