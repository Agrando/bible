Because she has said in her heart, I sit as a queen, and am not a widow, and shall not see sorrow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>therefore, in one day shall her plagues come-death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be burnt with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judges her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication, and lived in luxury with her, shall mourn and lament, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>standing afar off, for fear of her torment, saying, Alas! alas! the great city, Babylon; the strong city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the merchants of the earth shall wail and lament over her, because no one buys their wares any longer-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the merchandise of gold, and silver, and jewels, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and every odiferous wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood, and of brass, and of iron, and of marble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cinnamon, and perfume, and myrrh, and incense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and oxen, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the fruits which thy soul desired, are gone from thee; and all delicious and splendid things are departed from thee, and thou shalt never find them any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The merchants of these commodities, who were enriched by her, shall stand afar off, for fear of her torment, weeping, and mourning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and saying, Alas! alas! the great city, that was clothed with fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, and precious stones, and pearls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for in one hour all these riches are laid waste. And every pilot, and every passenger, and the mariners, and all that bestow their labor upon the sea, stood afar off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and cried, when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like to the great city!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping, and mourning, saying, Alas! alas! the great city, by whose magnificent expenses, all that had ships in the sea were enriched; for she is made desolate in one hour!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and you saints, and apostles, and prophets; for on your account God has pronounced sentence upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a strong angel took a stone, like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea; saying, Thus shall Babylon, the great city, he dashed down with violence, and never be found again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the voice of harpers, and musicians, of them that play the flute, and sound the trumpet, shall be heard no more in thee; nor shall the noise of the millstone be heard any more in thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the light of a lamp shall be seen no more in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom, and of the bride, shall be heard no more in thee: because they merchants were the grandees of the earth-because by thy sorceries were all the nations deceived:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, even of all those who were slain upon the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
