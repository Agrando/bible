And the smoke of her torment ascended for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the twenty-four elders, and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, sitting upon the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a voice came out from the throne, which said, Praise our God, all you his servants, you that fear him, both small and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard a sound, which was as the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and like the peal of mighty thunderings, saying, Hallelujah! for the Lord God, the Omnipotent, reigns!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We rejoice, and exult, and give glory to him, because the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has prepared herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, pure and resplendent; and the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, Write-Happy are they who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb! And he said to me, These are the true words of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I fell before his feet to worship him; and he said to me, See you do it not: I am a fellow-servant with you, and with your brethren who keep the testimony of Jesus. Worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and he that sat upon it was called Faithful and True; and he judges and makes war in righteousness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>whose eyes are as a flame of fire; and many diadems were upon his head, having a name written which no man knows but himself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he was clothed in a garment dipped in blood, and his name is called THE WORD OF GOD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the armies which are in heaven followed him, riding on white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there went out of his mouth a sharp sword, that with it he might smite the nations: and he shall govern them with a rod of iron; and he treads the wine press of the indignation and wrath of almighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he has upon his garment and his thigh a name written- KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I saw a single angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds of prey, which were flying in the midst of heaven, Come, and assemble yourselves to the great supper of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of commanders, and the flesh of the mighty, and the flesh of horses, and of those that sat on them; and the flesh of all, both freemen and slaves, both small and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war with him who sits upon the white horse, and with his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the beast was taken captive, and with him the false prophet, who had wrought signs before him, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast, and those who worshiped his image; both of whom were cast alive into the lake of fire which burned with brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rest were slain with the sword that came out of the mouth of him who sat on the horse: and all the birds were satiated with their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
