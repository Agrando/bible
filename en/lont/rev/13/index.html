And the whole earth wondered, and followed after the wild beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and they worshiped the dragon who gave authority to the wild beast, saying, Who is like to the beast? who can war against it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there was given to it a mouth speaking great things, and defamation: and there was given to it power to practice forty-two months-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and it opened its mouth to utter defamation against God; to defame his name and his tabernacle, and those that dwell in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was given to it to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to it power over every tribe, and tongue, and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the inhabitants of the earth shall worship it, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb, that was slain from the beginning of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If any one has an ear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If any one lead them into captivity, he shall be led into captivity: if any one slay with the sword, he shall himself be slain with the sword.
