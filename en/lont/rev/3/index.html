and I will not blot out his name from the book of life; but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And by the messenger of the congregation in Philadelphia, write: These things says the Holy One, the True One; who has the key, the Son of David; he who opens and no man shuts; and shuts, and no man opens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I know your works: behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it; because you have little strength, and have kept my word, and have not denied my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, I will give of those-who are of the assembly of Satan; who say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold-I will make them to come and worship before your feet; and they shall know that I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because you have kept the word of my patience, I will also keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try the inhabitants of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I come quickly: keep that which you have, that no man take your crown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As for the conqueror, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more: and I will inscribe upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem, which is to come down from heaven, from my God; and my new name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And by the messenger of the congregation in Laodicea, write: These things says the AMEN, the Faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot: I wish you were either cold or hot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because you say, I am wealthy, and have enriched myself, and have need of nothing; and do not know that you are wretched and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white apparel, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness may not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye-salve, that you may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As many as I love, I reprove and correct; therefore, be zealous, and reform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any one hear my voice, and open the door, I will enter into his house, and will sup with him, and he with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As for the conqueror, I will give him to sit down with me upon my throne; as I also have conquered, and sat down with my Father upon his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whoever has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
