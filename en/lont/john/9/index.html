It was only that the works of God might be displayed upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; the night comes, when no man can work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Having said this, he spit upon the ground, and with the clay, which he made with the spittle, anointed the blind man's eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and said to him, Go wash in the pool of Siloam, (which signifies Sent.) He went, therefore, and washed them, and returned seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the neighbors, and they who had before seen him blind, said, Is not this he who sat and begged?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, It is he; others, He is like him. He said, I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They asked him, then, How did you receive your sight?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, A man called Jesus, made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash your eyes. I went accordingly, and washed them, and saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they asked him, Where is he? He answered, I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they brought him, who had been blind, to the Pharisees;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(now it was on a Sabbath, that Jesus made the clay, and gave him his sight.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Pharisees likewise, therefore, asked him how he had received his sight. He answered, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and now see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Upon this some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, for he observes not the Sabbath. Others said, How can one that is a sinner perform such miracles? And they were divided among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Again they asked the man, who had been blind, What do you say of him, for giving you sight? He answered, He is a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the Jews believed not that the man had been blind, and had received his sight; till they called his parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and asked them, Do you say, that this is your son, who was born blind? How, then, does he now see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but how he now sees, or who opened his eyes, we know not. He is of age, ask him; he will answer for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>His parents spoke thus, because they fear the Jews: for the Jews had already determined, that whosoever acknowledged Jesus to be the Messiah, should be expelled from the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For this reason his parents said, He is of age, ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A second time, therefore, they called the man, who had been born blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He replied, Whether he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, I now see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he make you see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered, I told you before; did you not hear? Why would you hear it repeated? Will you, also, be his disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They reviled him and said, You are his disciple. As for us, we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this man, we know not whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man replied, This is surprising, that you know not whence he is, although he has given me sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God hears not sinners; but if any man worship God, and obey him, that man he hears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Never was it heard before, that any man gave sight to one born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They replied, You were altogether born in sin, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having met him, said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered, Who is he, Sir, that I may believe on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, Not only have you seen him; but it is he, who talks with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried, Master, I believe; and threw himself prostrate before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they who see not, may see; and that they who see, may become blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Some Pharisees, who were present, hearing this, said to him, Are we also blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus answered, If you were blind, you would not have sin: but you say, We see: therefore your sin remains.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
