But Jesus, having stooped down, was writing with his finger, upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, Let him who is sinless, amongst you, throw the first stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, having stooped down, he wrote upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They, hearing that, withdrew, one after another, the eldest first, till Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus, raising himself, and seeing none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those, your accusers? Has no person passed sentence on you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She answered, No person, Sir. Jesus said to her, Neither do I pass sentence on you. Go, and sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Again Jesus addressed the people, saying, I am the light of the world. He who follows me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore retorted, You testify concerning yourself; your testimony is not to be regarded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered, Though I testify concerning myself, my testimony ought to be regarded; because I know whence I came, and whither I go. As for you, you know not whence I came, and whither I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You judge from passion; I judge no person:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and if I do, my judgment ought to be regarded, for I am not alone, but concur with the Father, who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is a maxim in your law, that the concurrent testimony of two is credible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now I am one who testify concerning myself; the Father that sent me is another that testifies of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they asked him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither me nor my Father: if you knew me, you would know my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These things he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple, and no person seized him, his hour not being yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Again, Jesus said to them, I am going away; you will seek me, and shall die in your sins; whither I go, you can not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself, that he says, Whither I go, you can not come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>therefore I said, You shall die in your sins; for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They, therefore, asked him, Who are you? Jesus answered, The same that I told you formerly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say of you, and to reprove in you: but he who sent me is worthy of belief; and I do but publish to the world what I have learned from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They did not perceive, that he meant the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus, therefore, said to them, When you shall have raised the Son of Man on high, then you shall know what I am; and that I do nothing of myself, and say nothing which the Father has not taught me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do what pleases him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>While he spoke thus, many believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus, therefore, said to those Jews who believed on him, If you persevere in my doctrine, you are my disciples indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you shall know the truth: and the truth shall make you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Some made answer, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never enslaved to any man. How do you say, You shall be made free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus replied, Most assuredly, I say to you, whosoever commits sin is a slave of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now the slave abides not in the family perpetually, the Son abides perpetually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If, therefore, the Son make you free, you will be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that you are Abraham's offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my doctrine has no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak what I have seen with my Father: and you do what you have learned from your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered, Abraham is our Father. Jesus replied, If you were Abraham's children, you would act as Abraham acted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I received from God. Abraham acted not thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You do the deeds of your father. They answered, We were not born of fornication, We have one Father, even God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus replied, If God were your Father, you would love me; for I proceeded, and am come from God. I came not of myself. He sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do you not understand my language? It is because you can not bear my doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The devil is your father, and the desires of your father you will gratify: he was a manslayer from the beginning; he swerved from the truth, because there was no veracity in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks suitably to his character; for he is a liar, and the father of lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>As for me, because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who of you convicts me of falsehood? And if I speak truth, why do you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He who is of God, regards God's words. You regard them not, because you are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Jews then answered, Have we not reason to say, You are a Samaritan, and have a demon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus replied, I have not a demon: but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>As for me, I seek not to promote my own glory; another seeks it, who judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever keeps my word, shall never see death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews then said to him, Now we are certain that you have a demon: Abraham is dead, and the prophets; yet you say, Whoever keeps my word, shall never taste death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Are you greater than our Father Abraham, who is dead. The prophets also are dead: whom do you make yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, If I commend myself, my commendation is nothing: it is my Father, whom you call your God, who commends me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Nevertheless, you know him not; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I should speak falsely like you: but I know him, and keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he should see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Jews replied, You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then they took up stones to cast at him; but Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
