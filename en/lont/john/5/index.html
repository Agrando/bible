The Jews, therefore, said to him that was cured, This is the Sabbath. It is now lawful for you to carry the couch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, He who healed me, said to me, Take up your couch and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They asked him then, Who is the man that said to you, Take up your couch and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he that had been healed, knew who it was; for Jesus had slipped away, there being a crowd in the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus, afterward, finding him in the temple, said to him, Behold, you are cured; sin no more, lest something worse befall you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man went, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he had done this on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now; I also work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For this reason the Jews were the more intent to kill him; because he had not only broken the Sabbath, but, by calling God his real Father, had equaled himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Jesus addressed them, saying, Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but as he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, such does the Son, likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself does: nay, and will show him greater works than these, which will astonish you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raises and quickens the dead, the Son also quickens whom he will:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for the Father judges no person, having committed the power of judging entirely to the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that all might honor the Son; as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father, who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears my doctrine, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not suffer condemnation, having passed from death to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, the time comes; or, rather, is come, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and hearing, they shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For, as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son, to have life in himself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and has given him even the judicial authority, because he is a Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wonder not at this: for the time comes when all that are in their graves shall hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and shall come forth. They who have done good, shall arise to enjoy life; they who have done evil, shall arise to suffer punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not to please myself, but to please him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I alone testify concerning myself, my testimony is not to be regarded:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>there is another who testifies concerning me; and I know that his testimony of me ought to be regarded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You, yourselves, sent to John, and he bore testimony of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As for me, I need no human testimony; I can only urge this for your salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was the blazing and shining lamp; and for awhile, you were glad to enjoy his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have greater testimony than John's: for the works which the Father has empowered me to perform, the works themselves, which I do, testify for me, that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nay, the Father, who sent me, has himself attested me. Did you never hear his voice, or see his form?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Or, have you forgotten his declaration, that you believe not him whom he has sent forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You search the scriptures because you think to obtain by them eternal life. Now these, also, are witnesses for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>yet you will not come to me, that you may obtain life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I desire not honor from men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but I know you, that you are strangers to the love of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I am come in my Father's name, and you did not receive me; if another come, in his own name, you will receive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you believe, while you court honor one from another, regardless of the honor which comes from God alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I am he who will accuse you to the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you confide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you believed Moses, you would believe me: for he wrote concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
