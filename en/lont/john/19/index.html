King of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate went out again, and said to them, Lo, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find in him nothing culpable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus then went forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple mantle, and Pilate said to them, Behold the man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried, saying, Crucify, crucify him! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him; for my part, I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he assumed the title of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Pilate heard this, he was the more afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and having returned to the praetorium, said to Jesus, Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Pilate said to him, Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to crucify you, and power to release you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus replied, You could have no power over me, unless it were given you from above; wherefore, he who delivered me to you, has greater sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From that time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews exclaimed, If you release this man, you are not Cesar's friend. Whoever calls himself king, opposes Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate, on hearing these words, ordered Jesus to be brought forth, and sat down on the tribunal, in a place named The Pavement; in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(Now it was the preparation of the Paschal Sabbath, about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, Behold your King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they cried out, Away, away with him; crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no King but Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He delivered him, therefore, to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they took Jesus, and led him away. And he, carrying his cross, went out to a place called The Place of Skulls, which is, in Hebrew, Golgotha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they crucified him, and two others with him; one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. The words were, JESUS, THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of the Jews read this title, (for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh the city,) and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then the chief priests said to Pilate, Write not the King of the Jews; but, Who calls himself King of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his mantle and divided it into four parts, one to every soldier: they also took the coat, which was seamless, woven from the top throughout;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>«and said, among themselves, Let us not tear it, but determine by lot whose it shall be; by this verifying the scripture, which says,» 'They shared my mantle among them, and cast lots for my vesture.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus, therefore, acted the soldiers. Now, there stood near the cross of Jesus, his mother, and her sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Jesus, observing his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing by, said to his mother, Woman, behold your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to the disciple, Behold your mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus, (knowing that all was now accomplished,) that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And there was a vessel there full of vinegar, they filled a sponge with vinegar, and, having fastened it to a twig of hyssop, held it to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and bowing his head, yielded up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews, therefore, lest the bodies should remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for it was the preparation, (and that Sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and the bodies might be removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Accordingly, the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first and of the other, who were crucified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when they came to Jesus, and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But one of the soldiers with a spear, pierced his side, whence blood and water immediately issued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was an eye-witness, who attests this, and his testimony deserves credit: nay, he is conscious that he speaks truth, that you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>«For these things happened that the scripture might be verified,» 'None of his bones shall be broken.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>«Again, the scripture elsewhere says,» 'They shall look on him whom they have pierced.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After this, Joseph, the Arimathean, who was a disciple of Jesus, but a concealed disciple for fear of the Jews, asked permission of Pilate to take away the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nicodemus also, who had formerly repaired to Jesus by night, came, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>These men took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen rollers, with the spices, which is the Jewish manner of embalming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, wherein no one had ever yet been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There they deposited Jesus, on account of the Jewish preparation, the tomb being near.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
