Now, there was much grass in the place. So they reclined; in number about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed them to those who had reclined. He gave them also of the fishes, as much as they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they had eat sufficiently, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They, therefore, gathered, and with the fragments which the people had left of the five barley loaves, they filled twelve baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When those men had seen the miracle which Jesus had wrought they said, This is certainly the prophet who comes into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and carry him off, to make him king, withdrew again, alone, to the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the evening, his disciples went to the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and having embarked, were passing by sea to Capernaum. It was now dark; and Jesus had not come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the water was raised by a tempestuous wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they observed Jesus walking on the sea, very near the bark, and were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said to them, It is I, be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they gladly received him into the bark; and the bark was immediately at the place whither they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the next day, the people who were on the seaside, knowing that there had been but one boat there, and that Jesus went not into the boat with his disciples, who went alone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(other boats, however, arrived from Tiberias, nigh the place where they had eat, after the Lord had given thanks;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>knowing, besides, that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, embarked, and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Having found him on the opposite shore, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come hither?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw miracles, but because you eat of the loaves, and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures through eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for to him the Father, that is, God, has given his attestation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They asked him, therefore, What are the works which God requires us to do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered, This is the work which God requires-- that you believe on him whom he has sent forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They replied, What miracles, then, do you, that seeing it, we may believe you? What do you perform?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>«Our fathers eat the manna in the desert; as it is written,» 'He gave them bread of heaven to eat.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus then said to them, Most assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread of heaven: but my Father gives you the true bread of heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for the bread of God is that which descends from heaven, and gives life to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They said, therefore, to him, Master, give us always this bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus answered, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me, shall never hunger; and he who believes on me, shall never thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But, as I told you, though you have seen me, you do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All the Father gives me, will come to me; and him who comes to me, I will not reject.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I descended from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now, this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose none of all he has given me, but raise the whole again at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>This is the will of him who sent me, that whoever recognizes the Son, and believes on him, should obtain eternal life, and that I should raise him again at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews then murmured against him, because he said, I am the bread which descended from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How, then, does he say, I descended from heaven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered, Murmur not amongst yourselves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>no man can come to me, unless the Father, who has sent me, draw him; and him I will raise again at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>«It is written in the prophets,» 'They shall be taught of God.' 'Every one who has heard, and learned from the Father, comes to me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that any man, except him who is from God, has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes on me has eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers eat the manna in the desert, and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Behold the bread which descended from heaven, that whosoever eats of it may not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the living bread, which descended from heaven. Whosoever eats of this bread, shall live forever; and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I give for the life of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews then debated among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Jesus, therefore, said to them, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him again at the last day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>for my flesh is truly meat, and my blood is truly drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He who eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, abides in me, and I abide in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As the Father lives, who sent me; and I live by the Father; even so he, who feeds on me, shall live by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread which descended from heaven. It is not like what your fathers eat, for they died: he that eats this bread, shall live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This discourse he spoke in the synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Many of his disciples having heard it, said, This is hard doctrine; who can understand it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, Does this offend you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>What if you should see the Son of Man reascending thither, where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the Spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing. The words which I speak to you, are spirit and life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that did not believe, and who he was that would betray him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>He added, Therefore, I said to you, that no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>From this time, many of his disciples withdrew, and accompanied him no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Simon Peter answered, Master, to whom should we go? You have the words of eternal life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and we believe, and know that you are the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve? yet one of you is a spy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He meant Judas Iscariot, son of Simon; for it was he who was to betray him, though he was one of the twelve.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
