Were it otherwise, I would have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I go to prepare a place for you: and after I shall have gone, and prepared a place for you; I will return and take you with me, that where I am, there you may be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And whither I am going, you know, and the way you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thomas said to him, Master, we know not whither you are going. How, then, can we know the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus answered, I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no man comes to the Father, but by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Had you known me, you would have known my Father also; and henceforth you know him, and have seen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philip said to him, Master, show us the Father, and it will satisfy us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus replied, Have I been with you so long, and do you not yet know me, Philip? He that has seen me, has seen the Father. How do you say, then, Show us the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words which I speak to you proceed not form myself: as to the works, it is the Father dwelling in me who does them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; if not on my testimony, be convinced by the works themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes on me, shall himself do such works as I do; nay, even greater than these shall he do; because I go to my Father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and will do whatsoever you shall ask in my name. That the Father may be glorified in the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whatsoever you shall ask in my name, I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If you love me, keep my commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and I will entreat the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to continue with you forever;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world can not receive, because it neither sees him, nor knows him; but you shall know him, because he will abide with you, and be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you forlorn; I will return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet a little while, and the world shall see me no more; but you shall see me; because I live, you also shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me; and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is who loves me; and he who loves me, will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, Master, wherefore will you manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answering, said to him, If a man love me, he will observe my word; and my Father will love him; and we will come to him, and dwell with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who loves me not, disregards my words; yet the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father's, who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I tell you these things, while I remain with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things, and remind you of all that I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave you; my peace I give you; not as the world gives, do I give to you. Be not disheartened; be not intimidated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have heard me say, I go away, and will return to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice that I go to the Father; because my Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This I tell you now, before it happens, that when it happens, you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I shall not, henceforth, have much conversation with you; for the prince of the world is coming, though he will find nothing in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but this must be that the world may know that I love the Father, and do whatsoever he commands me. Arise, let us go hence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
