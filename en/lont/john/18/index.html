Jesus replied, I am he. Now Judas, who betrayed him, was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He had no sooner said to them, I am he, than they, going backward, fell to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He, therefore, asked them again, Whom do you seek? They said, Jesus, the Nazarene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered, I have told you, that I am he. If, therefore, you seek me, let these go away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus was that which he had spoken verified, Of those whom thou gavest me, I have lost none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus then said to Peter, Put up the sword into the scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the cohort, and their commander, and the Jewish officers, apprehended Jesus; and having bound him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>brought him first to Annas, because he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was Caiaphas, who had said in council to the Jews, It is expedient that one man die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Meantime Simon Peter, and another disciple, followed Jesus. That disciple, being known to the high priest, entered his court with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter stood without, at the door. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and brought in Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the maid, the portress, said to Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples? He answered, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now, the servants and the officers, stood near a fire, which they had made, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the high priest interrogated Jesus concerning his disciples and his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered, I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple, whither the Jews constantly resort. I said nothing in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why do you examine me? Examine them who heard me teach. They know what I said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he had spoken thus, one of the officers who attended, gave him a blow, and said, Do you answer the high priest thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus replied, If I have spoken amiss, show in what the wrong consists: but if well, why do you smite me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As Peter stood warming himself, they asked him, Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman to him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peter denied again; and immediately the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the praetorium: it was now morning; but the Jews entered not the praetorium, lest they should be defiled, and so not in a condition to eat the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Pilate, therefore, went out to them, and said, Of what do you accuse this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered, If he were not a criminal, we would not have delivered him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pilate said, Then take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews replied, We are not permitted to put any man to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And thus, what Jesus had spoken, signifying what death he should die, was accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Pilate returned to the praetorium, and having called Jesus, said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered, Do you say this of yourself, or did others tell you concerning me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate replied, Am I am Jew? Your own nation, yes, the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my adherents would have fought to prevent my falling into the hands of the Jews; but my kingdom is not hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Pilate said, You are a King, then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a King. For this I was born; and for this I came into the world, to give testimony to the truth. Whosoever is of the truth, hearkens to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate asked him, What is truth? and so saying, went out again to the Jews, and said to them, For my part, I find nothing culpable in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But since it is customary that I release to you one at the passover, will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then they all cried, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
