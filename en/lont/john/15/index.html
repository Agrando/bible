He who abides in me, and in whom I abide, produces much fruit; for, severed from me, you can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If any man abide not in me, he is cast forth like withered branches, which are gathered for fuel, and burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you may ask what you will, and it shall be granted you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In this is my Father glorified, that you produce much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father loves me, so do I love you: continue in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you keep my commandments, you shall continue in my love; as I have kept my Father's commandments, and continue in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I give you these admonitions, that I may continue to have joy in you, and that your joy may be complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I love you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No man has greater love than this, to lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his master will do: but I name you friends; for whatever I have learned from my Father, I impart to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It is not you who have chosen me; but it is I who have chosen you, and ordained you to go and bear fruit: fruit which will prove permanent, that the Father may give you whatsoever you shall ask him in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This I command you, that you love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hate you, consider that it hated me, before it hated you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, I having selected you from the world, the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember what I said to you, The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have observed my word, they will also observe yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all this treatment they will give you on my account, because they know not him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come, and spoken to them, they had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that hates me, hates my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them such works as none other ever did, they had not had sin; but now they have seen them, and yet hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>«Thus they verify that passage in their law,'They hated me without cause.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the Advocate is come, whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will testify concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you also will testify, because you have been with me from the beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
