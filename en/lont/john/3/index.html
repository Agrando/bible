Can he enter his mother's womb anew, and be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a man be born of water and Spirit, he can not enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wonder not, then, that I have said to you, You must be born again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Spirit breathes where he pleases, and you hear the report of him, but know not whence he comes, or whither he goes; so is every one who is born of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered, How can these things be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus replied, Are you the teacher of Israel, and know not these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; yet you receive not our testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If you understood not, when I told you earthly things, how will you understand when I tell you heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For none has ascended into heaven, but he who descended from heaven; the Son of Man, whose abode is heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As Moses placed on high the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be placed on high;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but obtain eternal life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for God has so loved the world, as to give his own begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him, may not perish, but obtain eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God has sent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world may be saved by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who believes on him shall not be condemned; he who believes not, is already condemned, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now this is the ground of condemnation; that light has come into the world, and men have preferred the darkness to the light, because their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For whosoever does evil, hates the light, and shuns it, lest his deeds should be detected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he who obeys the truth, comes to the light, that it may be manifest that his actions are agreeable to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After this, Jesus went, with his disciples, into the territory of Judea, where he remained with them, and immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>John also was immersing in Enon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came thither, and were immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For John was not yet cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now John's disciples had a dispute with a Jew, about purification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they went to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you near the Jordan, of whom you gave so great a character; he, too, immerses, and the people flock to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered, A man can have no power but what he derives from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves are witness for me, that I said, I am not the Messiah; but am sent before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bridegroom is he who has the bride; but the friend of the bridegroom, who assists him, rejoices to hear the bridegroom's voice: this, my joy, therefore, is complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must increase, while I decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He who comes from above, is above all. He who is from the earth is earthly, and speaks as being from the earth. He who comes from heaven, is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What he testifies, is what he has seen and heard; yet his testimony is not received.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He who receives his testimony, vouches the veracity of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>for he whom God has commissioned, relates God's own words; for to him God gives not the Spirit by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son, and has subjected all things to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who believes on the Son, has life eternal; he who rejects the Son, shall not see life: but the vengeance of God awaits him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
