And Jesus, wearied with the journey, sat down by the well, it being about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A woman of Samaria, having come to draw water, Jesus said to her, Give me some drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(for his disciples were gone into the city to buy food;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>the Samaritan woman answered, How is it, that you, who are a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a Samaritan? (For the Jews have no friendly intercourse with the Samaritans.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus replied, If you knew the bounty of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me some drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She answered, Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep: whence, then, have you the living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus replied, Whosoever drinks of this water, will thirst again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but whosoever will drink of the water which I shall give him, will never thirst more; but the water which I shall give him, will be in him a fountain, springing up to everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman answered, Sir, give me this water, that I may never be thirsty, nor come hither to draw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She answered, I have no husband. Jesus replied, You say well, I have no husband;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have, is not your husband. In this, you have spoken truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place, where me ought to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered, Woman, believe me, the time approaches when you shall neither come to this mountain, nor go to Jerusalem, to worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You worship what you know not, we worship what we know: for salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the time comes, or, rather, is come, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such are the worshipers whom the Father requires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman replied, I know that the Messiah comes, (that is, Christ;) when he is come, he will teach us all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to her, I who speak to you, am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Upon this, his disciples came, and wondered that he talked with a woman; yet none of them said, What do you seek? or, Why do you talk with her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then the woman left her pitcher, and having gone into the city, said to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Come, see a man who has told me all that I ever did. Is this not the Messiah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They, accordingly, went out of the city, and came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Meanwhile, the disciples entreating him, said, Rabbi, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He answered, I have food to eat which you know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then said his disciples, one to another, Has any man brought him food?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered, My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say, After four months comes harvest? But I say, Lift up your eyes, and survey the fields; for they are already white enough for harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The reaper receives wages, and gathers the fruits of eternal life, that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For in this, the proverb is verified, One sows, and another reaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap that on which you have bestowed no labor: others labored, and you get possession of their labors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now, many Samaritans of that city believed him, on the testimony of the woman, who said, He told me all that ever I did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When, therefore, they came to him, they besought him to stay with them; and he staid there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed, because of what they heard from himself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they said to the woman, It is not, now, on account of what you have reported, that we believe; for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is truly the Saviour of the world, the Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After the two days, Jesus departed, and went to Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for he had himself declared that a prophet is not regarded in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Being come into Galilee, he was well received by the Galileans, who had seen all that he did at Jerusalem, during the festival; for they likewise attended the festival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Jesus returned to Cana, of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain officer of the court, whose son lay sick at Capernaum,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and entreated him to come and cure his son, who was dying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and prodigies, you will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The officer answered, Come, Sir, before my child die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus replied, Go your way. Your son is well. And the man believed the word which Jesus had spoken, and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>As he was returning, his servants met him, and informed him that his son was well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He then inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They answered, Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then the father knew, that it was the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son is well; and he, and all his family, believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This second miracle Jesus performed, after returning from Judea to Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
