If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not: because he sees the light of the world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but if he walk in the night, he stumbles; because there is no light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Having spoken this, he added, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go to wake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said his disciples, Master, if he sleep, he will recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus spoke of his death; but they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And on your account I am glad that I was not there, that you may believe; but let us go to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Thomas, that is, Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us go, that we may die with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been already four days in the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now, (Bethany being about fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>many of the Jews came to Martha, and Mary, to comfort them on the death of their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Martha having heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him; but Mary remained in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Martha said to Jesus, Master, if you had been here, my brother had not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I know that even now, whatever you shall ask of God, God will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha replied, I know that he will rise at the resurrection, on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes on me, though he were dead, shall live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and no man who lives and believes on me, shall ever die. Do you believe this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She answered, Yes, Master, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, He who comes into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Having said this, she went and called Mary, her sister, aside, saying, The Teacher is come, and calls for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When Mary heard this, she instantly rose and went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews, then, who were condoling with Mary in the house, when they saw that she arose hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Mary being come to the place where Jesus was, and seeing him, threw herself at his feet, saying, Had you be here, Master, my brother had not died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping, who came with her, he groaned deeply, and was troubled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and said, Where have you laid him? They answered, and said, Master, come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Jews, therefore, said, Mark how he loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But some of them said, Could not he who gave sight to the blind man, even have prevented this man's death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus, therefore, again, groaning, came to the tomb. It was a cave, the entrance of which was shut up with a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, Remove the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, answered, Sir, by this time, the smell is offensive, for this is the fourth day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus replied, Did I not say to you, If you believe, you shall see the glory of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they removed the stone. And Jesus, lifting up his eyes, said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>As for me, I know that thou hearest me always; but I speak, for the people's sake who surround me, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After these words, raising his voice, he cried, Lazarus, come forth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He who had been dead, came forth, bound hand and foot with fillets, and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many, therefore, of the Jews, who had come to Mary, and seen what he did, believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of the repaired to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled the Sanhedrim, and said, What are we doing? for this man works many miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him go on thus, every one will believe on him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and our nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>One of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You are utterly at a loss,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and do not consider, that it is better for us that one man die for the people, than that the whole nation should be ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>This he spoke, not of himself; but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not for that nation only, but that he should assemble into one body the dispersed children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>From that day, therefore, they concerted how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>For that reason, Jesus appeared no longer publicly among the Jews, but retired to the country, near the desert, to a city called Ephraim; and continued there with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Meantime, the Jewish passover approached, and many went to Jerusalem from the country, before the passover, to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>These inquired after Jesus, and said, one to another, as they stood in the temple, What do you think? Will he not come to the festival?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had issued an order, that whosoever knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might apprehend him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
