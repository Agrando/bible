When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>he acknowledged, and denied not, but acknowledged, saying, I am not the Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, Who, then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the prophet? He answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said, Tell, then, who you are, that we may return an answer to them who sent us. What do you say of yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>«He answered, I am he whose voice proclaims in the wilderness,» 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' 'as said, the Prophet Isaiah.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now they who were sent, were of the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they questioned him further, Why, then, do you immerse, if you be not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered, I immerse in water, but there is one among you whom you know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is he who comes after me, and was before me; whose shoe-string I am not worthy to loose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This happened at Bethabara, upon the Jordan, where John was immersing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>On the next day, John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is He, concerning whom I said, After me a man comes, who is preferred to me; for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for me, I knew him not; but, that he might be made manifest to Israel, I am come immersing in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>John testified further, saying, I saw the spirit descending from heaven, like a dove, and remaining upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For my part, I should not have known him, had not He, who sent me to immerse in water, told me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining, the same is He who immerses in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Having, therefore, seen this, I testify that he is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The next day, John, being with two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>observed Jesus passing, and said, Behold the Lamb of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The two disciples hearing this, followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jesus turning about, saw them following, and said to them, What do you seek? They answered, Rabbi, (which signifies Teacher,) where do you dwell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He replied, Come, and see. They went, and saw where he dwelt, and it being about the tenth hour, abode with him that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two, who, having heard John, followed Jesus, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The first he met, was his own brother, Simon; to whom he said, We have found the Messiah, (a name equivalent to Christ.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus, looking upon him, said, You are Simon, the son of Jona; you shall be called Cephas, (which denotes the same as Peter.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The next day, he resolved to go to Galilee, and meeting Philip, said to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip meets Nathanael, and says to him, We have found the person described by Moses in the law, and by the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Nathanael says to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip answered, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said, concerning him, Behold an Israelite, indeed, in whom is no guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael said to him, Whence do you know me? Jesus answered, I saw you when you were under the fig tree, before Philip called you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael replying, said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered him, saying, Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, you believe!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He added, Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending from the Son of Man, and descending to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
