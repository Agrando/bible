As she wept, stooping down to look into the sepulcher,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>she saw two angles in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head, the other at the feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She answered, Because they have taken away my Master, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Having said this, she turned about, and saw Jesus standing, but knew not that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus aid to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? She, supposing him to be the gardener, answered, Sir, if you have conveyed him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, Mary. She, turning, said to him, Rabboni; that is, Teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary, the Magdalene, went and informed the disciples, that she had seen the Master, and that he had spoken these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the evening of that day, the first of the week, Jesus came where the disciples were convened, (the doors having been shut, for the fear of the Jews,) and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Having said this, he showed them his hand and his side. The disciples, therefore, rejoiced when they saw it was their Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said again to them, Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, so do I send you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these words, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whose sins soever you remit, are remitted to them; and whose sins soever you retain, are retained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now, Thomas, that is, Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them, when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The other disciples, therefore, said to him, We have seen the Master. But he answered, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger to the print of the nails, and my hand to his side, I will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Eight days after, the disciples being again in the house, and Thomas with them, Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then turning to Thomas, Reach hither your finger, he said, and look at my hands; reach also your hand, and feel my side; and be not incredulous, but believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thomas answered, My Lord, and my God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus replied, Because you see me, you believe; happy they, who, having never seen, shall nevertheless believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Many other miracles Jesus likewise performed in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But these are recorded, that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God; and, that believing, you may have life through his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
