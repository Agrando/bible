Some said, He is a good man. Others, No; he seduces the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No person, however, spoke freely of him, for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>About the middle of the festival, Jesus went into the temple, and was teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews said with astonishment, Whence comes this man's learning, who was never taught?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus made answer, My doctrine is not mine, but his who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any one will do his will, he shall discern whether my doctrine proceeds from God, or from myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whosoever teaches what proceeds from himself, seeks to promote his own glory: whosoever seeks to promote the glory of him who sent him, deserves credit, and is a stranger to deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered, You are possessed. Who seeks to kill you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus replied, I have performed one action, which surprises you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses instituted circumcision among you, (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs,) and you circumcise on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If, on the Sabbath, a man receive circumcision, that the law of Moses may not be violated; are you incensed against me, because, on the Sabbath, I have cured a man, whose whole body was disabled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge not from personal regards, but judge according to justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then some inhabitants of Jerusalem, said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lo! he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers, indeed, acknowledge that this is the Messiah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But we know whence this man is; whereas, when the Messiah shall come, no person will know whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus, who was then teaching in the temple, cried, Do you know both who, and whence I am? I came not of myself. But he is true, who sent me, whom you know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As for me, I know him, because I came from him, and am commissioned by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they sought to apprehend him, but none laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Many of the people, however, believed on him, and said, When the Messiah shall come, will he do more miracles than this man does?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When the Pharisees heard that the people muttered such things concerning him, they and the chief priests dispatched officers to seize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus, therefore, said, Yet a little while I remain with you; then I go to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You shall seek me, but shall not find me; nor be able to come where I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews said, among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What does he mean, by saying, You shall seek me, but shall not find me, nor be able to get thither, where I shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the last, and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He who believes on me, as the scripture says, shall be like a cistern, whence rivers of living waters shall flow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>This he spoke of the Spirit, which they who believed on him were to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Many of the people having heard what was spoken, said, This is certainly the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Some said, This is the Messiah. Others, does the Messiah come from Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Does not the scripture say, that the Messiah will be of the posterity of David, and come from Bethlehem, the village whence David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Thus the people were divided concerning him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and some of them would have seized him, but no person laid hands upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, Wherefore have you not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees replied, Are you also seduced?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Has any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees, believed on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this populace, which knows not the law, is accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus, one of themselves, (he who came to Jesus by night,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>said to them, Does our law permit us to condemn a man, without hearing him, and knowing what he has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered him, Are you also a Galilean? Search, and you will find that prophets arise not out of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then every man went to his own house;</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
