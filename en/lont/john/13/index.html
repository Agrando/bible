Jesus answered, Unless I wash you, you can have no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said to him, Master, not my feet only; but also my hands and my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus replied, He who has been bathing, needs only to wash his feet; the rest of his body being clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You are clean, but not all. For he knew who would betray him; therefore he said, You are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After he had washed their feet, he put on his mantle, and replacing himself at table, said to them, Do you understand what I have been doing to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me the Teacher and the Master; and you say right; for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I, then, the Master and the Teacher, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, the servant is not greater than his master, nor is the apostle greater than he who sends him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Happy are you, who know these things, provided you practice them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>«I speak not of you all. I know whom I have chosen: but the scripture must be fulfilled,'He that eats at my table, has lifted up his heel against me.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I tell you this now, before it happen; that when it happens, you may believe that I am the Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, he that receives whomsoever I send, receives me; and he that receives me, receives him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After uttering these words, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, saying, Most assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the disciples looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now one of his disciples, one whom Jesus loved, was lying close to his breast:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter, therefore, made a sign to him, to inquire whom he meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He, then, reclining on Jesus' bosom, said to him, Master, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give this morsel, after I have dipped it. And having dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After receiving the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But none at the table knew, why he gave this order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Some imagined, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had signified to him to buy necessaries for the festival; or, to give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Judas had taken the morsel, he immediately went out: and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When he was gone, Jesus said, the Son of Man is now glorified, and God is glorified by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God is glorified by him, God also will glorify him by himself, and that without delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>My children, I have now but a little time to be with you. You will seek me, and what I said to the Jews, Whither I go, you can not come; I say at present to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give you, that you love one another; that as I have loved you, you also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall all men know, that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said to him, Master, whither are you going? Jesus answered, Whither I am going, you can not follow me now; but afterward you shall follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter replied, Master, why can not I follow you presently? I will lay down my life for your sake!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Most assuredly, I say to you, the cock shall not crow, till you have disowned me thrice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
