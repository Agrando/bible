I did not, indeed, mention them at the beginning, because I was with you myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now I go away to him who sent me; yet none of you ask me, Whither do you go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because of those things which I have foretold you, you are overwhelmed with grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless, I tell you the truth; it is for your good that I depart; for if I do not depart, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go away, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he is come, he will convince the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>concerning sin, because they believe not on me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>concerning righteousness because I go to my Father, and you see me no longer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>concerning judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have many things still to tell you, but you can not yet bear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will conduct you into all the truth: for his words will not proceed from himself: but whatsoever he shall have heard, he will speak, and show you things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me: for he will take of mine and communicate to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whatsoever is the Father's, is mine; therefore, I say that he will take of mine to communicate to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while you shall not see me; a little while after, you shall see me; because I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Some of the disciples said among themselves, What does he mean by this; a little while you shall not see me; a little while after, you shall see me; because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What means this little while, of which he speaks? We do not comprehend it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus perceiving that they were desirous to ask him, said to them, Do you inquire among yourselves about this that I said, A little while you shall not see me; a little while after, you shall see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice: you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come. But when her son is born, she remembers her anguish no longer; for joy that she has brought a man into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So, you, at present, are in grief; but I will visit you again, and your hearts shall be joyful, and none shall rob you of your joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On that day, you will put no questions to me. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatsoever you shall ask the Father, in my name, he will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things I have spoken to you in figures: the time approaches when I shall no more discourse to you in figures, but instruct you plainly concerning the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The you will ask in my name, and I say not, that I will entreat the Father for you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me, and believed that I came from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>From the presence of the Father I cam into the world. Again, I leave the world, and return to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples replied, Now, indeed, you speak plainly, and without a figure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we are convinced that you know all things, and need not that any should put questions to you. By this we believe that you came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered, Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the time comes, or rather is come, when you shall disperse, every one to his own, and shall leave me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage! I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
