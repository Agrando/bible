They answered, We will go with you. Immediately they went, and got aboard a bark, but that night caught nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In the morning Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples, however, knew not that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus said to them, My children, have you any victuals? They answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Cast the net, cried he, on the right side of the bark, and you will find. They did so, but were not able to draw it, by reason of the multitude of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, It is the Master. Simon Peter, hearing that it was the Master, girt on his upper garment (which was laid aside) and threw himself into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the other disciples came in the boat, (for they were not farther from land than about two hundred cubits,) dragging the net, with the fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they came ashore, they saw a fire burning, and a fish laid on it, and bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to them, Bring of the fishes which you have now taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Simon Peter went back, and drew the net to land, full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and the net was not rent, notwithstanding the number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus said to them, Come and dine. Meantime none of the disciples ventured to ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus drew near, and taking bread and fish, distributed among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is the third time that Jesus appeared to his disciples, after his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me more than these? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A second time he said, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you. Jesus replied, Tend my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A third time he said, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? Peter, grieved at his asking this question a third time, answered, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus replied, Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, in your youth you girt yourself, and went whither you would; but in your old age, you shall stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you whither you would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This he spoke, signifying by what death he should glorify God. After these words, he said to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Peter turning about, saw the disciple, whom Jesus loved, following, (the same who, leaning on his breast at the supper, had asked who it was, that would betray him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, And what, Lord, shall become of this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus answered, If I will that he wait my return, what is that to you? Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Hence arose the rumor among the brethren, that that disciple should not die; nevertheless, Jesus said not, that he should not die; but, If I will, that he wait my return, what is that to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It is this disciple, who attests these things, and wrote this account; and we know that his testimony deserves credit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There were many other things also performed by Jesus, which, were they to be severally related, I imagine, the world itself could not contain the volumes that would be written.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
