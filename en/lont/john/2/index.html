My time is not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother said to the servants, Do whatever he shall bid you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were six water pots of stone, containing two or three baths each, placed there for the Jewish rites of cleansing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to them, Fill the pots with water. And they filled them to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said, Draw, now, and carry to the director of the feast. And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the director of the feast had tasted the wine made of water, not knowing whence it was, (but the servants who drew the water knew,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he said, addressing the bridegroom, Every person presents the best wine first, and worse wine afterward, when the guests have drunk largely; but you have reserved the best till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This first miracle Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee, displaying his glory: and his disciples believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Afterward, he went to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; but they staid not there many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Jewish passover being nigh, Jesus went to Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and finding changers sitting in the temple, and people who sold cattle and sheep, and doves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and cattle, scattering the coin of the changers, and oversetting their tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he said to them, who sold doves, Take these things hence.
