His own sheep he calls by name, and leads out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And having put out his sheep, he walks before them, and they follow him; because they know his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They will not follow a stranger, but flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus addressed this similitude to them, but they did not comprehend what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He therefore added, Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the gate of the fold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All who preceded me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep obeyed them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the gate: such as enter by me shall be safe: they shall go in and out, and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief comes in only to steal, to slay, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The hireling, who is not the shepherd, and to whom the sheep do not belong, when he sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and flees; and the wolf tears them, and disperses the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd. And I know my own, and am known by them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>(even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father;) and I give my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I have other sheep, besides, which are not of this fold. Them I must also bring; and they will obey my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this the Father loves me, because I give my life, to be afterward resumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one forces it from me: but I give it of myself. I have power to give it, and I have power to resume it. This commandment I have received from my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again there was a division among the Jews, occasioned by this discourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them said, He has a demon, and is mad: why do you hear him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These are not the words of a demonize. Can a demon give sight to the blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Afterward, when they were celebrating the feast of the dedication, at Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>it being in winter; as Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon's portico,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the Jews surrounding him, said to him, How long will you keep us in suspense? If you be the Messiah, tell us plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered, I told you; but you believed not. The works which I do in my Father's name, testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you believe not, for you are not of my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep, as I told you, obey my voice; I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides, I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any one wrest them out of my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who gave them me, is greater than all; and none can wrest them out of my Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Jews again took up stones to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus said to them, Many good works I have shown you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered, For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>«Jesus replied, Is it not written in your law,'I said, You are gods?'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If the law styled them gods, to whom the word of God was addressed, and if the language of scripture in unexceptionable;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you charge him with blasphemy whom the Father has consecrated his Apostle to the world, for calling himself his Son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works, that you may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I am in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They then attempted again to seize him; but he escaped out of their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and retired again toward the Jordan, and abode in the place where John first immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many resorted to him, who said, John, indeed, wrought no miracle: but all that John spoke of this man, is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed on him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
