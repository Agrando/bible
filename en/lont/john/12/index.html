She has reserved this to embalm me, against the day of my burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For you will always have the poor among you; but me you will not always have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A great number of the Jews, knowing where he was, flocked thither, not on account of Jesus only, but likewise to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The chief priests, therefore, determined to kill Lazarus also;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because he proved the occasion that many Jews forsook them, and believed on Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the next day, a great multitude, who were come to the festival, hearing that Jesus was on the road to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>took branches of palm trees, and went out to meet him, crying, Hosanna! blessed be Israel's King, who comes in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now Jesus having found a young ass, was riding on it, agreeably to what is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>«Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These things the disciples did not understand, at first; but after Jesus was glorified, they remembered that thus it had been written concerning him, and that thus they had done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the people who had been present, attested that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It was the rumor that he had wrought this miracle, which made the people crowd to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves, Are you not sensible that you have no influence? Behold the world is gone after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, among those who came to worship at the festival, there were some Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These applied to Philip, of Bethsaida, in Galilee, making this request, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered them, saying, The time is come, when the Son of Man must be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Most assuredly, I say to you, when a grain of wheat is thrown into the ground, unless it die, it remains single; but if it die, it becomes very fruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who loves his life shall lose it; and he who hates his life in this world, shall preserve it eternally in the next.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Would any man serve me? let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant also be. If any man serve me, my Father will reward him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But I came on purpose for this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify thy name. Then came a voice out of heaven, which said, I have both glorified, and will again glorify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The people present heard the sound, and said, It thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said, This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now must this world be judged. Now must the prince of this world be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As for me, when I shall be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>This he said, alluding to the death which he was to suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The people answered, We have learned from the law, that the Messiah will live forever. How do you say, then, that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the light continues with you; walk, while you have it, lest darkness overtake you: for he that walks in darkness knows not whither he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Confide in the light, while you enjoy it, that you may be sons of light. Having spoken these words, he withdrew himself privately from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But, though he had performed so many miracles before them, they believed not on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>«so that the word of the Prophet Isaiah was verified,» 'Lord, who has believed out report?' 'and, '«To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For this reason they could not believe; Isaiah having said, also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>«He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their understanding, that they might not see with their eyes, comprehend with their understanding, and be converted, that I might heal them.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless, there were several, even of the magistrates, who believed on him; but, for fear of the Pharisees, did not avow it, lest they should be expelled the synagogue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they preferred approbation of men to the approbation of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then Jesus, raising his voice, said, He who believes on me, believes not on me only; but on him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he who beholds me, beholds him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me, may not remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if any man hear my words, but do not observe them; it is not I, who condemn him; for I came, not to condemn the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who despises me, and rejects my instructions, has that which condemns him. The doctrine which I have taught will condemn him at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not said anything from myself; but the Father who sent me, has commanded me what I should enjoin, and what I should teach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know, that his commandment is eternal life. Whatever, therefore, I say, I speak as the Father has given me in charge.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
