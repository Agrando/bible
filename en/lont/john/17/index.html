They were thine; and thou hast given them to me; and they have kept thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Whatsoever thou hast given me, they now know to have come from thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and that thou hast imparted to me the doctrine, which I have imparted to them. They have received it, knowing for certain, that I came forth from thee, and am commissioned by thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It is for them that I pray. I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; because they are thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all mine are thine, and thine mine, and I am glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I continue no longer in the world; but these continue in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, preserve them in thy name, whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name; those whom thou hast given me, I have preserved.
