We have injured no one; we have corrupted no one; we have defrauded no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I speak not this to condemn you; for I have said before, that you are in our hearts, to die and live with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Great is my freedom of speech to you; great is my boasting concerning you: I am filled with consolation, I exceedingly abound in joy in all our affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh has no rest, but we were distressed on every side; without were fightings- within were fears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Nevertheless, God, who comforts them who are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>(not, indeed, by his coming only; but more especially by the consolation with which he was comforted by you) -when he told us your earnest desire, your lamentation, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore, though I made you sorry by the letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that that letter, though suitable to the occasion, made you sorry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I now rejoice; not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow produced reformation: for you were made to sorrow in a godly manner, that you might be injured by us in nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For godly sorrow produces a reformation to salvation, never to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world produces death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, now, this very thing-your being made sorry with a godly sorrow-what carefulness it wrought in you; yes, what clearing of yourselves; yes, what indignation; yes, what fear; yes, what earnest desire; yes, what zeal; yes, what revenge! Upon the whole, you have showed yourselves to be pure in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, indeed, though I wrote to you, it was not for his sake who did the wrong, nor for his sake who suffered it; but rather, that our care for you, in the presence of God might be manifested to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this reason, we were comforted in your comfort: yes, we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That if I have boasted anything to him concerning you, I am not ashamed: for, as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so, also, our boasting to Titus is verified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his tender affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembers the obedience of you all, and how you received him with fear and trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
