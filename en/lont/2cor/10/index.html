And I request that, when present I may not be bold with that confidence with which I conclude to be bold against some, who conclude us to be really persons who walk according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>(for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but exceeding powerful for the overturning of strongholds;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>overturning reasonings, and every high thing raised up against the knowledge of God; and leading captive every thought to the obedience of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and are prepared to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do you look on things according to appearance? If any one is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him, on the other hand, reason this from himself, that he is Christ's, so, also, are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And, therefore, I should not be ashamed, if I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord has given us for your edification, and not for your destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>(for his letters, says one, are indeed weighty and strong; but his bodily presence weak, and his speech contemptible;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>let such a one conclude this, that such as we are in speech by letters, when absent, the same, also, when present, we will be in deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But we dare not rank and compare ourselves with some who commend themselves: however, they, among themselves, measuring themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, do not understand themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Further, we will not boast of things not measured according to the line of measure, which the God of measure has allotted to us, to reach even to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we do not stretch ourselves beyond our line, as not reaching to you; (but we are come as far as to you also, in the gospel of Christ.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We do not boast of things not measured, that is, of other men's labors; but we have hope when your faith is increased, to be by you abundantly enlarged with respect to our line;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to declare the gospel in the regions beyond you; and not in another man's line, to boast of things already prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He, then, who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For not he who commends himself is approved; but whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
