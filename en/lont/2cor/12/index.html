You have constrained me to it; for I ought to have been commended by you, because I am in nothing behind the very greatest Apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of an Apostle were fully wrought among you with all patience, by signs and wonders, and powers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is the thing in which you were inferior to other congregations, unless that I myself have not been burdensome to you? Forgive me this injury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, a third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you; because I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yes, I most gladly will spend and be spent for the sake of your souls; even though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be it so, then, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>With respect to any one of them I sent to you, did I by him make gain of you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I besought Titus to go to you; and with him I sent a brother: did Titus make any gain of you? Did we not walk in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, do you think that we apologize to you? In the presence of God we speak in Christ, that all these things, beloved, are done for your edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet I am afraid, lest, perhaps, when I come, I shall not find you such as I wish: and that I shall be found by you, such as you do not wish: -lest, perhaps, there be among you strifes, emulations, wraths, brawlings, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And lest, when I come again, my God may humble me among you; and I shall bewail many, who have formerly sinned, and have not reformed from the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, which they have committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
