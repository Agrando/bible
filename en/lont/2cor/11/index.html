But upon the whole, we have been made manifest to you in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Have I committed an offense in humbling myself that you might be exalted; because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I robbed other congregations, taking wages of them to do you service;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for being present with you, and in want, we were burdensome to no one; but what I wanted, the brethren from Macedonia supplied: and in everything I have kept, and will keep myself from being burdensome to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Is the truth in me? then this my boasting shall not be prevented in the regions of Achaia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For what reason? because I do not love you? God knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off opportunity from them who desire opportunity; that in what they boast, they may be found even as we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such are false Apostles, deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into Apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder; for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, it is no great wonder if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness: whose end shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover, I say, let no one think me a fool; but, if otherwise, at least, as a fool, bear with me, that I also may boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I speak in this confident boasting, I do not speak according to the Lord; but as in foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, being wise, you bear with fools cheerfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if one enslave you, you bear it; if one devour you, if one take your goods, if one exalt himself, if one strike you on the face-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak of reproach, as, that we are weak. But, in whatever any one is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I am above them: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>of the Jews, five times I received forty stripes, save one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stone, thrice I was ship-wrecked: I have spent a night and a day in the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In journeys often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the heathens, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In labor and toil; in watching often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides these troubles from without, that which is my daily pressure, the anxious care of all the congregations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I do not burn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must boast, I will boast of the things which relate to my weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for ever, knows that I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas, intending to apprehend me, guarded the city of the Damascenes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but I was let down in a basket, through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
