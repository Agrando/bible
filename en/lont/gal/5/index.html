Certainly the offense of the cross is abolished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I wish, indeed, they were cut off who subvert you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you, brethren, have been called into liberty; only use not this liberty for an occasion to the flesh; but through love, assiduously serve one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>«For the whole law is fulfilled by one precept, even by this,» 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another, take care lest you be consumed by one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say, then, walk by the Spirit, and you will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things you would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these. Fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>sorcery, enmities, strifes, emulations, wraths, brawlings, factions, sects,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envying, murders, intoxications, revellings, and such like: concerning which I foretell you now, as I also have foretold, that they who practice these things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, fidelity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>meekness, temperance: against such things there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Besides, they who are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with the passions and lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Since we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not be vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
