He does not say,» 'And in seeds,' 'as concerning many; but as concerning one person, '«And in your see,» 'who is Christ.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wherefore, this I affirm, that the Will which was before ratified by God concerning Christ, the law, which was made four hundred and thirty years after can not annul, so as to abolish the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Besides, if the inheritance be by law, it is no longer by promise. But God bestowed it freely on Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why, then, the law? It was added on account of transgression, till the seed should come to whom it was promised; being ordained by messengers, in the hand of a Mediator;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the Mediator is not one party; but God is one party.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the law, then, contrary to the promise of God? By no means. For if there had been a law given, which was able to make alive, certainly righteousness would have been by law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scripture has shut up together all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Wherefore, before faith came, we were kept in durance under law, shut up together to the faith, which should afterward be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So that the law has become our instructor to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But faith being come, we are no longer under this instructor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you are all the sons of God through the faith by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Besides, as many of you have been immersed into Christ, have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bondman nor freeman, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you are Christ's, certainly you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
