Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I wonder that you are so soon removed from him who called you into the favor of Christ, to another gospel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>which is not another: but there are some who trouble you, and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if even we, or an angel from heaven, declare a gospel to you, different from what we have declared to you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we said before, so now I say again, if any one declare a gospel to you, different from what you have received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For do I now conciliate men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now I certify you, brethren, concerning the gospel which was declared by me, that it is not according to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, except by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You have certainly heard of my behavior formerly in Judaism; that I exceedingly persecuted the congregation of God, and laid it waste;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and made progress in Judaism above many of the same age with myself, in my own nation, being more exceedingly jealous of the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his favor, was pleased</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son to me, that I might declare the good news concerning him to the Gentiles; immediately I did not consult flesh and blood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>neither did I go up to Jerusalem, to them who were Apostles before me; but I went away in Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then, after three years, I went up to Jerusalem, to become acquainted with Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I saw no other of the Apostles, except James, the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now as to the things which I write to you, behold, God is my witness that I do not falsely affirm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After that, I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I was personally unknown to the congregations of Judea which are in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They had only heard that-he who formerly persecuted us, now announces, as glad tidings, the faith which he formerly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they glorified God on my account.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
