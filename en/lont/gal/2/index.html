For they who were of reputation, communicated nothing to me.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, on the contrary, perceiving that I was entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, just as Peter was with that of the circumcision;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(for he who wrought effectually in Peter for the apostleship of the circumcision, also wrought effectually in me for the Gentiles):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>even James, and Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, having perceived the favor granted to me, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we, indeed, should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>requesting only, that we would remember the poor, which very thing I had also been diligent to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was to be blamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For, before certain persons came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew, and separated himself, being afraid of them of the circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the other Jews also dissembled with them, insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter, before them all-If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of the Gentiles, and not after the manner of the Jews, why do you compel the Gentiles to Judaize?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We, who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>knowing that man is not justified by works of law, but only through the faith of Jesus Christ; even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by works of law; for by works of law no flesh shall be justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if seeking to be justified by Christ, even we ourselves are found sinners, is Christ, then, the minister of sin? By no means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I constitute myself a transgressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Besides, I, through law, have died to law, that I might live to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I am crucified together with Christ. Nevertheless, I live; yet not longer I, but Christ lives in me: for the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith which is of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not set aside the favor of God. For if righteousness is through law, then certainly Christ has died in vain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
