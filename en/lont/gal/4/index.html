You have injured me in nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You know, indeed, that in weakness of the flesh, I declared the gospel to you at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet that trial of mine, which was in my flesh, you did not despise; neither did you reject me, but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What, then, was your happiness! for I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes, and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Am I, then, become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They love you ardently, not honorably. Yes, they wish to exclude us, that you may love them ardently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is honorable to be ardently in love with a good man at all times, and not merely when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My little children, for whom I travail in birth again till Christ be formed in you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I could wish, indeed, to be present with you now, and to change my speech; for I am exceedingly in doubt concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you who wish to be under the law, do you hear the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons: one by the bondmaid, and one by the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he, indeed, who was of the bondmaid, was begotten according to the flesh; but he who was of the free woman, was through the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things are allegorized: for these women are two institutions; the one, indeed, from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children into bondage, which is Hagar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(for the name of Hagar denotes Mount Sinai, in Arabia,) and she answers to the present Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem above, is the free woman, who is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>«For it is written,» 'Rejoice, O barren woman, who didst not bring forth! Break out and cry, thou who travailest not in birth; for more are the children of the deserted, than of her who had the husband.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We, therefore, brethren, like Isaac, are children by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But even as then, he who was begotten according to the flesh, persecuted him who was begotten according to the Spirit: so also now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>«But what says the scripture?» 'Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Well, then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondmaid, but of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
