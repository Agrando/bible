You are all partakers of my gratitude;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for God is my witness how vehemently I long after you all, with the tender affections of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And this I pray, that your love may yet abound more and more, with knowledge and with all discretion;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that you may approve the things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and inoffensive till the day of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>filled with the fruit of righteousness, which is through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now I wish you to know, brethren that the things which have befallen me, have turned out rather to the advancement of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So that my bonds are manifested to be on account of Christ, through the whole palace, and in all the other places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the greater number of the brethren in the Lord, made confident by my bonds, have become much more bold to speak the word without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Some, indeed, preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some, also, of good will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The latter, indeed, from love; knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the former preach Christ out of contention, not sincerely, thinking to add affliction to my bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What, then? Still in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; even in this I do rejoice; yes, and will rejoice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for I know that this will turn out to me for salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that agreeably to my earnest expectation and hope, in nothing I shall be ashamed; but that with all boldness, as at all times, so now, also, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But whether to live in the flesh would be to my advantage; or what to choose, I do not know:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for I am in a strait between the two, having a strong desire to depart and be with Christ, which is by far the better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And being firmly persuaded of this, I know that I shall live and abide some time with you all, for the advancement of the joy of your faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and that your boasting concerning me in Christ Jesus, may abound, through my coming again to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only behave in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ; that whether I shall come and see you, or, being absent, shall hear of your affairs, that you are steadfast in one spirit, with one soul striving together for the faith of the gospel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and not terrified in anything by your adversaries; which is to them a demonstration of perdition; but to you of salvation, and that from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to you it is graciously given, on the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the very same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
