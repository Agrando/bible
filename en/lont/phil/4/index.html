Everywhere, and by all means, I am silently taught what it is to be full, and to be hungry; to abound, and to suffer want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I can do all things, through him who strengthens me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless, you have done well in sympathizing with my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover, you Philippians also know, that, in the beginning of my labors in the gospel, when I departed for Macedonia, no congregation communicated with me, by giving and receiving, but you only;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that, also, when in Thessalonica, you sent once; yes, twice, to relieve my necessity-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>not that I earnestly seek the fruit, which abounds to your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I have received all, and abound; I have been fully supplied, having received by Epaphroditus the things sent from you, a fragrant odor, a sacrifice accepted; well pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But my God will fully supply all your wants, according to his riches in glory, through Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, to God, even our Father, be glory for ever and ever.
