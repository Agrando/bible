if any comfort of love; if any fellowship of the Spirit; if any sympathies and tender mercies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>complete this my joy, that you be likeminded; having the very same love, being unanimous, minding the one thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, but, in humbleness of mind esteem each other better that yourselves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>not aiming every one at his own interests, but every one also, at the interests of the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now let this disposition be in you which was also in Christ Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who, though he was in the form of God, did not affect to appear in divine majesty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but divested himself, taking upon him the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And for this reason, God has exceedingly exalted him, and has bestowed on him a name which is above every name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that, at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow; of those in heaven, and upon the earth, and under the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore, my beloved, since you have always obeyed, not in my presence only, but now much more in my absence; effectually work out your own salvation, with fear and trembling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for it is God who works effectually in you, both to will and to perform, on account of his benevolence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do all things without murmurings and disputings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that you may be blameless and harmless, the children of God, unblemished in the midst of a crooked and perverse race; among whom shine as lights in the world,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, nor have labored in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yes, and if I be made a drink-offering upon the sacrifice and ministry of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and for the same do you also joy and rejoice with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be of good courage, that I also may be of good courage, when I know your affairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no one like disposed, who will sincerely take care of your affairs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with a father, so he has served with me in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, indeed, I hope to send him immediately, as soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>However, I am fully persuaded by the Lord, that even I myself shall soon come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellowlabourer, and fellowsoldier; but your Apostle, and a minister to my want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he longed after you all, and was exceedingly grieved, because you had heard that he had been sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, indeed, he was sick nigh to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherefore I have sent him the more speedily, that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the more free from sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and have such persons in great estimation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because for the work of Christ, he drew nigh to death, not regarding his life, that he might fully supply the want of your service toward me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
