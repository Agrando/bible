Is the law sin? By no means. Indeed, I had not known sin, except by the law. For I had not known even inordinate desire, unless the law had said,» 'You shall not lust.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of inordinate desire: for without the law sin is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I was alive, once, without the law: but when the commandment came, sin revived, but I died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yes, the commandment which was for live, the very same was found to be death to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore, the law is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Has, then, that which is good become death to me? By no means. But sin becomes death, in order that it might manifest itself, causing death to me by that which is good: so that sin, (through the commandment,) might be an exceedingly great sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Besides, we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For that which I do, I do not approve; since it is not what I desire that I do: but I do that which I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If, now, I do that which I do not desire, I consent to the law that it is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But now it is no longer I myself who do this; but sin which dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells no good thing: for to desire what is good, is easy for me; but to do it, I find difficult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good which I desire, that I do not: but the evil which I desire not, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now, if I do that which I do not desire, it is no longer I who do it; but sin, which dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find, then, that it is a law to me, when desirous to do good, that evil is near me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I take pleasure in the law of God, as to the inner man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I perceive another law, in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and making me a captive to the law of sin, which is in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Wherefore, then, indeed, I myself serve, with my mind, the law of God; but with the flesh, the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
