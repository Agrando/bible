even as Christ also has received us to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now, I affirm that Jesus Christ became a minister of the circumcision on account of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises made to the fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>«and that the Gentiles might praise God on account of mercy: as it is written,» 'For this cause I will glorify thee among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>«And again he says,» 'Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>«And again,» 'Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; and extol him, all you people.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>«And again, Isaiah says, to be a leader of the Gentiles; upon him shall the Gentiles place their hope.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now, may the God of hope fill you with all joy, and peace, in believing; in order that you may abound in that hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However, my brethren, I myself am persuaded concerning you, that you also are full of goodness, being filled with all knowledge; able, also, to instruct one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, I have written the more boldly to you, brethren; partly, as calling things to your remembrance through the favor which is given me of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In order to my being a minister of Jesus Christ, among the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that there might be an offering of the Gentiles most acceptable; being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have, therefore, glorifying, through Christ Jesus, with respect to things pertaining to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, I will not dare to speak anything of what Christ has not wrought; but, of what he has wrought, by me, in order to the obedience of the Gentiles in word and deed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Holy Spirit: so that from Jerusalem, and round about, as far as Illyricum, I have fully declared the gospel of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and so, also, that I was strongly desirous to declare the gospel where Christ was not named, that I might not build on another's foundation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>«But, as it is written,» 'They shall see, to whom nothing has been told concerning him; and they who have not heard, shall understand.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For which reason, also, I have been greatly hindered from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now, having no more place in these parts, and having for many years a strong desire to come to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whensoever I go toward Spain, I hope, as I pass on, to see you, and to be brought on my way thither by you, when I shall first, in some measure, be satisfied with your company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor of the saints who are in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They have been pleased, indeed; and their debtors they are: for if the Gentiles have partaken of their spiritual things, they ought certainly to minister to them in temporal things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherefore, having finished this affair, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will go from thence by you into Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now, I beseech you, brethren, by the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me, by prayers for me to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from the disobedient in Judea; and that my service, which I am performing for Jerusalem, may be acceptable to the saints:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that in joy I may come to you, through the will of God, and may be refreshed among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now may the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
