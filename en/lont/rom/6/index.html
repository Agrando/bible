Shall we continue in sin, that favor may abound?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>By no means. How shall we, who have died to sin, continue to live in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know, that as many as have been immersed into Jesus Christ, have been immersed into his death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We have been buried, then, together with him, by the immersion into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father; so we also shall walk in newness of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death; we shall then, also, certainly be in the likeness of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we should not any longer serve sin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for he that has died is released from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies not again; death has no longer dominion over him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for that he has died, he has died for sin once: but that he lives, he lives for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So reckon yourselves also dead, indeed, to sin; but alive to God, by Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body, by obeying it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Neither present your members as instruments of unrighteousness, to sin; but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead; and your members as instruments of righteousness, to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Besides, sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under law, but under favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then do we say? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under favor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know, that to whom you present yourselves servants, by obedience; his servants you are whom you thus obey; whether of sin into death, or of obedience into righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, thanks to God, that though you were the servants of sin; yet you have heartily obeyed that model of doctrine to which you have been given up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And being made free from sin, you have become the servants of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh.) Wherefore, as you have presented your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity, to work iniquity; so present now your members, servants to righteousness, to work holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For when you were servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what fruit had you, then, from these things of which you are now ashamed? for the reward of these things is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now, being set free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit to holiness: and the end, everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the wages of sin is death: but the gracious gift of God is everlasting life, by Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
