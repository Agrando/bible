By no means. For, even I am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God has not cast off his people whom formerly he acknowledged. Do you not know, what the scripture says to Elijah; when he complains to God against Israel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>«Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and have digged down thy altars, and I am let alone, and they seek my life?»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>«But what says the answer to God to him?» 'I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So, then, even at this present time, there is a remnant according to an election by favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if by favor, it is no more of works: otherwise favor is no more favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? The thing Israel earnestly seeks, that he has not obtained. But the election has obtained it, and the rest are blinded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>«As it is written,» 'God has given them a spirit of deep sleep; eyes not seeing, and ears not hearing, until this present day.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>«And David says,» 'Let their table be for a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense to them.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened, so as not to see; and let them bow down their back continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I ask, then, have they stumbled, that they may fall? By no means. But, through their fall, salvation is given to the Gentiles, to excite them to emulation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now, if the fall of them be the riches of the world; and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now, I speak to you, Gentiles, (and inasmuch as I am the Apostle to the Gentiles, I do honor to my ministry,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if by any means I may excite to emulation my kindred, and may save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world; what will the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover, if the first fruit be holy, the mass is also holy; and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, if some of the branches were broken off, and you who are a wild olive, are engrafted among them, and are become a joint partaker of the root and fatness of the olive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>boast not against the branches: but if you boast, still, you bear not the root, but the root you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say, however, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>True: by unbelief they were broken off, and you by faith, stand. Be not high-minded, but fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For, if God spared not the natural branches; perhaps, neither will he spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, then, the goodness and severity of God! Toward them who fell, severity: but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise, you also shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And even they, if they continued not in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if you were cut off from the olive, by nature wild, and were contrary to nature, grafted into the good olive; how much rather shall those who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For, brethren, that you may not be, wise in your own conceits, I would not have you ignorant of this secret, that blindness, in part, has happened to Israel, till the fullness of the Gentiles come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>«And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written,» 'The deliverer shall come out of Zion, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>«For this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>With respect to the gospel, indeed, they are enemies, on your account: but with respect to the election, they are beloved on account of the fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the free gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Besides, as you, in times past, have disobeyed God, yet now have obtained mercy through their disobedience;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>even so these, also, have no disobeyed, that through your mercy, they also may obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has shut up together all for disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Oh that depth of the riches and of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counsellor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For, from him, and by him, and to him, are all things: to him be the glory forever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
