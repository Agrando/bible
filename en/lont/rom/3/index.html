But let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written,» 'That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and mayest overcome when thou judgest.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness display the justice of God, what shall we say? Is not God unjust, who inflicts vengeance? (I speak after the manner of men.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>By no means: otherwise, how shall God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Still, if the truth of God has, through my lie, more abounded to his glory, why am I also yet condemned as a sinner-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and not because we have done evil that good may come, as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we teach-whose condemnation is just?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Do we excel? Not at all. For we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles to be all under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>«As it is written,» 'Surely there is none righteous; no, not one.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is none that understands; there is none that seeks after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They are all gone out of the way: they are together become unprofitable. There is none that does good; there is not so much as one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is an open sepulcher: with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction and misery lurk in their paths;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but the path of peace they have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>«There is no fear of God before their eyes.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that whatever things the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and that all the world may be liable to punishment before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore, by works of law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight; because through law is the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now, a justification which is of God, without law, is exhibited, attested by the law and the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>even a justification which is of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, for all, and upon all, who believe; for there is no difference.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all, having sinned and come short of the glory of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>are justified freely by his favor, through the redemption which is by Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God has set forth a propitiatory, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his own justice, in passing by the sins which were before committed, through the forbearance of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for a demonstration, also, of his justice in the present time, in order that he may be just, when justifying him, who is of the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We conclude, then, that by faith man is justified, without works of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is he the God of the Jews only, and not of the Gentiles, also? Yes, of the Gentiles, also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Seeing there is one God, he will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we, then, make law useless through the faith? By no means: but we establish law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
