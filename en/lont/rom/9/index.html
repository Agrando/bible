Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, it is not to be supposed that the promise of God has failed; for all the descendants of Israel are not Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>«Neither are they all children because they are the seed of Abraham; but» 'In Isaac shall your seed be called.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, the children of the flesh are not the children of God; but the children of the promise are counted for seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>«For the word of promise was this,» 'According to this time, I will come, and Sarah shall have a son.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only this, but Rebecca, also, having conceived twins, by one, even Isaac our father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(they, indeed, not being yet born; neither having done any good or evil; that the purpose of God might stand, by an election; not on account of works, but of him who calls:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>«it was said to her,'The elder shall serve the younger';»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>«as it is written,» 'Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have slighted.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we, then, say? Is there not injustice with God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>«By no means. For he says to Moses,» 'I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy; and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So, then, it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs; but of God, who shows mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>«Besides, the scripture says to Pharaoh,» 'Even for this same purpose I have roused you up; that I might show, in you, my power; and that my name might be published through all the earth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Well, then, he has mercy on whom he will; and whom he will, he hardens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But you will say to me, Why does he still find fault, for who has resisted his will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nay, but, O man, who are you, who reply against God? Shall the thing formed, say to him who formed it, Why have you made me thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Has not the potter a just power over the clay, to make of the same lump one vessel to honor, and another to dishonor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yet God, willing to show his wrath, and make know his power, did bear, with much long-suffering, the vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And that he might make known the riches of his glory, on the vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>even us, whom he has called; not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>«Even as he says, by Hosea,» 'They shall be called my people, who were not my people; and she beloved, who was not beloved.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>«And it shall come to pass, in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people; there they shall be called, Sons of the living God.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>«Besides, Isaiah cries, concerning Israel,» 'Through the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant shall be saved.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>«For he was about to complete and hasten his work in righteousness; for a short work will the Lord make upon this land.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>«And, as Isaiah has said before,» 'Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we should have become as Sodom, and been made like to Gomorrah.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we say, then, that the Gentiles, who did not seek after justification, have attained justification, even a justification which is by faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel, who followed a law of justification, have not attained to a law of justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why?
