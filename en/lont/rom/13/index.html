For there is no power but from God; and those that exist are placed under God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Wherefore, he who sets himself in opposition to the power, resists the ordinance of God: and they who resist shall procure punishment to themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Would you, then, not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the ruler is a servant of God for good to you. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; because he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is a servant of God, a revenger to inflict wrath on him who works evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore, it is necessary for you to be subject, not only on account of punishment, but also on account of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this reason, therefore, you pay taxes also to them, because they are public ministers of God, attending continually to this very business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render, therefore, to all their dues; to whom tax is due, tax; to whom custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honor, honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no man anything, unless to love one another. For he who loves another, has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>«For this,'You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not covet'; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this precept, namely,» 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love works no evil to one's neighbor: therefore, love the fulfilling of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Further, knowing the season, that it is now the hour for us to awake out of sleep. (For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the night is far advanced, and the day is at hand.) Let us, therefore, put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk about decently, as in the day, not in revellings and drunkenness; not in chamberings and lasciviousness; not in strife and envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the lusts of the flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
