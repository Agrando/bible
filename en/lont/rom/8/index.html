But, if any one have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if Christ be in you, the body, indeed, is dead, with respect to sin; but the Spirit is life, with respect to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, if the Spirit of him, who raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he who raised up Christ from the dead, will make even your mortal bodies alive, through his Spirit, who dwells in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Well, then, brethren, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Wherefore, if you live according to the flesh, you shall die; but if, through the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Because, as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you have not received the spirit of bondage, again, to fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also this spirit bears witness, together with our spirit, that we are children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if children, then heirs; heirs, indeed, of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if, indeed, we suffer with him, that with him also we may be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>However, I esteem not the sufferings of the present time, as worthy of comparison with the glory, which is hereafter to be revealed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earnest expectation of the creature, is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creature was subjected to frailty, (not of its own choice, but by him who has subjected it,) in hope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that it may be liberated, from the bondage of a perishing state, and brought into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Besides, we know, that the whole creation sigh together, and travail in anguish till the present time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruit of the Spirit; even we ourselves, groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption; namely, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For even we are saved by hope. Now, hope that is attained, is not hope; for who can hope for that which he enjoys?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for that which we do not enjoy, then, with patience, we wait for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In like manner, also, the Spirit helps our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for, as we ought; however, the Spirit himself intercedes for us, in sighs, which can not be uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he who searches the hearts, knows the mind of the Spirit; that, according to the will of God, he makes intercession for the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides, we know, that all things work together for good, to them who love God; to them, who are called according to his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For, whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son; that he might be the first born among many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moreover, whom he predestinated, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What shall we say, then, to these things? Since God is for us, who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He, certainly, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how will he not, with him, also, graciously give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who will bring an accusation against the elect of God? Is it God who justifies them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he, who condemns them? It is Christ, who died; or rather, who has risen: who also, is at the right hand of God; and who makes intercession for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>«As it is written,» 'Truly, for thy sake, we are put to death all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nay, in all these things, we do more than overcome, through him who has loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life; neither angels, nor principalities; nor powers; neither things present, nor to come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>neither height, nor depth; nor any created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
