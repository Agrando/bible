By his own master he stands or falls; and he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One, indeed, thinks one day more holy than another: but another thinks every day alike. Let every one be convinced in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who observes the day, observe it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day to the Lord, does not observe it: he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end, Christ both dies and rose, and lives again, that he might rule over both the dead and the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But you, why do you condemn your brother? and you, also, why do you despise your brother? for we shall all be placed before the judgment seat of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>«For it is written,» 'As I live, says the Lord, surely every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Well, then, every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us, therefore, no more judge one another; but let us decide, rather, not to lay an occasion of stumbling before a brother, or a cause of falling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself; yet, to him who accounts anything to be unclean, to that man it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now, if your brother be hurt through your meat, you no longer walk as love requires. Do not destroy him with your meat for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not your good, then, be an evil spoken of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Reign of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness and peace, and joy, in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he who, by these things, serves Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Well, then, let us strive after peace, and mutual edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not, for the sake of meat, destroy the work of God. All meats, indeed, are clean; but that meat is hurtful to the man who eats to occasion stumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything by which your brother is made to stumble, or to fall, or is weakened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You have faith: keep it to yourself, in the sight of God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he who discerns a difference, between meats is condemned, if he eat; because he eats not from faith: for what is not from faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
