being, indeed, by interpretation, first, king of righteousness, and next, also, king of Salem; which, by interpretation, is king of peace-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>was without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginnings of days, nor end of life: but, being made like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now, consider how great this priest was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For they, indeed, of the sons of Levi, who received the priesthood, have a commandment to tithe people according to the law; that is, their brethren, although they have come forth from the loins of Abraham:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but he, who did not derive his pedigree from their progenitors, tithed Abraham, and blessed the holder of the promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, beyond all contradiction, the less is blessed by the greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Besides, here, indeed, men, who die, take tithes; but there one, of whom it is testified that he lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, as one may say, even Levi, who receives tithes, was tithed in Abraham:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover, if, indeed, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood, (for with it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should arise, according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore, the priesthood being changed, there is, of necessity, a change also of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he to whom these things are said, was of a different tribe, of which no one gave attendance at the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is very plain that our Lord had sprung from Judah, in relation to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover, it is still more plain that, according to the similitude of Melchisedec,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>another priest arises, who is made, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>«For he testifies,» 'Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Here then, there is a disannulling of the preceding commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(for the law made no one perfect) -and the superinduction of a better hope, by which we draw near to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover, inasmuch as not without an oath-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>«(for they, indeed, were make priests without an oath, but he, with an oath, by him who said to him,'The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec,')»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>by so much was Jesus made the surety of a better institution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Besides, many, indeed, are made priests, because by death they are hindered from continuing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but he, because he lives for ever, has a priesthood which does not pass from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hence, also, he is for able to save them who come to God through him; always living to make intercession for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now such a High Priest became us; who, being holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>has not, like the high priests, need, from time to time, to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people; for this latter he did once, when he offered himself up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the law constitutes men high priests, who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, constituted the Son, who is perfected for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
