For he who comes to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them who diligently seek him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith, Noah, when he received a revelation concerning things not yet seen, being seized with religious fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of his family; by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith, Abraham, when called to go out into a place which he should afterward receive as an inheritance, obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he was going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith, he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the joint heirs of the same promise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he expected the city having foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith, also, Sarah herself received strength for the conception of seed, and brought forth, when past the time of life; because she judged him faithful who had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, therefore, there sprang from one who was dead, in this respect, a race, as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the sand, which is on the sea-shore, innumerable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All these died in faith, not having received the promises. For, seeing the things promised, afar off, and embracing them, they confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now they who speak such things, plainly declare that they earnestly seek a country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For truly, if they had remembered that from which they came out, they might have had an opportunity to return it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, indeed, they strongly desired a better country; that is, a heavenly. Therefore, God is not ashamed of them-to be called their God; because he has prepared for them a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith, Abraham, when tried, offered up Isaac; he who had received the promises offered up his only begotten,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>«concerning whom it was said, that'In Isaac shall thy seed be called';»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>reasoning that God was able to raise him even from the dead; from whence, indeed, he received him in a figure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, with respect to things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith, Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, bowing on the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith, Joseph, when dying, made mention concerning the departing of the children of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith, Moses, when born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and were not afraid of the king's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith, Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>choosing rather to suffer evil with the people of God, than to have the temporary fruition of sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he looked forward to the retribution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith, he left Egypt, not being afraid of the wrath of the king. For he courageously persevered, as perceiving the invisible God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith, he appointed the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood; that he who destroyed the first-born, might not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith, they passed through the Red Sea, as by dry land, which the Egyptians attempting to do, were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, having been encompassed seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith, Rahab, the harlot, was not destroyed with the unbelievers, having received the spies in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what shall I say more? for the time would fail me, to speak of Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jepthah, and David, also, and Samuel, and the prophets-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who, through faith, subdued kingdom, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>quenched the strength of fire, escaped the edges of the sword, grew strong from sickness, became valiant in battle, overturned the camps of the aliens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received their dead by a resurrection, and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And others had trial of mockings and scourgings; and, moreover of bonds and imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they died by the slaughter of the sword, they went about in sheep skins, and in goat skins, being destitute, afflicted, maltreated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>of these the world was not worthy: they wandered in deserts, and mountains, and in caves, and holes of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now, all these, though commanded on account of faith, did not receive the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God having provided something better for us, that they, without us, should not be made perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
