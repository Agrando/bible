For what son is there whom his father does not chastise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if you be without chastisement, of which all sons are partakers, certainly you are bastards, and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Farther, we have had fathers of our flesh, who chastised us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of our spirits, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they, indeed, during a very few days, chastised us according to their pleasure; but he, for our advantage, that we might be partakers of his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, no chastisement, indeed, for the present, seems to be matter of joy, but of sorrow. Nevertheless, afterward it returns the peaceful fruit of righteousness to them who are trained by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore, bring to their right position, the arms that hang down, and the weakened knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And make smooth paths for your feet, that that which is lame, may not be put out of joint, but that it may rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pursue peace with all men, and holiness, without which, no one shall see the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>carefully observing, lest any one come short of the favor of God; lest some bitter root springing up, trouble you, and by it many be polluted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau; who, for one meal, gave away his birthrights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you know, that although afterward he wished to inherit the blessing, he was reprobated: for he found no scope for effecting a change, though he earnestly sought it with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now you are not come to a tangible mountain, which burned with fire; and to blackness, and to darkness, and to tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and to the sound of a trumpet, and to the voice of words, the hearers of which earnestly entreated that a word more might not be addressed to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>«for they could not bear this threat,» 'Even if a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>«And so terrible was the appearance, that Moses said,» 'I exceedingly fear and tremble.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you are come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the general assembly and congregation of the first-born, who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus the mediator of the new institution, and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things than that of Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Take care that you refuse not him who speaks: for if they did not escape, who refused him who spoke on earth, much more we shall not escape, who turn away from him that speaks from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>«whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying,» 'Yet once I shake not the earth only, but also the heavens.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>«Now this speech,» 'YET ONCE,' 'signifies the removing of the things shaken, as of things which were constituted, that the things not shaken may remain.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherefore, we having received a kingdom not shaken, let us have gratitude, by which we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and religious fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For truly our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
