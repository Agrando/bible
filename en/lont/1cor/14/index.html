Therefore, you will be speaking to the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are, perhaps, so many kinds of languages in the world, and none of them is without signification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yet, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be to him who speaks, a foreigner; and he who speaks, will be a foreigner to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore, you, also, since you are earnestly desirous of spiritual gifts, seek them, that you may abound for the edification of the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For which cause, let him who prays in a foreign language, pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a foreign language, my spirit prays; but my understanding is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What, then, is to be done? I will pray with the Spirit, but I will pray also with understanding: I will sing with the Spirit; but I will sing also with understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Else, when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he who fills up the place of the unlearned, say the Amen to your thanksgiving, since he knows not what you say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you, indeed, give thanks well; but the other is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I give thanks to God, speaking in more foreign languages than all of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>yet, in the congregation, I would rather speak five sentences with my meaning understood, that I may instruct others, also, than ten thousand sentences in a foreign language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren, be not children in understanding; but in evil be children, and in understanding be full grown men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>«In the law it is written,» 'Surely, with other tongues, and with other lips, I will speak to this people; yet not even then will they hearken to me, says the Lord.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that foreign languages are for a sign; not to believers, but to unbelievers: but prophecy is for a sign; not to unbelievers, but to believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If, then, the whole congregation be come together in one place, and all speak in foreign languages; and there come in unlearned persons, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and there come in an unbeliever, or an unlearned person, he is corrected by all, he is examined by all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the hidden things of his heart are made manifest: and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, publishing that God is actually among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What is it, then, brethren? When you are come together, each of you has a psalm, has a discourse, has a foreign language, has a revelation, has an interpretation! Let all things be done to edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if any one speak in a foreign language, let it be by two, or at most by three sentences, and separately; and let one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in the congregation; yet let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now, let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But, if to another, sitting by, anything be revealed, let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you all can prophesy, one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Besides, God is not the author of confusion, but of peace. As in all the assemblies of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>let your women be silent in the congregations: for it has not been permitted to them to speak, but they must be in subjection; as the law also commands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands, at home: for it is an indecent thing for women to speak in the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What! went the word of God forth from you? or did it come to you only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any one be really a prophet, or spiritual person, let him acknowledge the things I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if any one be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Wherefore, brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy; and hinder not to speak in foreign languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
