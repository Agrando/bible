Now when it says that all things are subjected, it is manifest that he is excepted, who has subjected all things to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now, when all things are subjected to him, then even the Son himself shall be subjected to him, who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, what shall they do, who are immersed for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why then are they immersed for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why do we endanger ourselves every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I solemnly declare, by your rejoicing, what I also have in Christ Jesus our Lord, that every day I die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If, after the manner of men, I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what is the advantage to me, if the dead rise not? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Awake up as you ought, and sin not; for some of you have not the knowledge of God. For shame to you, I say it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will say, How can the dead be raised up? and with what kind of body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simpleton! what you sow is not made alive, except it die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as to what you sow, you do not show the body which shall be produced, but the naked grain; it may be of wheat, or of any other kind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but God gives it a body, as it has pleased him; and to each of the seeds, its proper body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is, indeed, one flesh of men, and another of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of fowls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there are bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but different, indeed, is the glory of the celestial, and that of the terrestrial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The glory of the sun is one, and the glory of the moon is another, and the glory of the stars another; moreover, star excels star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Just so is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption-it is raised in incorruption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>it is sown in dishonor-it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness-it is raised in power:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>it is sown an animal body-it is raised a spiritual body. There is an animal body, and there is a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>«For thus it is written,» 'The first man, Adam, was made a living soul-the last Adam, a vivifying spirit.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>However, that was not first, which is spiritual; but that which is animal, and then that which is spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man, from the earth, was earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As was the earthy, so also are the earthy; and as is the heavenly, such also shall be heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For, as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And this I affirm, brethren, that flesh and blood can not inherit the kingdom of God; neither can corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I tell you a secret: we shall not, indeed, all die; but we shall all be changed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for it shall sound, and then the dead shall be raised incorruptible; and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible body, must put on incorruption; and this mortal body must put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>«Now, when this corruptible body shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal body shall have put on immortality, then that saying of scripture shall be accomplished,» 'Death is swallowed up forever.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Death! where is thy sting? Hades! where is thy victory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be stable, unmoved; abounding in the work of the Lord at all times, knowing that your labor is not vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
