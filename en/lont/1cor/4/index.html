However, I am not by this justified; but he who judges me is the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore, do not, before the time, pass any judgment, till the Lord come; who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and lay open the counsels of the hearts; and then praise shall be to every one from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself, and Apollos, for your sakes, that by us you may learn not to esteem teachers above what has been written, that no one of you may, on account of one teacher, be puffed up against another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Besides, who makes you to differ? For what have you which you did not receive? And now, if you did receive it, why do you boast as not receiving it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now you are filled! now you are become rich! you have reigned without it! and I wish, indeed, you had reigned, that we also might reign with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I think that God has set forth us, the Apostles, last, as persons appointed to death; because we are made a spectacle to the world, even to angels, and to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are fools on account of Christ; but you are wise in Christ: we are weak, but you are strong: you are honored, but we are despised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and labor, working with our own hands: when reviled, we bless: when persecuted, we bear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>when defamed, we beseech: when we are become as the purgations of the world, the filth of all things until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I write not these things to shame you; but, as my beloved children, I instruct you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, though you have ten thousand teachers in Christ, yet you have not many fathers; for, to Christ Jesus, through the gospel, I have begotten you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wherefore, I beseech you, be imitators of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this purpose I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord: he will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere, in every congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now, some are puffed up, as if I were not coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord will, and shall know, not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Reign of God is not in word, but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What do you incline? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
