And if the world is to be judged by you, are you unworthy to decide your petty causes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we are to judge messengers? Why not, then, things pertaining to this life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If, then, you have the cognizance of such matters, why do you set those to judge who are of no account in the congregation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For shame to you I say it! So, then, there is not among you a wise man; not even one, who shall be able to decide between his brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother with brother is judged, and that by infidels!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, therefore, indeed, there is plainly a fault in you, that you have law-suits with one another. Why do you not rather bear the being defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you injure and defraud; and that, too, your own brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor catamites, nor sodomites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor misers, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you; but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified, by the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All meats are lawful for me to eat, but all are not proper: all meats are lawful for me to eat; but I will not be enslaved by any meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; however, God will destroy both it and them. Now, the body was not made for uncleanness, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and God has both raised the Lord, and will raise up us by his own power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall, I, then, take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? By no means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>«What! do you not know that he who is strongly attached to a harlot is one body? for he says,» 'The two shall be one flesh.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he, who is strongly attached to the Lord, is one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee uncleanness. Every sin which a man commits, is without the body: but he who commits uncleanness, sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What! do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Besides, you are not your own; for you are bought with a price: therefore, with your body glorify God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
