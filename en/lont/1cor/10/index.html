The loaf, which we break; is it not the joint participation of the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because there is one loaf, we, the many, are one body: for we all participate of that one loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look at Israel after the flesh. Are not they, who eat of the sacrifices, joint partakers of the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What, then, do I affirm? that an idol is anything, or than an idol sacrifice is anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No. But, that what the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. Now, I would not have you become joint partakers with the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You can not drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons: you can not partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things are lawful, but all are not expedient; all are lawful, but all do not edify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no one seek his own, but that of his neighbor, also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whatever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question on account of conscience;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>«for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if any of the unbelievers invite you, and you incline to go, whatever is set before you, eat; asking no question on account of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if any one say to you, This is a thing sacrificed to an idol; do not eat, on account of him who showed it, and of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now, I say conscience, not your own, but that of the other. But why is my liberty judged by another's conscience?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if, by favor, I be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whether, then, you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Be no occasion of stumbling; neither to the Jews, nor to the Greeks, nor to the congregation of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Even as I please all men in all things; not seeking my own advantage, but that of the many, that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
