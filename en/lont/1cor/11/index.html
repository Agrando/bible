Besides, it is one and the same, with being shaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Wherefore, if a woman be not veiled, even let her be shorn: but, if it be shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be veiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, man, indeed, ought not to cover the head, being the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Besides the man is not of the woman; but the woman is of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, also, the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this reason, ought the woman to have a vail on her head, on account of the messengers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>However, neither is the man, without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Besides, as the woman is from the man, so also, the man is by the woman; but all from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge in yourselves, is it decent that a woman pray to God unveiled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does not even nature itself teach you that if, indeed, a man have long hair, it is a disgrace to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given to her for a vail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>However, if any one resolve to be contentious, we have no such custom; neither the congregations of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, in declaring this, that you come together, not for the better, but for the worse, I do not praise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, first, indeed, I hear, that when you come together in the congregation, there are schisms among you; and I partly believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must even be sects among you, that the approved among you may be made manifest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But your coming together into one place, is not to eat the Lord's supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For, in eating it, every one takes first his own supper; and one, indeed, is hungry, and another is filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What! have you not houses, to eat and to drink in? or, do you despise the congregation of God and put to shame those who have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this, I praise you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord what, also, I delivered to you; that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which we was betrayed, took a loaf;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and, having given thanks, he broke it; and said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you: do this in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner, also, the cup, after he had supped; saying, This cup is the new institution in my blood: do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this loaf, and drink this cup, you openly publish the death of the Lord, until he come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So, then, whosoever shall eat this loaf, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man examine himself, and then let him eat of the loaf, and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he who eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the body of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause, many among you are weak and sick, and a considerable number are fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet, when we are judged by the Lord, we are corrected, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if any one hunger, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment. And the other things I will set in order when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
