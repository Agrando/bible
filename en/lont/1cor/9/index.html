Am I not a freeman? Have I not seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If to others I am not an Apostle, yet, to you, at least, I am; for the seal of my apostleship, are you, in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My answer to them who condemn me, is this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have we not liberty to eat, and to drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Have we not liberty to lead about a sister wife, as the other Apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or, have I, only, and Barnabas, not liberty to forbear working?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who, at any time, serves in the wars, on his own charges? Who plants a vineyard, and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who feeds a flock, and does not eat of the milk of the flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do I speak these things as a man? Or does not the law also say these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>«For, in the law of Moses it is written,» 'You shall not muzzle the ox treading out the corn.' 'Does God take care of the oxen?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or, does he command this chiefly for our sakes? For our sakes, certainly, it is written: because, he who plows, ought to plough in hope; and he who threshes in hope, ought to partake of his own hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we have sown for you spiritual things, is it a great matter, if we shall reap your carnal things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others partake of this authority over you, ought not we, rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power; but we bear all things, that we may not give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do you not know that they who perform sacred offices, eat from the temple? Do not they who wait at the altar share with the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So also, the Lord has appointed them who announce the gospel, to live by the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have used none of these privileges; neither have I written these things that it should be done to me: for it were good for me rather to die, than that any one should make my boasting void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For when I declared the gospel, I have nothing to boast of; because necessity is laud upon me: yes, woe awaits me if I declare not the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now, if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but, if against my will, still I am entrusted with the stewardship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What, then, is my reward? that, when declaring the gospel, I shall exhibit the gospel of Christ without charge, in order that I may not abuse my power in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, though I be a freeman, with respect to all; I have made myself a servant to all, that I might gain the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So, to the Jews, I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to those under the law, (though not under the law) as under the law, that I might gain those under the law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to those without law, as without law, (not being without law to God, but under law to Christ,) that I might gain those that are without law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To the weak, I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. To all, I have become all things, that, by all means, I might same some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, this I do for the sake of the gospel, and that I may become a joint partaker of its rewards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do you not know that they who run a race, all run, but one only receives the prize? So run, that you may lay hold of the prize?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, every one who contends is temperate in all things: they, indeed, that they may receive a fading crown; but we, one that does not fade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I, therefore, so run, as not out of view. So I fight, not as beating the air:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but, I mortify my body, and keep it in subjection; lest, perhaps, having proclaimed to others, I myself should not be accepted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
