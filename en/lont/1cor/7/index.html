However, each has a proper gift from God; one, indeed, after this manner, and another after that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say, to the unmarried men, and to the widows, it is good for them if they can remain even as I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yet, if they can not live continently, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to be in pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now, those who have married I charge, (yet not I, but the Lord;) let not a wife depart from her husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>but if she even depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and a husband must not put away his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the rest I command, not the Lord; if any brother have an infidel wife, who herself is well pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a woman who has an infidel husband, who himself is well pleased to dwell with her, let her not put him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the infidel husband is sanctified by the wife, and the infidel wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise, certainly, your children were unclean; whereas, indeed, they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the infidel depart, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not in bondage with such; but God has called us to peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how do you know, O wife! whether you shall save your husband? And how do you know, O husband! whether you shall save your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as God has distributed to every one, and as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk; and so, in all the congregations, I ordain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Has any circumcised one been called? Let him not be uncircumcised. Has any one been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let every one remain in the same calling in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Were you called, being a bondman? Be not careful to be made free. Yet, if you can be made free, prefer it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a bondman, who is called by the Lord, is the Lord's freedman. In like manner, also, a freedman who is called, is Christ's bondman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You were bought with a price: become not the slaves of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brethren, in what state each one was called, in that let him remain with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, concerning virgins, I have not a commandment of the Lord: but, I give my judgment, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I declare this, then, to be good, on account of the present distress; namely, that it is good for a man who is unmarried, to continue so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Are you bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And yet, if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned: nevertheless, affliction in the flesh such shall have; but I spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now, this I say, brethren, the time being short, it remains that both they who have wives, should be as not having wives;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and they who weep, as not weeping; and they who rejoice, as not rejoicing; and they who buy, as not possessing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and they who use this world, as not abusing it: for the form of this world passes by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Besides, I would have you without anxious care. The unmarried man anxiously cares for the things of the Lord; how he shall please the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he who is married, anxiously cares for the things of the world; how he shall please his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There is the like difference between the wife and the virgin. The unmarried woman anxiously cares for the things of the Lord; that she may be holy, both in body and spirit: but she who is married, anxiously cares for the things of the world; how she shall please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now, this I say, for your own benefit; not with a view to lay a snare for you, but for that which is becoming, and best adapted to a steady, uninterrupted adherence to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if any one thinks he acts improperly toward his virgin, if she be above age, unmarried, and so needs to be married; let him do what she inclines, he does not sin: let such marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he who stands firm in his heart; not having necessity, and has power concerning his own will; and has determined this in his own heart, to keep his virgin, does well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So, then, even he who gives her in marriage, does well; but he who gives her not in marriage, does better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A wife is bound, as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she pleases; only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier if she continue as she is. This is my opinion; and I think I have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
