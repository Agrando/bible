If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, now, God has placed the members, every one of them, in the body, as he has pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Besides, if all were one member, where were the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now, indeed, there are many members, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, the eye can not say to the hand, I have no need of you: nor, again, the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nay, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble, are necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And those which we think are less honorable members of the body, around them we throw more abundant honor; and so our uncomely members have more abundant comeliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But, our comely members have no need. However, God has tempered the body together; having given to the member which wants it, more abundant honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That there may be no schism in the body; but, that the members may have the very same anxious care, one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So, whether one member suffer, all the members sympathize; or, one member be honored, all the members rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now, you are Christ's body, and members in particular.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And these, indeed, God has placed in the congregation: first, Apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; next, powers; then, gifts of healing; helpers, directors, kinds of foreign languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all Apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? have all powers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>have all the gift of healing? do all speak in foreign languages? do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now, ardently desire the best gifts; and yet I show you a more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
