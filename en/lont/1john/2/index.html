Yet if any one has sinned, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Just One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he is a propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And by this, we know that we have known him, if we keep his commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He who says, I have known him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But whoever keeps his word, truly in this man the love of God is perfected. By this we know that we are in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who says he abides in him, ought, himself, also, so to walk even as he walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Brethren, I do not write a new commandment to you; but an old commandment, which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word, which you have heard from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On the other hand, I write to you a new commandment, which is true concerning him and concerning you. For the darkness is passing away, and the light, which is true, now shines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who says he is in the light and yet hates his brother, is in the darkness till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loves his brother, abides in the light, and there is no stumbling block to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he who hates his brother, is in the darkness, and walks in that darkness, and does not know whither he goes; because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Little children, I write to you, because your sins are forgiven you, on account of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Fathers, I write to you, because you have known him from the beginning. Young men, I write to you, because you have overcome the wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Fathers, I have written to you, because you have known him from the beginning. Young men, I have written to you, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Love not the world, neither the things which are in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life-is not of the Father, but is of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now the world passes away, and the lust of it; be he who does the will of God, abides forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Young children, it is the last period. And as you have heard that the antichrist comes, so, now, there are many antichrists; whence you know that it is the last period.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They went away from us, but they were not of us. For, if they had been of us, they would have abode with us; but they went away, that they might be made manifest that they were not of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But you have an unction from the Holy One, and know all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is a liar, if not he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whoever denies the Son, does not acknowledge the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, let what you have heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you have heard from the beginning, abide in you; you also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and this is the promise which he has promised to us, even eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>These things I have written to you, concerning them who deceive you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but the unction which you have received from him abides in you; and you have no need that any one should teach you, unless the same unction teaches you concerning all things, and is truth, and is no lie: and as it has taught you, you will abide in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and may not be put to shame by him, at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you know that he is righteous, you know that every one who works righteousness, has been begotten by him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
