And this is the victory which overcomes the world, even our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is he that overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is her who came by water and blood, even Jesus the Christ; not by the water only, but by the water and the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it is the Spirit who testified; because the Spirit is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Indeed, there are three who bear testimony: the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. Now, this is the testimony of God, which he has testified concerning his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>(He who believes on the Son of God, has the testimony in himself. He who believes not God, has made him a liar, because he has not believed the testimony, which God has testified concerning his Son.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now this is the testimony, that God has given to us eternal life: and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who has the Son, has this life; he who has not the Son of God, has not this life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things I have written to you, that you may know that you have eternal life-that you may continue to believe on the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence which we have with him, that if we ask anything according to his will, he hearkens to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he hearkens to us, concerning whatever we ask; we know that we shall obtain the petitions which we have asked from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any one see his brother sinning a sin, not to death, let him ask, and he will grant to him life, for those who sin not to death. There is a sin leading to death. I do not say concerning it, that you should ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All unrighteousness is sin: but there is a sin not to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that whoever has been begotten by God, does not sin; but he who is begotten by God, guards himself, and the wicked on does not lay hold on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are of God, and that the whole world lies under the wicked one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover, we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding, that we might know him that is true; and we are in him that is true-in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and the eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Little children, keep yourselves from idols.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
