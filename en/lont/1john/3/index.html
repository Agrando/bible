For this reason, the world does not know us, because it did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beloved, now we are the children of God; but it does not yet appear what we shall be. However, we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him-that we shall see him as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And every one who has this hope in him purifies himself, even as He is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Every one who works sin, works also the transgression of law; for sin is the transgression of law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover, you know that he was manifested that he might take away our sins-and in him is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whoever abides in him, does not sin. Whoever sins has not seen him, neither has known him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Little children, let no one deceive you: he who works righteousness, is righteous, even as He is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who works sin, is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose, the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whoever has been begotten by God, does not work sin; because his seed abides in him; and he can not sin, because he has been begotten by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By this the children of God are discovered, and the children of the devil: whoever works not righteousness, is not of God, neither he who loves not his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message which you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not being of the wicked one, as Cain was, who slew his brother. And on account of what, did he slay him? Because his own works were wicked, and his brother's righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not wonder, my brethren, that the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed away from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who loves not his brother, abides in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Every one who hates his brother, is a manslayer; and you know that no manslayer has eternal life abiding in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By this we have known the love of Christ, because he laid down his life for us; therefore we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Whoever, therefore, has the goods of this world, and sees his brother in need, and yet shuts up his compassion from him, how abides the love of God in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My little children, let us not love in word, nor in tongue; but in deed, and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For by this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if our heart condemn us, certainly God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our heart do not condemn us, we have confidence with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever we ask, we receive from him; because we keep his commandments, and do the things which are pleasing in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For this is his commandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and should love one another as he gave us commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now he who keeps His commandments, abides in him, and He in him; and by this we know that he abides in us, even by the Spirit, which he has given us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
