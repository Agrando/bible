By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another; for love is from God: and every one who loves, has been begotten by God, and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who does not love, does not know God; for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By this the love of God was manifested to us, that God sent forth his Son, the only begotten, into the world, that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent forth his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we, also, ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No one has seen God, at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is made perfect in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By this, we know that we abide in him, and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now we have seen, and bear testimony, that the Father has sent forth his Son, to be the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever will confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we have known, and believed the love which God has in us. God is love; wherefore, he who abides in love, abides in God, and God in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By this, the love has been perfected in us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, so are we in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has torment: therefore, he who fears is not made perfect in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love him, because he first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If any one say, Indeed I love God, and yet hate his brother, he is a liar: for he who loves not his brother, whom he has seen, how can he love God, whom he has not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moreover, this commandment we have from him, that he who loves God, loves his brother, also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
