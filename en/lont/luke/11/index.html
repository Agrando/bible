Wherefore they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I, by the finger of God, expel demons, the Reign of God has overtaken you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When the strong one armed, guards his palace, his effects are secure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if he who is stronger, shall attack and overcome him, he will strip him of his armor, on which he relied, and dispose of his spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who is not for me, is against me; and he who gathers not with me, scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The unclean spirit, when he is gone out of a man, wanders over parched deserts, in search of a resting place. But not finding any, he says, I will return to my house, whence I came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Being come, he finds it swept and embellished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he goes and brings seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and having entered, they dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>While he was saying these things, a woman, raising her voice, cried to him, from amidst the crowd, Happy the womb which bore you! and the breast which suckled you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Say, rather, replied he, Happy they who hear the word of God, and obey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When the people crowded together, he said, This is an evil generation. They demand a sign; but no sign shall be given them, only the sign of Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For, as Jonah was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of Man be to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The queen of the south country will arise in the judgment against the men of this generation, and cause them to be condemned: because she came from the extremities of the earth, to hear the wise discourses of Solomon: and behold, here is something greater than Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment against this generation, and cause it to be condemned: because they reformed when warned by Jonah: and behold, here is something greater than Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>A lamp is lighted, not to be concealed, or put under a vessel, but on a stand; that they who enter may have light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The lamp of the body is the eye: when, therefore, your eye is sound, the whole body is enlightened; but when your eye is distempered, your body is in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Take heed, then, lest the light which is in you, be darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If your whole body, therefore, be enlightened, having no part dark; the whole will be so enlightened, as when a lamp lights you by its flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him. And he went and placed himself at table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the Pharisee was surprised to observe that he used no washing before dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then the Lord said to him, As for you, Pharisees, you cleanse the outside of your cups and dishes, while you yourselves are inwardly full of rapacity and malevolence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Unthinking men! did not he who made the outside, make the inside also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Only give in alms what you have, and all things shall be clean to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Alas, for you, Pharisees! because you pay the tithe of mint and rue, and of every kind of herb, and neglect justice and the love of God. These things you ought to have practiced, and not to have omitted those.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Alas, for you, Pharisees! because you love the most conspicuous seats in synagogues, and salutations in public places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Alas, for you! because you are like concealed graves, over which people walk without knowing it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Here, one of the lawyers interposing, said, By speaking thus, Rabbi, you reproach us also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He answered, Alas, for you, lawyers! also; because you lade men with intolerable burdens-burdens which you yourselves will not so much as touch with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Alas, for you! because you build the monuments of the prophets, whom your fathers killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Surely you are both vouchers and accessories to the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them, and you build their monuments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Wherefore, thus says the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and Apostles: some of them they will kill, others they will banish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>so that the blood of all the prophets, which has been shed since the formation of the world, shall be required of this generation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>from the blood of Abel, to the blood of Zechariah, who fell between the altar and the house of God. Yes, I assure you, all shall be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Alas, for you, lawyers! because you have carried off the key of knowledge; you have not entered yourselves, and those who entering, you hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>While he spoke these things, the Scribes and the Pharisees began vehemently to press him with questions, on many points;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>laying snares for him, in order to draw from his own mouth, matter of accusation against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
