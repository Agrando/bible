And he allotted to them their shares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Soon after, the younger son gathered all together, and traveled into a distant country, and there wasted his substance in riot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When all was spent, a great famine came upon that land, and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he applied to one of the inhabitants of the country, who sent him into his fields to keep swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he desired to appease his hunger with the husks on which the swine were feeding; for no person gave him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At length, coming to himself, he said, How many hirelings has my father, who have all more bread than suffices them, while I perish with hunger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise, and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and am no longer worthy to be called your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose, and went to his father. When he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and threw himself upon his neck, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said, Father, I have sinned against heaven and you, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, Bring here the principal robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger, and shoes on his feet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>bring also the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and be merry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. So they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now his elder son was in the field, walking home. And as he drew near the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He, therefore, called one of the servants, and asked the reason of this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered, Your brother is returned, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him in health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was angry, and would not go in; therefore, his father came out, and entreated him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He answering, said to his father, These many years I have served you, without disobeying your command in anything; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might entertain my friends;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but no sooner did this, your son, return, who had squandered your living on prostitutes, than you killed for him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Son, replied the father, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>it was but reasonable that we should rejoice and be merry; because this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
