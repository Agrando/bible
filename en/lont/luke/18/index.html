Will he linger in their cause?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I assure you, he will suddenly avenge them. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find this belief upon the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then addressing some who were conceited of themselves, as being righteous, and despised others, he proposed this example:-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up to the temple to pray; one a Pharisee, the other a publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee standing by himself, prayed thus: -O God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice a-week. I give tithes of all that I possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the publican, standing at a distance, and not daring so much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, smote his breast, and cried, God, be merciful to me a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I assure you, that this man returned home more approved than the other: for whoever exalts himself, shall be humbled; but whoever humbles himself, shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they presented babes to him, that he might touch them: the disciples observing it, rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus calling them to him, said, Permit the children to come to me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Indeed, I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall never enter it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what good shall I do to obtain eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered, Why do you call me good? God alone is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery; do not commit murder; do not steal; do not give false testimony; honor your father and your mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He replied, All these I have observed from my childhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hearing this, Jesus said to him, Yet in one thing you are deficient: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: then come and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he heard this, he was exceedingly sorrowful; for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus, perceiving that he was very sorrowful, said, How difficult will it be for men of opulence to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>«The hearers said, Who, then, can be saved?»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus answered, Things impossible to men, are possible to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter said, Lo! we have forsaken all, and followed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that there is none who shall have forsaken his house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, on account of the kingdom of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive manifold more in return, in this world, and in the future, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus, taking the twelve aside, said to them, We are now going to Jerusalem, where that all the prophets have written, shall be accomplished on the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and ridicules, and insulted, and spitted on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after scourging, they will kill him; and he shall rise again the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they understood none of these things: this discourse was dark to them; they did not comprehend its meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When he came near to Jericho, a blind man who sat by the way-side begging,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>hearing the crowd pass by, inquired what was the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And being told that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>he immediately cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They who went before, charged him to be silent; but he cried the louder, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus stopped, and commanded them to bring the man to him. And when he was nigh, he asked him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>What do you wish me to do for you? He answered, Master, to give me my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight; your faith has cured you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Instantly he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people saw it, and praised God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
