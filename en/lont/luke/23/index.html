He answered, You say right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitude, I find nothing criminal in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they became more vehement, adding, He raised sedition among the people, by the doctrine which he spread through all Judea, from Galilee, where he began, to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Pilate heard them mention Galilee, he asked, whether the man were a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And finding that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also then at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Herod was very glad to see Jesus: it was what he had long desired; having heard much of him, and hoping to see him perform some miracle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He, therefore, asked him many questions, but Jesus returned him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet the chief priests and the scribes, who were present, accused him with eagerness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Herod and his military train despised him: and having, in derision, arrayed him in a splendid robe, remanded him to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On that day, Pilate and Herod became friends; for, before, they had been at enmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate, having convened the chief priests, the magistrates and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>said to them, You have brought this man before me, as one who excites the people to revolt; yet, having examined him in your presence, I have not found him guilt of any of those crimes of which you accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither has Herod; for I referred you to him. Be assured, then, that he has done nothing to deserve death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it was necessary that he should release one to them at the festival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then all cried out together, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for raising sedition in the city, and for murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pilate, willing to release Jesus, again, expostulated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they cried, saying, Crucify! crucify him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A third time he repeated, Why? What evil has this man done? I do not find him guilty of any capital crime; I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they persisted, demanding, with much clamor, that he might be crucified. At last, their clamors, and those of the chief priests, prevailed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and Pilate pronounced sentence, that it should be as they desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Accordingly, he released a man who had been imprisoned for sedition and murder; whom they required; and gave up Jesus to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him, that he might bear it after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a great multitude followed him, amongst whom were many women, who lamented and bewailed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for the days are coming, in which they shall say, Happy the barren, the wombs which never bare, and the breasts which never gave suck!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they shall cry to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for if it fare thus with the green tree, how shall it fare with the dry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And two malefactors were also led with him to execution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they came to the place called Calvary, they there nailed him to a cross, and the malefactors also; one at his right hand, the other at his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they parted his garments by lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While the people stood gazing, even their rulers joined them in ridiculing him, and saying, This man saved others; let him save himself, if he be the Messiah, the elect of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The soldiers likewise mocked him, coming and offering him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, If you be the King of the Jews, save yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There was also an inscription over his head in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now, one of the malefactors who suffered with him, reviled him, saying, If you be the Messiah, save yourself and us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The other, rebuking him, answered, Have you no fear of God, you who are undergoing the same punishment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we, indeed, justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou comest to thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, Today you shall be with me in paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And, about the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the land, which lasted till the ninth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The sun was darkened, and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus said with a loud voice, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit; and having thus said, he expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then, the centurion, observing what had happened, gave glory to God; saying, Assuredly, this was a righteous man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nay, all the people who were present at this spectacle, and saw what had passed, returned, beating their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all his acquaintance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, standing at a distance, beheld these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now, there was a senator, named Joseph, a good and just man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>from Arimathea, a city of Judea, who had not concurred in the resolutions and proceedings of the rest; and who himself, also expected the Reign of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb cut in stone, in which no man had ever been deposited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath approached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the women, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee, followed Joseph, and observed the tomb, and how the body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>When they returned, they provided spices and ointments, and then rested the Sabbath, according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
