Having said this, he cried, Whosoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And his disciples asked him, saying, What does this parable mean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He answered, It is your privilege to know the secrets of the Reign of God, which, to others, are couched in parables; that, though they look, they may not perceive; that though they hear, they may not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, this is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>By the wayside are meant those hearers out of whose hearts the devil coming, takes away the word, these they should believe, and be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By the rock are meant those, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; yet not having it rooted in them, are but temporary believers; for in the time of trial they fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>By the ground encumbered with thorns, are meant those hearers who are entangled in the business, and pursuits, and pleasures of life; which stifle the word, so that it brings no fruit to maturity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But by the good soil are meant those, who, having heard the word, retain it in a good and honest heart, and persevere in bringing forth fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A lamp is never lighted to be covered with a vessel, or put under a bed; but to be set on a stand, that they who enter may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For there is no secret which shall not be discovered; nor anything concealed which shall not be known, and become public.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Take heard, therefore, how you hear; for to him who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then his mother and brothers came to speak with him; but could not get near him for the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it was told him by some persons, Your mother and your brothers are without, desiring to see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he, answering, said to them, My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and obey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>One day, Jesus having gone into a bark with his disciples, said to them, Let us cross the lake. Accordingly they set sail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But while they sailed, he fell asleep; and there blew such a storm upon the lake, as filled the bark with water, and endangered lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they came to him, and awakened him, saying, Master, Master, we perish! Then he arose and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus said to them, Where is your faith? But they said one to another, with fear and admiration, Who is this that commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Being come ashore, a man of the city met him, who had been long possessed by demons; and who wore no clothes, and had no habitation but the sepulchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he saw Jesus, he roared out, and threw himself at his feet, crying, What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you, do not torment me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For he had ordered the unclean spirit to come out of the man; for it had frequently seized him, so that when he was chained and fettered, he broke his bonds, and was driven by the fiend into the desert.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>«Then Jesus asked him, saying, What is your names? He answered, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they entreated him, that he would not command them to go into the deep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but, as there was a numerous herd of swine feeding on the mountain, that he would permit them to enter into the swine. And he permitted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the demons having quitted the man, entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down a precipice into the lake, and were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The herdsmen, seeing this, fled, and spread the news through the city and villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the inhabitants flocked out to see what had happened. Being come to Jesus, and finding the man of whom the demons were dispossessed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind, they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But having been informed by the spectators, in what manner the demoniac delivered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>all the people of the country of the Gadarenes, entreated him to leave them; for they were struck with terror. Accordingly, he re-entered the bark, and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now, the man out of whom the demons were gone, entreated his permission to attend him. But Jesus dismissed him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Return home, and relate what great things God has done for you. Then he departed, and published through all the city, what great things Jesus had done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus, at his return, was welcomed by the crowd, who were all waiting for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Meantime, a man named Jairus, came, a ruler of the synagogue, who, throwing himself at the feet of Jesus, besought him to come into his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. As Jesus went along, the people crowded him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and a woman, who had been twelve years afflicted with an issue of blood, and had consumed all her living upon physicians, none of whom could cure her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>coming behind, touched the tuft of his mantle; upon which her issue was stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then Jesus said, Who touched me? When every body denied it, Peter, and those with him, answered, Master, the multitude throng and press you, and do you say, Who touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jesus replied, Some person has touched me; for I am sensible that my power was just now exerted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the woman perceiving that she was discovered, came trembling, and having thrown herself prostrate, declared to him, before all the people, why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and he said to her, Daughter, take courage, your faith has cured you, go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While he was yet speaking, one came from the house of the director of the synagogue, who said, your daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus, hearing this, said to Jairus, Fear not; only believe, and she shall be well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Being come to the house, he allowed no person to enter with him, except Peter, and John, and James, and the maid's father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all wept, and lamented her. But he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But he, having made them all retire, took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maiden, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately, and he commanded to give her food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And her parents were astonished, but he charged them not to mention to any person what had happened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
