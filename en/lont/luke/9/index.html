And he was desirous to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now, the Apostles having returned, reported to Jesus all that they had done: and he, taking them with him, retired privately to a desert belonging to the city of Bethsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the multitude, having known it, followed him; and he, receiving them, spoke to them concerning the Reign of God; and he healed those who had need of healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the day began to decline, the twelve, accosting him, said, Dismiss the people, that they may go to the nearest towns and villages, and provide themselves lodging and food; for we are in a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He answered, Supply them yourselves with food. They replied, We have only five loaves and two fishes; unless we go and buy victuals for all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they were about five thousand men. Then he said to his disciples, Make them recline in parties; fifty in a party.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they did so, making them all recline.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to his disciples, to set before the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they all did eat and were satisfied; and took up twelve baskets full of fragments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Afterward, Jesus having withdrawn from the multitude to pray, apart with his disciples, asked them, saying, Who do people say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They answered, John the Immerser; others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the ancient prophets is risen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered, The Messiah of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then, having strictly charged them, he prohibited them from telling this to any person;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>adding, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and rise again the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover, he said to all the people, If any man will come under my guidance, let him renounce himself, and take his cross daily, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, with the forfeit or ruin of himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in that of the Father, and of the holy angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I assure you, that there are some standing here, who shall not taste death till they see the Reign of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>About eight days after this discourse, he took with him Peter, and John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>While he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was changed, and his raiment contracted a dazzling whiteness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, behold, two men of a glorious aspect, Moses and Elijah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>conversed with him, and spoke of the departure which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now, Peter, and those that were with him, were overpowered with sleep; but when they awoke, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As these were removing from Jesus, Peter said to him, not knowing what he said, Master, it is good for us to stay here; let us, then, make three booths, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>While he was speaking, a cloud came and covered them, and the disciples feared, when they entered the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>From the cloud a voice came, which said, This is my Son, the beloved; hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone. And they kept secret, telling no person, in those days, anything of what they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And one of the crowd cried out, saying, Rabbi, I beseech you, take pity on my son; for he is my only child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And lo! a spirit seizes him, making him instantly cry out, and fall into convulsions, so that he foams; and after he is much bruised, hardly leaves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I besought your disciples to expel the demon; but they were not able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then, Jesus answering, said, O incredulous and perverse generation! how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring your son hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as he was coming, the demon dashed him down in convulsions. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and having cured the child, delivered him to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they were all amazed at the great power of God. While all were admiring everything which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Mark diligently these words, the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But they understood not this language; it was veiled to them, that they might not apprehend it; and they were afraid to ask him concerning it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And there arose a debate among them, which of them should be the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But Jesus, who perceived the thought of their heart, took a child, and placing him near himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>said to them, Whosoever shall receive this child for my sake, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, receives him who sent me: for he who is the least amongst you all, this person shall be great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then John replied, Master, we saw one expelling demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he consorts not with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered, Forbid not such; for whosoever is not against us, is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Now, as the time of his departure approached, he set out resolutely for Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and sent messengers before, who went into a village of the Samaritans to make preparation for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But they would not admit him; because they perceived he was going to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>His disciples, James and John, observing this, said, Master, shall we call down fire from heaven to consume them, as Elijah did?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he turned and rebuked them, saying, Do you not know of what spirit you are?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And they went to another village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As they were on the way, one said to him, Master, I will follow you whithersoever you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus answered, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have places of shelter; but the Son of Man has not where to repose his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>He said to another, Follow me. He answered, Sir, permit me first to go and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Jesus replied, Let the dead bury their dead; but go you and publish the Reign of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Another, likewise, said, I will follow you, Sir; but first permit me to take leave of my family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus answered, No man, having put his hand to the plow, looks behind him, is fit for the kingdom of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
