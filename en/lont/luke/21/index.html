for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They shall fall by the sword; they shall be carried captive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth, the anguish of desponding nations; and roarings in the seas, and floods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men expiring with the fear and apprehension of those things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they shall see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great glory and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now when these things begin to be fulfilled, look up, and lift up your heads; because your deliverance approaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He proposed to them, also, this comparison: Consider the fig tree, and the other trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When you observe them shooting forth, you know, of yourselves, that the summer is nigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Know, in like manner, when you shall see these events, that the Reign of God is nigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Indeed, I say to you, that this race shall not fail until all be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Heaven and earth shall fail; but my words shall not fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, lest your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and worldly cares, and that day come upon you unawares: for, as a net,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>it shall inclose all the inhabitants of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be vigilant, therefore, praying on every occasion, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these approaching evils, and to stand before the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus Jesus taught in the temple by day, but retired at night to the mountain, called the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And every morning the people resorted early to the temple to hear him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
