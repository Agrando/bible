Render an account of your management, for you shall be steward no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the steward said within himself, What shall I do? My master takes from me the stewardship; I can not dig, and am ashamed to beg.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I am resolved what to do, that when I am discarded, there may be some who will receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Having, therefore, sent severally for all his master's debtors, he asked one, How much do you owe my master?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He answered, A hundred baths of oil. Take back your bill, said the steward, sit down directly, and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he asked another, How much do you owe? He answered, A hundred homers of wheat. Take back your bill, said he, and write eighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The master commended the prudence of the unjust steward; for the children of this world are more prudent in conducting their affairs, than the children of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, I say to you, with the deceitful riches procure to yourself friends, who, after your discharge, may receive you into the eternal mansion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whoso is faithful in little is faithful also in much: and whoso is unjust in little, is unjust also in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If, therefore, you have not been honest in the deceitful, who will entrust you with the true riches?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if you have been unfaithful managers for another, who will give you anything to manage for yourselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A servant can not serve two masters: for either he will hate one, and love the other; or, at least, will attend one, and neglect the other. You can not serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the Pharisees, who loved money, heard all these things, they ridiculed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he said to them, As for you, you make yourselves pass upon men for righteous, but God knows your hearts; for that which is admired of men is abhorred of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You had the law and the prophets till the coming of John, since whose time, the kingdom of God is announced, and every occupant enters it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But sooner shall heaven and earth perish, than one tittle of the law shall fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whoever divorces his wife, and takes another, commits adultery; and whoever marries the divorced woman, commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a certain rich man, that wore purple and fine linen, and feasted splendidly every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There was also a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, that was laid at his gate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and who was desirous to feed on the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It happened that the poor man died, and was conveyed by angels to Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in hades, being in torments, he looked up, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and cried, saying, Have pity on me, father Abraham, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tortured in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Abraham answered, Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received good things, and Lazarus received evil things; but now he is in joy, and you are in torments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Besides, there lies a huge gulf between us and you, so that they who would pass hence to you, can not: neither can they pass to us, who would come thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The other replied, I entreat you, then, father, to send him to my father's house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I have five brothers, that he may admonish them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham answered, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nay, said he, father Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead, they would reform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Abraham replied, if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should arise from the dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
