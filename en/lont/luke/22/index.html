Do this in commemoration of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He likewise gave the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new Institution in my blood, which is shed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Mark, however, that the hand of him who betrays me, is on the table with mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Son of Man is going away, as has been determined: nevertheless, alas, for that man by whom he is betrayed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it could be that would do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There had been, also, a contention amongst them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, The king of the nations exercise dominion over them; and they who oppress them, are styled benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But with you, it must be otherwise: nay, let the greatest amongst you be as the least; and him who governs, as he who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, which is greater, he who is at table, or he who serves? Is not he that is at table? Yet I am amongst you as one who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You are they who have continued with me in my trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I grant to you, (forasmuch as my Father has granted me a kingdom,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>to eat, and to drink at my table, in my kingdom, and to sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Lord said, also, Simon, Simon, Satan has obtained permission to sift you as wheat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not; do you, therefore, when you have recovered yourself, confirm your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He answered, Master, I am ready to accompany you, both to prison, and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus replied, I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow today, before you have thrice denied that you know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and bag, and shoes, did you want anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But now, said he, let him that has a purse, take it, and likewise his bag; and let him who has no sword, sell his mantle, and buy one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>«for I tell you that this scripture,» 'He was ranked among malefactors,' 'is now to be accomplished in me: for the things relating to me must be fulfilled.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They said, Master, here are two swords. He replied, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he went out, and repaired, as he was wont, to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Being arrived there, he said to them, Pray that you may not yield to temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then, being withdrawn from them about a stone's cast; he kneeled down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, Father, if thou wilt, take this cup away from me; nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in an agony of grief, he prayed the more fervently, and his sweat fell like clotted blood to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Having risen from prayer, and returned to the disciples, he found them sleeping, oppressed with grief;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and said to them, Why do you sleep? Arise, and pray, lest the trial overcome you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Before he had done speaking, he saw a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, walked before them, and came up to Jesus, to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now, those who were with him, foreseeing what would happen, said to him, Master, shall we strike with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said, Let this suffice; and touching his ear, he healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and the officers of the temple-guard, and the elders, who were come to apprehend him, Do you come with swords and clubs, as in pursuit of a robber?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>While I was daily with you in the temple, you did not attempt to arrest me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then they seized him, and led him away to the high priest's house. And Peter followed at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and were sitting round it, Peter sat down among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a maid servant, having observed him sitting by the fire, and viewed him attentively, said, This man also was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he disowned him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>A little while after, another seeing him, said, You, also, are one of them. Peter answered, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>About an hour after, another averred the same thing, saying, This man was surely with him, for he is a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Peter answered, Man, I know nothing of this matter. And just as he spoke the word, a cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then the Lord, turning, looked upon Peter, and Peter called to mind the word which the Lord had said to him, Before the cock crow, you will disown me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he went out and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Meantime, they who had Jesus in charge, mocked and beat him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and having blindfolded him, struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Divine who it is that smote you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other abusive things they said against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>As soon as it was day, the national senate, with the chief priests and scribes, were assembled, and having caused him to be brought into their council-chamber, said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>If you be the Messiah, tell us. He answered, If I tell you, you will not believe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if put a question, you will neither answer me, nor acquit me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Hereafter the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of Almighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>They all replied, You are, then, the Son of God? He answered, You say the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Then they cried, What further need have we of evidence? We have heard enough ourselves, from his own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
