Cut it down: why should it cumber the ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He answered, Sir, let it alone one year longer till I dig about it, and manure it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>perhaps it will bear fruit: if not, you may afterward cut it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>On the Sabbath, as he was teaching in a synagogue,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>a woman was present, who, for eighteen years, had a spirit of infirmity, by which she was so bowed down that she could not so much as look up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus, perceiving her, called her to him, and, laying his hand on her, said, Woman, you are delivered from your infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Immediately she stood upright, and glorified God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the director of the synagogue, moved with indignation, because Jesus had performed a cure on the Sabbath, said to the people, There are six days for working; come, therefore, on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To which the Lord replied, Hypocrites! who is there amongst you that does not, on the Sabbath, loose his ox or ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And must not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has kept bound, lo! these eighteen years, be released from this bond on the Sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On his saying this, all his opposers were ashamed; but the whole multitude was delighted with all the glorious actions performed by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, moreover, What does the kingdom of God resemble? To what shall I compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It resembles a grain of mustard seed, which a man threw into his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree, and the birds of the air took shelter in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again, he said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It resembles leaven, which a woman mingled in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he took a journey to Jerusalem; teaching as he passed through cities and villages:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and one asked him, Master, are there but few who shall be saved? He answered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Force your entrance through the straight gate; for many, I assure you, will request to be admitted, who shall not prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If once the master of the house shall have arisen and locked the door, and you standing without and knocking, say, Master, Master, open to us; he will answer, I know not whence you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they will say, We have eat and drunk with you, and you have taught in our streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he will answer, I tell you, I know not whence you are: remove hence, all you workers of unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then will ensue weeping, and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets received into the kingdom of God, and yourselves excluded:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>nay, people will come from the east, from the west, from the north, and from the south, and will place themselves at table in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, behold, they are last, who shall be first; and they are first, who shall be last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The same day, certain Pharisees came to him, and said, Get away; depart hence, for Herod intends to kill you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He answered, Go, tell that fox, Today and to-morrow I expel demons, and perform cures, and the third day my course will be completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless, I must walk about today and to-morrow, and the day following; for it can not be, that a prophet should be cut off anywhere but in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! that killest the prophets, and stonest them whom God sends to you! how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings; but you would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Quickly shall your house be deserted; for indeed, I say to you, you shall not see me, till the time when you shall say, Blessed be He who comes in the name of the Lord!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
