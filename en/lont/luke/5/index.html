And they came, and loaded both their barks, so that they were near sinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the draught of fishes which they had taken had filled him and all his companions with terror,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>particularly James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not, henceforth you shall catch men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And having brought their barks to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he was in one of the neighboring cities, a man covered with leprosy, happened to see him, threw himself on his face, and besought him, saying, Master, if you will, you can cleanse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus stretching out his hand, and touching him, said, I will; be you cleansed. That instant his leprosy departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he commanded him to tell no person. But go, said he, show yourself to the priest, and present the offered appointed by Moses, for notifying the people that you are cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet so much the more was Jesus everywhere talked of, that vast multitudes flocked to hear him, and to be cured by him of their maladies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he withdrew into solitary places, and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One day, as he was teaching, and Pharisees, and doctors of law, who had come from Jerusalem, and from every town of Galilee and Judea, were sitting by, the power of the Lord was exerted in the sure of the sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, behold, some men carrying on a bed a man afflicted with a palsy, endeavored to bring him in, and place him before Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but finding it impracticable, by reason of the crowd, they got upon the roof, and let him down through the tiling, with the little bed, in the midst before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus perceiving their faith, said, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>On which the Scribes and the Pharisees reasoned thus, Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Can any one forgive sins except God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus knowing their thoughts, addressed himself to them, and said, What are you reasoning in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins, Arise, said he to the palsied man, take up your bed, and return to your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That instant he rose in their presence, took up his bed, and returned home, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Seeing this, they were all struck with amazement and reverence, and glorified God, saying, We have seen wonderful things today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After this, he went out, and observing a publican, named Levi, sitting at the toll-office, said to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he arose, left all, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made him a great entertainment in his own house, where there was a great company of publicans and others, at table with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the Scribes and the Pharisees of the place murmured, saying to his disciples, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answering, said to them, It is not the healthy, but the sick, who need a physician.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am come to call, not the righteous, but sinners, to reformation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they asked him, How is it that the disciples of John, and likewise those of the Pharisees, frequently fast and pray, but yours eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He answered, Would you have the bridesmen fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them: in those days they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He added this similitude, No man mends an old mantle with new cloth; otherwise the new will rend the old; besides, the old and new will never suit each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>No person puts new wine into old leather bottles; otherwise, the new wine will burst the bottles, and thus the wine will be spoiled, and the bottles rendered useless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if new wine be put into new bottles, both will be preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Besides, a man, after drinking old wine, calls not immediately for new; for he says, The old is milder.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
