Alas, for thee, Bethsaida! For if the miracles which have been performed in you, had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they had reformed long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore, the condition of Tyre and Sidon shall be more tolerable, in the judgment, than yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou, Capernaum, which has been exalted in heaven, shall be thrown down to hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that hears you, hears me; and he that rejects you, rejects me; and he that rejects me, rejects him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Master, even the demons are subject to us, through your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to them, I beheld Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lo! I empowered you to turn on serpents, and scorpions, and all the might of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless, rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are enrolled in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At that time, Jesus was joyful in spirit, and said, I adore thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth; because, having hid these things from sages, and the learned, thou hast revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, because such is thy pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>My Father has imparted everything to me; and none knows who the Son is, but the Father; nor who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then, turning apart, he said to his disciples: Blessed are the eyes which see what you see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I assure you, that many prophets and kings have wished to see the things which you see; but have not seen them: and to hear the things which you hear; but have not heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then a lawyer stood up, and said, trying him, Rabbi, what must I do to obtain eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to him, What does the law prescribe? What do you read there?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>«He answered,» 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus replied, You have answered right. Do this, and you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, desirous to appear blameless, said to Jesus, Who is my neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said, in return, A man of Jerusalem, traveling to Jericho, fell among robbers; who, having stripped and wounded him, went away, leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>A priest, accidentally going that way, and seeing him, passed by on the father side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Likewise a Levite, on the road, when he came near the place, and saw him, passed by on the farther side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and went up to him; and having poured wine and oil into his wounds, he bound them up. Then he set him on his own beast, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On the morrow, when he was going away, he took out two denarii, and giving them to the host, said, Take care of this man, and whatever you spend more, when I return I will repay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now which of these three, do you think, was neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The lawyer answered, He who took pity upon him. Then said Jesus, Go you and do in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, as he traveled, he went into a village, where a woman named Martha entertained him at her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the feet of Jesus, listening to his discourse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but Martha, who was much cumbered about serving, came to him and said, Master, do you not care that my sister leaves me to serve alone? Bid her, therefore, assist me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus answering, said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious, and trouble yourself about many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>One thing only is necessary. And Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken from her.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
