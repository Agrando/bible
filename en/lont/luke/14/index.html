One said, I have purchased a field, which I must go and see; I pray you have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, which I am going to prove; I pray you have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A third said, I have married a wife; and, therefore, I can not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The servant being returned, related all to his master. Then the master of the house was angry, and said to his servants, Go immediately into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Afterward, the servant said, Sir, your orders are executed, and still there is room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The master answered, Go out into the highways, and along the hedges, and compel people to come, that my house may be filled:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for I declare to you, that none of those who were invited, shall taste of my supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As great multitudes traveled along with him, he turned to them, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters; nay, and himself, too; he can not be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whosoever does not follow me, carrying his cross, can not be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first, by himself, compute the expense, to know whether he have the means to complete it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>lest, having laid the foundation, and being unable to finish, he become the derision of all who see it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who will say, This man began to build, but was not able to finish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king, going to engage another king, with whom he is at war, does not first consult, by himself, whether he can, with ten thousand men, encounter him who comes against him with twenty thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that if he can not, he may, while the other is at a distance, send an embassy to sue for peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So then, whosoever he be of you, who does not renounce all that he has, he can not be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Salt is good; but if the salt become insipid, with what shall it be seasoned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is fit neither for the land, nor for the dunghill, but is thrown away. Whosoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
