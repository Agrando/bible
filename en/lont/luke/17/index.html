I suppose not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In like manner say you, when you have done all that is commanded of you, We, your servants, have conferred no favor; we have done only what we were bound to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, in traveling to Jerusalem, he pass through the confines of Samaria and Galilee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and being about to enter a certain village, there met him ten lepers, who stood at a distance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cried out, Jesus, Master, take pity upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he saw them, he said to them, Go, show yourselves to the priests. And as they went, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, perceiving that he was healed, turned back, glorifying God aloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then throwing himself prostrate at the feet of Jesus, he returned him thanks. Now this man was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said, Were not ten cleansed? Where are the other nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Have none returned glory to God except this alien?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Arise, go your way; your faith has cured you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Being questioned by the Pharisees, when the Reign of God should commence, he answered, The Reign of God is not ushered in with parade;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor shall people say, Lo, here! or Lo, yonder! for behold, the Reign of God is within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he said to his disciples, The time will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and shall not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when they say to you, Lo, here! or Lo, yonder! go not out to follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightning flashes in an instant from one extremity of the sky to the other, so will the appearance of the Son of Man be, in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer much, and be rejected of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And, as it happened in Noah's days, it will also happen in the days of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They eat, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, when the deluge came, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In like manner as it was in the days of Lot, they eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but on the day that Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, which destroyed them all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>so it will be on the day when the Son of Man shall appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>On that day, let not him who shall be on the house-top, having his furniture in the house, come down to take it away. Let not him who shall be in the field, return home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life, shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you, there will be two men, that night, in one bed; one will be seized, and the other will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two women will be grinding together; one will be seized, and the other will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>OMITTED TEXT</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then they asked him, Where, Master? He answered, Where the body is, the eagles will be assembled.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
