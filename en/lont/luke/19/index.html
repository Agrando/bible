Did you know that I am a hard master, exacting what I did not give, and reaping what I did not sow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Why, then, did you not put my money into the bank; that at my return I might have received it with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he said to his attendants, Take the pound from him, and give it to him who has ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They answered, My Lord, he has ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He replied, I tell you, that to every one who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But as for those my enemies, who would not have me for their king, bring them hither, and slay them in my presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this discourse, Jesus walked foremost, traveling toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mountain called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, Go to yonder village, where, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever rode; loose him, and bring him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If any one ask you why you loose him, you shall answer, Because the Master needs him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Accordingly, they who received this order, went, and found everything as he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As they were loosing the colt, the owners said to them, Why loose you the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered, The Master needs him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they brought him to Jesus, and having thrown their mantles upon the colt, set Jesus on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As he went, the people spread their mantles in the way before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When he was so near as the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God in loud acclamations, for all the miracles which they had seen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying, Blessed be the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Upon this, some Pharisees in the crowd said to him, Rabbi, rebuke your disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He answered, I tell you, that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When he came near, and beheld the city, he wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, O that thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, the things which concern thy peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for the days are coming upon thee, when thine enemies will surround thee with a rampart, and inclose thee, and shut thee up on every side;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and will level thee with the ground, thee and thy children, and will not leave one stone upon another, because thou didst not know the time when thou wast visited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Afterward he went into the temple, and drove out thence those who sold, and those who bought in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>«saying to them, It is written,'My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he taught daily in the temple, while the chief priests and the scribes, and persons of principal note, sought his destruction;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>but could not devise how to effect it: for all the people heard him with the greatest attention.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
