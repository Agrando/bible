A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But what did you go out to see? A man effeminately dressed? It is in royal palaces that they who wear splendid apparel, and live in luxury, are found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What then did you go to see? a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and something superior to a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>«For this is he, concerning whom it is written,'Behold, I send my messenger before you, who shall prepare your way.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I declare to you, among those who are born of women, there is not a greater prophet than John the Immerser; yet, the least in the Reign of God is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>All the people, even the publicans, who heard John, have, by receiving immersion from him, honored God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>whereas, the Pharisees and the lawyers, in not being immersed by him, have rejected the counsel of God with regard to themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>To what shall I compare the men of this generation? Whom are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children in the market place, of whom their companions complain, and say, We have played to you upon the pipe, but you have not danced; we have sung mournful songs to you, but you have not wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the Immerser is come, abstaining from bread and wine, an associate of publicans and sinners; and you say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of Man is come, using both; and you say, He is a lover of banquets, and wine, an associate of publicans and sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But wisdom is justified by all her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him: and he went into the Pharisee's house, and placed himself at table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And behold, a woman of the city who was a sinner, knowing that he eat at the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of balsam,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and standing behind at his feet weeping, bathed them with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the balsam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The Pharisee, who had invited him, observing this, said within himself, If this man were a prophet, he would have known who this woman is that touches him, and of what character, for she is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. He answered, Say it, Rabbi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, the other fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But not having the means to pay, he freely forgave them both. Say, then, which of them will love him most?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answered, I suppose he whom he forgave most? Jesus replied, You have judged right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then turning to the woman, he said, Simon, Do you see this woman? When I came to your house, you gave me no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You gave me no kiss; but she, since she entered, has not ceased kissing my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>You did not anoint my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with balsam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Wherefore, I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; therefore, her love is great. But he to whom little is forgiven, has little love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Those, who were at table with him, said within themselves, Who is this, that even forgives sins?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
