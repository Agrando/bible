I bring you good tidings, which shall prove matter of great joy to all the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because today is born to you in the city of David, a Saviour, who is the Lord Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by this you shall know him; you shall find a babe in swaddling bands, lying in a manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Instantly the angel was attended by a multitude of the heavenly host, who praised God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace, and good will amongst men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the angels returned to heaven, having left the shepherds, these said to one another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this which has happened, of which the Lord has informed us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And hastening thither, they found Mary and Joseph with the babe, who lay in the manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw this, they published what had been imparted to them, concerning this child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all who heard it, wondered at the things told them by the shepherds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Mary let none of these things escape unobserved, weighing every circumstance within herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God, for all that they had heard and seen, agreeably to what had been declared to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>On the eighth day, when the child was circumcised, they called him Jesus, the angel having given him that name, before his mother conceived him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the time of their purification was expired, they carried him to Jerusalem, as the law of Moses appoints, to present him to the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>«(as it is written in the law of God,'Every male, who is the first born of his mother, is consecrated to the Lord:')»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to offer the sacrifices enjoined in the law, a pair of turtle doves, or two young pigeons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there was at Jerusalem a man named Simeon, a just and religious man, who expected the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Spirit was upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and had revealed to him, that he should not dies, until he had seen the Lord's Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man came, guided by the Spirit, into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what the law required,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>he took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now, Lord, thou dost in peace dismiss thy servant, according to thy word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for my eyes have seen the Saviour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>whom thou hast provided in the sight of all the world,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a luminary to enlighten the nations, and to be the glory of Israel thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Joseph, and the mother of Jesus heard, with admiration, the things spoken concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, This child is destined for the fall and the rise of many in Israel, to serve as a mark for contradiction;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>(yes, you own soul shall be pierced as with a javelin;) that the thoughts of many hearts may be disclosed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>There was also a prophetess, Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher, in advanced age, who had lived seven years with a husband, whom she married when a virgin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and being now a widow about eighty-four years, departed not from the temple, but served God in prayer and fasting night and day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>she also coming in at that instant, gave thanks to the Lord, and spoke concerning Jesus to all those in Jerusalem who expected redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>After they had performed everything required by the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the child grew, and acquired strength of mind, being filled with wisdom, and adorned with a divine gracefulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now, the parents of Jesus went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when he was twelve years old, they having gone thither, according to the usage of the festival, and remained the customary time;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>being on their return, the child Jesus staid behind in Jerusalem, and neither Joseph nor his mother knew it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>They supposing him to be in the company, went a day's journey, and then sought him among their relations and acquaintances;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>but not finding him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And after three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all who heard him, were amazed at his understanding and answers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and they beheld him with astonishment. And his mother said to him, Son, why have you treated us thus? Behold, your father and I have sought you with sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He answered, Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be in the courts of my Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But they did not comprehend his answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he returned with them to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother treasured up all these things in her memory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and stature, and in power with God and man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
