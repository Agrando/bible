Having eaten nothing all that time, when it was ended he was hungry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and the devil said to him, If thou be God's Son, command this stone to become bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>«Jesus answered him, saying, It is written,'Man does not live by bread only, but by whatever God pleases.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the devil, having brought him to the top of a high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and said to him, All this power and glory I will give thee; for it is delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will, I give it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>if, therefore, thou wilt worship me, it shall all be thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>«Jesus answering, said, It is written,'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he brought him to Jerusalem, and placing him on the battlement of the temple, said to him, If thou be God's Son, throw thyself down hence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>«for it is written,» 'He will give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>«and, in their arms they shall uphold thee, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>«Jesus answered, It is said,'Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus, by the impulse of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and his renown spread throughout the whole country,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he taught in their synagogues with universal applause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Being come to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he entered the synagogue, as his custom was, on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they put into his hands the book of the Prophet Isaiah, and having opened the book, he found the place where it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>«The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, inasmuch as he has anointed me to publish glad tidings to the poor, to announce liberty to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to release the oppressed,»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>«to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having closed the book, and returned it to the servant, he sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he began with saying to them, This very day, the scripture which you have just now heard, is fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all extolled him; but being astonished at the gracious words which he uttered, they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>«He said to them, You will doubtless apply to me this proverb,» 'Physician, cure yourself.' 'Do as great things here in your own country, as we hear you have done in Capernaum.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in fact, added he, No prophet was ever well received in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I tell you of a truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when heaven was shut up for three years and a half, so that there was great famine throughout all the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>yet to none of them was Elijah sent, but to a widow in Sarepta, of Sidonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>There were likewise many lepers in Israel, in the days of Elisha the prophet; and Naaman the Syrian was cleansed, but none of those.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>On hearing this, the whole synagogue were enraged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and breaking up, drove him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the mountain on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he, passing through the midst of them, went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he came to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were struck with awe at his manner of teaching; for he spoke with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now there was in the synagogue a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, who roared out, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ah! Jesus of Nazareth, what hast thou to do with us? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art-the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him. On this, the demon, having thrown him into the middle of the assembly, came out without harming him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they were all in amazement, and said one to another, What does this mean, that with authority and power he command the unclean spirits, and they come out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>From that time, his fame was published in every corner of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When he was gone out of the synagogue, he entered the house of Simon, whose wife's mother had a violent fever, and they entreated him on her behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus, standing near her, rebuked the fever, and it left her, and she instantly arose, and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>After sunset, all they who had any sick, of whatever kind of disease, brought them to him; and he, laying his hands on every one, cured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Demons also came out of many, crying out, Thou art the Son of God. But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Messiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When it was day, he retired into a desert place; and the multitude sought him out, and came to him, and urged him not to leave them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but he said to them, I must publish the good tidings of the Reign of God in other cities also, because for this purpose I am sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Accordingly, he made this publication in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
