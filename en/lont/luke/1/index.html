and his wife, named Elizabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They were both righteous before God, blameless observers of all the Lord's commandments and ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were advanced in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now when he came to officiate as priest in the order of his course,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to offer incense in the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while the incense was burning, the whole congregation were praying without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Zacharias was discomposed at the sight, and in great terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias; for your prayer is heard, and Elizabeth your wife shall bear you a son, whom you shall name John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He shall be to you matter of joy and transport; and many shall rejoice because of his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he shall be great before the Lord; he shall not drink wine nor any fermented liquor; but he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And many of the sons of Israel he shall bring back to the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover, he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children, and by the wisdom of the righteous, to render the disobedient a people well disposed for the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this: for I am old man, and my wife is advanced in years?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, who attend in the presence of God, and am sent to tell you this joyful news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But know that you shall be dumb, and shall not recover your speech, till the day when these things happen, because you have not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in due time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Meanwhile the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered that he staid so long in the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary; for he made them understand by signs, and remained speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when his days of officiating were expired, he returned home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Soon after, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and lived in retirement five months, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Lord has done this for me, purposing now to deliver me from the reproach I lay under among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now, in the sixth month, God sent Gabriel his angel, to Nazareth, a city of Galilee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin betrothed to a man called Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When the angel entered, he said to her, Hail, favorite of heaven! the Lord be with you, happiest of women!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At his appearance and words, she was perplexed, and revolved in her mind what this salutation could mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And behold, you shall conceive and bear a son, whom you shall name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God will give him the throne of David his Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever: his reign shall never end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, since I have no intercourse with man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The angel answering, said to her, The Holy Spirit will descend upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore the holy progeny shall be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And lo! your cousin Elizabeth also has conceived, a son in her old age; and she who is called barren, is now in her sixth month;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for nothing is impossible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Be it to me according to your word. Then the angel departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>In those days Mary set out, and traveled expeditiously into the hill country; to a city of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>where having entered the house of Zacharias, she saluted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's salutation, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and cried with a loud voice, You are the most blessed of women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But how have I deserved this honor, to be visited by the mother of my Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for know, that as soon as the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And happy is she who believed that the things which the Lord has promised her, shall be performed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>because he has not disdained the low condition of his handmaid; for henceforth, all posterity will pronounce me happy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For the Almighty, whose name is venerable, has done wonders for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>His mercy on them who fear him, extends to generations of generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He displays the strength of his arm, and dispels the vain imaginations of the proud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He pulls down potentates from their thrones, and exalts the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The needy he loads with benefits; but the rich he spoils of everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He supports Israel his servant, ever inclined to mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>(as he promised to our fathers) toward Abraham and his race.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary, after staying with Elizabeth about three months, returned home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>When the time for Elizabeth's delivery was come, she brought forth a son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>and her neighbors and relations who heard that the Lord had shown her great kindness, rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And, on the eighth day, when they came to the circumcision of the child, they would have called him by his father's name, Zacharias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother interposed, saying, No; but he shall be called John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>They said to her, There is none of your kindred of that name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>They, therefore, asked his father by signs, how he would have him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>He, having demanded a table-book, wrote upon it, His name is John, which surprised them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And his mouth was opened directly, and his tongue loosed. And he spoke, praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Now all in the neighborhood were struck with awe; and the fame of these things spread throughout all the hill country of Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all who heard these things, pondering them in their hearts, said, What will this child hereafter be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then Zacharias, his father, being filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesied, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited and redeemed his people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and has raised a Prince for our deliverance in the house of David his servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>(as anciently he promised by his holy prophets)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>for our deliverance from our enemies, and from the hands of all who hate us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>in kindness to our forefathers, and remembrance of his holy institution;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>the oath which he swore to our father Abraham,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>to grant to us, that being rescued out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve him boldly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>in piety and uprightness all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And you, child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High; for you shall go before the Lord, to prepare his way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>by giving the knowledge of salvation to his people, in the remission of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>through the tender compassion of our God, who has caused a light to spring from on high to visit us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>to enlighten those who abide in darkness and in the shades of death; to direct our feet into the way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>Meantime the child grew, and acquired strength of mind, and continued in the deserts, until the time when he made himself known to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
