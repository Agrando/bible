Tell me, then,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Was the commission which John had to immerse, from heaven, or from men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they reasoned thus among themselves, If we say, From heaven, he will reply, Why, then, did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They therefore answered, that they could not tell whence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus replied, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he spoke to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and farmed it out, and having traveled, continued long abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The season being come, he sent a servant to the husbandmen, to receive of the produce of the vineyard; but they beat him, and sent him back empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterward, he sent another servant, whom they, having beaten, and used shamefully, also sent away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He afterward dispatched a third to them. Him, likewise, they wounded and drove away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the proprietor of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; they will surely reverence him, when they see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when then husbandmen saw him, they reasoned thus among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be our own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having thrust him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What, therefore, will the proprietor of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others. And some of his hearers said, God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>«Jesus, looking on them, said, What, then, means that expression of scripture,» 'A stone which the builders rejected, is made the head of the corner.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>«Whosoever shall fall upon that stone, shall be bruised; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush him to pieces?»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>At that time, the chief priests and the scribes, knowing that he had spoken this parable against them, would have laid hands on him, but feared the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they watched him, and set spies upon him, instructing them to personate conscientious men, and surprise him in his words, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the procurator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These accosted him with this question, Rabbi, we know that you speak and teach uprightly, and that, without respect of persons, you faithfully recommend the way of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Cesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He perceiving their subtlety, answered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Why would you entangle me? Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription has it? They answered, Cesar's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He replied, Render, therefore, to Cesar, that which is Cesar's, and to God, that which is God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus they could not surprise him in his discourses before the people; wherefore, admiring his answer, they kept silence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Afterward, some of the Sadducees, who deny a future state, came to him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>with this question: Rabbi, Moses has enjoined in his writings, that a man whose brother dies childless, outlived by his wife, shall marry the widow, and raise issue to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there were seven brothers; the first of whom, having taken a wife, died childless;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the second married the widow, and also died childless;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the third married her, as did likewise the rest; and all seven died, leaving no children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Last of all, the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>To which of them, therefore, will she be wife, at the resurrection; for she had been married to all the seven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answering, said to them, The people of this world marry, and are given in marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but, among them who shall be honored to share in the resurrection, and the other world, there will be neither marrying nor giving in marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for they can not die any more; because, like the angels, they are children of God, being children of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But that the dead are raised, even Moses has suggested, calling the Lord who appeared in the bush, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for they are all alive to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then some of the scribes said to him, Rabbi, you have spoken well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>After that, they did not venture to ask him any more questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he said to them, Why is it affirmed that the Messiah must be a son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>«Yet David himself says, in the book of the Psalms,» 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>«till I make thy foes thy footstool.»</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As David thus calls him his Lord, how can he be David's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then, in the audience of all the people, he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in robes, and affect salutations in public places, and the principal seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour the families of widows, and make long prayers for a disguise. These shall suffer the severest punishment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
