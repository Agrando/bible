And he arose and stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Jesus said to them, I would ask you, What is it lawful to do on the Sabbath? Good or ill? To save, or to destroy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And, looking around on them all, he said to the man, stretch out your hand; and in doing this, his hand was rendered sound like the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they were filled with madness, and consulted together, what they should do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In those days, Jesus retired to a mountain to pray, and spent the whole night in an oratory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When it was day, he called to him his disciples; and of them he chose twelve, whom he named Apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew, his brother, James, and John, Philip, and Bartholomew;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Matthew, and Thomas, James, son of Alpheus, and Simon called the Zealous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Judas, brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Afterward, Jesus, coming down with them, stopped on a plain, where a company of his disciples, with a vast multitude from all parts of Judea, Jerusalem, and the maritime country of Tyre and Sidon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>were come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases. Those also who were infested with unclean spirits, came, and were cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And every one strove to touch him, because a virtue came from him, which healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then fixing his eyes on his disciples, he said, Happy you poor, for the kingdom of God is yours!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Happy you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied! Happy you that weep now, for you shall laugh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Happy shall you be when men shall hate you, and separate your from their society; yes, reproach and defame you, on account of the Son of Man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice on that day, and triumph, knowing that your reward in heaven is great! for thus did their fathers treat the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But alas, for you rich; for you have received your comforts!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Alas, for you that are full; for you shall hunger! Alas, for you who laugh now; for you shall mourn and weep!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Alas, when all men shall speak well of you; for so did their fathers of the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I charge you, my hearers, love your enemies, do good to them who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless them who curse you, pray for them who traduce you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To him who smites you on one cheek, present the other; and from him who takes your mantle, withhold not your coat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to every one who asks you; and from him who takes away your goods, do not demand them back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you would that men should do to you, do you likewise to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For if you love those who love you, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners love those who love them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners lend to sinners, that they may received as much in return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies, do good and lend, nowise despairing; and your reward shall be great; and you shall be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and malignant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be therefore merciful, as your Father is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned; release, and you shall be released;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>give, and you shall get: good measure, pressed down and shaken, and heaped, shall be poured into your lap; for the very measure you give to others you yourself shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He also used this comparison: Can the blind guide the blind? Will not both fall into a ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple is not above his teacher; but every finished disciple shall be as his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why do you observe the mote in your brother's eyes; but perceive not the splinter in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Or how can you say to your brothers, Brother, let me take out the mote which is in your eye, not considering that there is a splinter out of your own eye; then you will see to take out the mote which is in your brother's eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>That is not a good tree which yields bad fruit; nor is that a bad tree which yields good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For every tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered off thorns; nor grapes off a bramble-bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings that which is good: the bad man out of the bad treasure of his heart, brings that which is bad; for it is out of the fulness of the heart that the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But why do you, in addressing me, cry, Master, Master, and obey not my commands!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Whoever comes to me and hears my precepts, and practices them, I will show you whom he resembles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>he resembles a man who built a house, and digging deep, laid the foundation upon the rock: and when an inundation came, the torrent broke upon that house, but could not shake it; for it was founded upon rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he who hears, and does not practice, resembles a man, who, without laying a foundation, built a house upon the earth: which, when the torrent broke against it, fell, and became a great pile of ruins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
