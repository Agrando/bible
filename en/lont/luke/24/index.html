And he went away, musing with astonishment on what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The same day, as two of the disciples were traveling to a village named Emmaus, sixty furlongs from Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>they conversed together about all these events.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>While they were conversing and reasoning, Jesus himself joined them, and went along with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But their eyes were so affected that they did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, What subjects are these about which you confer together? and why are you dejected?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And one of them, named Cleopas, answered, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and do you not know the things which have happened there so lately?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What things? said he. They answered, Concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet, powerful in word and deed, before God and all the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>how our chief priests and magistrates have delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As for us, we trusted that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel. Besides all this, today, being the third day since these things happened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>some women of our company have astonished us; for having gone early to the tomb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and not found his body, they came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he is alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some of our men went to the tomb, and found matters exactly as the women had related; but him they saw not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he said to them, O thoughtless men, and backward to believe things which have been all predicted by the prophets!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ought not the Messiah thus to suffer, and so to enter into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then beginning with Moses, and proceeding through all the prophets, he explained to them all the passages relating to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When they came near the village, whither they were traveling, he seemed as intending to go farther;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it grows late, and the day is far spent. And he went to abide with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>While they were at table together, he took the loaf, and blessed and broke it, and distributed to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he disappeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us on the road, and expounded to us the scriptures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Immediately they arose and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the eleven, and the rest of their company assembled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>who said, The Master is actually risen, and has appeared to Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>These also recounted what had happened on the road, and how he was made known to them in breaking the loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While they discoursed in this manner, he stood in the midst of them, and said, Peace be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they were amazed and affrighted, imagining that they saw a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, Why are you so alarmed? And wherefore do suspicious arise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Behold my hands and my feet; it is I myself; handle me and be convinced; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Saying this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While yet they believed not, for joy and amazement, he said to them, Have you here anything to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of a honeycomb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>which he took and eat in their presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said to them, This is what I told you while I remained with you, that all the things which are written of me in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, must be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved the Messiah to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that reformation and the remission of sins should be proclaimed, in his name, among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now, you are witnesses of these things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and behold I send you that which my Father has promised; but do you continue in this city, until you be invested with power from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He then led them out as far as Bethany, and lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And while he was blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And having worshiped him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and were constantly in the temple, praising and blessing God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
