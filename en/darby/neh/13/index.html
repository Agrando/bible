And I gathered them together and set them in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all Judah brought the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil into the storehouses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I made storekeepers over the storehouses: Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and subordinate to them, Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were esteemed faithful, and their office was to distribute to their brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds which I have done for the house of my God, and for the charges thereof!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days I saw in Judah some treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading them on asses; as also wine, grapes and figs, and all manner of burdens; and they brought them into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I protested in the day on which they sold the victuals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men of Tyre also dwelt therein, who brought fish and all manner of ware, and sold it on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said to them, What evil thing is this which ye do, profaning the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? And ye will bring more wrath against Israel by profaning the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, that when it began to be dark in the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut; and I commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath. And I set [some] of my servants at the gates, so that no burden should be brought in on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the dealers and sellers of all kind of ware passed the night without Jerusalem once or twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I testified against them, and said to them, Why do ye pass the night before the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came not on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to hallow the sabbath day. Remember this also for me, my God, and spare me according to thy great loving-kindness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In those days also I saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And their children spoke half in the language of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair, and adjured them by God [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? Yet among the many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; but even him did foreign wives cause to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And should we hearken to you to do all this great evil, to act unfaithfully to our God by marrying foreign wives?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And [one] of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; and I chased him from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Remember them, my God, for they are polluters of the priesthood, and of the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I purified them from all foreigners, and appointed the charges of the priests and the Levites, every one in his service;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
