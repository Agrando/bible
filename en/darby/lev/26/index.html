for I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ye shall observe my sabbaths, and my sanctuary shall ye reverence: I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If ye walk in my statutes, and observe my commandments and do them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>then I will give your rain in the season thereof, and the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing-time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land securely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will put away the evil beasts out of the land; and the sword shall not go through your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight; and your enemies shall fall beside you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will turn my face towards you and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And ye shall eat old store, and clear away the old because of the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will set my habitation among you; and my soul shall not abhor you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be to me a people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bands of your yoke, and made you walk upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if ye hearken not unto me, and do not all these commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if ye shall despise my statutes, and if your soul shall abhor mine ordinances, so that ye do not all my commandments, that ye break my covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also will do this unto you I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and fever, which shall cause the eyes to fail, and the soul to waste away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will set my face against you, that ye may be routed before your enemies; they that hate you shall have dominion over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if for this ye hearken not unto me, I will punish you sevenfold more for your sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and I will break the arrogance of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as bronze,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and your strength shall be spent in vain, and your land shall not yield its produce; and the trees of the land shall not yield their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring sevenfold more plagues upon you according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will send the beasts of the field among you, that they may rob you of your children, and cut off your cattle, and make you few in number; and your streets shall be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if ye will not be disciplined by me through these, but walk contrary unto me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will smite you, even I, sevenfold for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring a sword upon you that avengeth with the vengeance of the covenant, and ye shall be gathered together into your cities, and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I break the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and shall deliver you the bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if for this ye hearken not to me, but walk contrary unto me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven-fold for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will lay waste your high places, and cut down your sun-pillars, and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will lay waste your cities and desolate your sanctuaries; and I will not smell your sweet odours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will bring the land into desolation; that your enemies who dwell there in may be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I will scatter you among the nations, and will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be desolation, and your cities waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths all the days of the desolation, when ye are in your enemies' land; then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>All the days of the desolation it shall rest, [the days in] which it did not rest on your sabbaths, when ye dwelt therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as to those that remain of you I will send faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, that the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they shall stumble one over another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they that remain of you shall waste away through their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also through the iniquities of their fathers shall they waste away with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, through their unfaithfulness wherein they were unfaithful to me, and also that they have walked contrary unto me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>so that I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies. If then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the land shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, when it is in desolation without them; and they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they despised my judgments, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not despise them, and will not abhor them, to make an end of them utterly, to break my covenant with them, for I am Jehovah their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But I will remember toward them the covenant with their ancestors whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt before the eyes of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
