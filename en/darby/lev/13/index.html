and the priest shall look on him and pronounce him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But if the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and look not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white, the priest shall shut up [him that hath] the sore seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the priest shall look on him the seventh day; and behold, in his sight, the sore remaineth as it was, the sore hath not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days a second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day, and behold, the sore is become pale and the sore hath not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a scab; and he shall wash his garments and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the scab have spread much in the skin, after that he hath been seen by the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen by the priest again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the priest shall look on him, and behold, the scab hath spread in the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When a sore [as] of leprosy is in a man, he shall be brought unto the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the priest shall look on him, and behold, there is a white rising in the skin, and it hath turned the hair white, and a trace of raw flesh is in the rising:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and he shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if the leprosy break out much in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of [him that hath] the sore, from his head even to his foot, wherever the eyes of the priest look,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and the priest looketh, and behold, the leprosy covereth all his flesh, he shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the sore; it is all turned white; he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And on the day when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the priest shall look on the raw flesh, and shall pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if the raw flesh change again, and be turned white, he shall come unto the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the priest shall look on him, and behold, the sore is turned white; then the priest shall pronounce [him] clean [that hath] the sore: he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the flesh when in the skin thereof cometh a boil, and it is healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and there is in the place of the boil a white rising, or a white-reddish bright spot, it shall be shewn to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the priest shall look on it, and behold, it looketh deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof is turned white; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the sore of leprosy broken out in the boil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the priest look on it, and behold, there are no white hairs therein, and it is not deeper than the skin, and is pale, the priest shall shut him up seven days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and if it spread much in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if the bright spot have remained in its place, [and] have not spread, it is the scar of the boil;

and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if a man or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, white bright spots,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the priest look, and behold, there are in the skin of their flesh pale white spots, it is an eruption which is broken out in the skin: he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if a man's hair have fallen off his head, he is bald: he is clean;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and if he have the hair fallen off from the part of the head towards his face, he is forehead-bald: he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white-reddish sore, it is a leprosy which hath broken out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the priest shall look on it, and behold, the rising of the sore is white-reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, like the appearance of the leprosy in the skin of the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his sore is in his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And as to the leper in whom the sore is, his garments shall be rent, and his head shall be uncovered, and he shall put a covering on his beard, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>All the days that the sore shall be in him he shall be unclean: he is unclean;
