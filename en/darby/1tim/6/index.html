These things teach and exhort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If any one teach differently, and do not accede to sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which [is] according to piety,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and disputes of words, out of which arise envy, strife, injurious words, evil suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>constant quarrellings of men corrupted in mind and destitute of the truth, holding gain to be [the end of] piety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But piety with contentment *is* great gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we have brought nothing into the world: [it is] [manifest] that neither can we carry anything out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But having sustenance and covering, we will be content with these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many unwise and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into destruction and ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is [the] root of every evil; which some having aspired after, have wandered from the faith, and pierced themselves with many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But *thou*, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Strive earnestly [in] the good conflict of faith. Lay hold of eternal life, to which thou hast been called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I enjoin thee before God who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that thou keep the commandment spotless, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall shew, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom [be] honour and eternal might. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Enjoin on those rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to trust on the uncertainty of riches; but in the God who affords us all things richly for [our] enjoyment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to do good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal in distributing, disposed to communicate [of their substance],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of [what is] really life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timotheus, keep the entrusted deposit, avoiding profane, vain babblings, and oppositions of false-named knowledge,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>of which some having made profession, have missed the faith. Grace [be] with thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
