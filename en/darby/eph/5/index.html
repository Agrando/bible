but rather thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this ye are [well] informed of, knowing that no fornicator, or unclean person, or person of unbridled lust, who is an idolater, has inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let no one deceive you with vain words, for on account of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be not ye therefore fellow-partakers with them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for ye were once darkness, but now light in [the] Lord; walk as children of light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(for the fruit of the light [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>proving what is agreeable to the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather also reprove [them],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the things that are done by them in secret it is shameful even to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But all things having their true character exposed by the light are made manifest; for that which makes everything manifest is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore he says, Wake up, [thou] that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See therefore how ye walk carefully, not as unwise but as wise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this reason be not foolish, but understanding what [is] the will of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>giving thanks at all times for all things to him [who is] God and [the] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>submitting yourselves to one another in [the] fear of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, [submit yourselves] to your own husbands, as to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for a husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ [is] head of the assembly. *He* [is] Saviour of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But even as the assembly is subjected to the Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in order that he might sanctify it, purifying [it] by the washing of water by [the] word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that *he* might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So ought men also to love their own wives as their own bodies: he that loves his own wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for we are members of his body; [we are of his flesh, and of his bones.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This mystery is great, but *I* speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But *ye* also, every one of you, let each so love his own wife as himself; but as to the wife [I speak] that she may fear the husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
