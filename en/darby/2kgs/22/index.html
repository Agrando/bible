And Hilkijah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again and said, Thy servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Shaphan the scribe informed the king saying, Hilkijah the priest has given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass when the king heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king commanded Hilkijah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go, inquire of Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book which is found; for great is the wrath of Jehovah that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened to the words of this book, to do according to all that is written [there] for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hilkijah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe: now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter [of the town]; and they spoke with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Tell the man that sent you to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof, all the words of the book that the king of Judah hath read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my fury is kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Jehovah, thus shall ye say to him: Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel touching the words which thou hast heard:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Because thy heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before Jehovah, when thou heardest what I spoke against this place and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and didst rend thy garments and weep before me, I also have heard [thee], saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, behold, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil that I will bring upon this place.
