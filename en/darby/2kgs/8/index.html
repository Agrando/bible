And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the king asked the woman, and she told him. And the king appointed a certain chamberlain, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the revenue of the land since the day that she left the country even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Elisha came to Damascus; and Ben-Hadad the king of Syria was sick; and it was told him saying, The man of God is come hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the king said to Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God, and inquire of Jehovah by him, saying, Shall I recover from this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Hazael went to meet him, and took with him a present, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden; and he came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Ben-Hadad king of Syria has sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover from this disease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha said to him, Go, say to him, Thou wilt certainly recover. But Jehovah has shewn me that he shall certainly die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Hazael said, Why does my lord weep? And he said, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do to the children of Israel: their strongholds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou kill with the sword, and wilt dash in pieces their children, and rip up their women with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha said, Jehovah has shewn me that thou wilt be king over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who said to him, What did Elisha say to thee? And he said, He told me [that] thou wouldest certainly recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass the next day, that he took the coverlet and dipped [it] in water, and spread it over his face, so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the sight of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jehovah would not destroy Judah, for David his servant's sake, as he had promised him to give him always a lamp for his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and they set a king over themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him; and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites who had surrounded him, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled into their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, began to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem; and his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of Jehovah, like the house of Ahab; for he was the son-in-law of the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael the king of Syria at Ramoth-Gilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And king Joram returned to be healed in Jizreel of the wounds that the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to see Joram the son of Ahab at Jizreel, for he was sick.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
