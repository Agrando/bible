And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand [shekels] of gold, and ten changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, And now, when this letter comes to thee, behold, I have sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest cure him of his leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his garments, and said, Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeks an occasion against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his garments, that he sent to the king, saying, Why hast thou rent thy garments? let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at the doorway of the house of Elisha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Naaman was wroth, and went away and said, Behold, I thought, He will certainly come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of Jehovah his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are not the Abanah and the Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them and be clean? And he turned and went away in a rage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his servants drew near, and spoke to him and said, My father, [if] the prophet had bidden thee [do some] great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he says to thee, Wash and be clean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he went down, and plunged himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God. And his flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him; and he said, Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; and now, I pray thee, take a present of thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said, As Jehovah liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none! And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Naaman said, If not, then let there, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of [this] earth; for thy servant will no more offer burnt-offering and sacrifice to other gods, but to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In this thing Jehovah pardon thy servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to bow down there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, Jehovah pardon thy servant, I pray thee, in this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Go in peace. And he departed from him a little way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman, this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought; but as Jehovah liveth, I will run after him and take somewhat of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he sprang down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said, All is well. My master has sent me saying, Behold, even now there are come to me from mount Ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Naaman said, Consent to take two talents. And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of raiment, and laid them upon two of his young men; and they bore them before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and stowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he entered in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, Whence [comest thou], Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to him, Did not my heart go, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and bondmen, and bondwomen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the leprosy of Naaman shall fasten upon thee, and upon thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence leprous, as snow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
