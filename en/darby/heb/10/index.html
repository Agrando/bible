He takes away the first that he may establish the second;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every priest stands daily ministering, and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But *he*, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down in perpetuity at [the] right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>waiting from henceforth until his enemies be set [for the] footstool of his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness [of it]; for after what was said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This [is] the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith [the] Lord: Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But where there [is] remission of these, [there is] no longer a sacrifice for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the [holy of] holies by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the new and living way which he has dedicated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and [having] a great priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us approach with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, sprinkled as to our hearts from a wicked conscience, and washed as to our body with pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold fast the confession of the hope unwavering, (for he [is] faithful who has promised;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and let us consider one another for provoking to love and good works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom [is] with some; but encouraging [one another], and by so much the more as ye see the day drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For where we sin wilfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains any sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and heat of fire about to devour the adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Any one that has disregarded Moses' law dies without mercy on [the testimony of] two or three witnesses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>of how much worse punishment, think ye, shall he be judged worthy who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and esteemed the blood of the covenant, whereby he has been sanctified, common, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know him that said, To me [belongs] vengeance; *I* will recompense, saith the Lord: and again, The Lord shall judge his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[It is] a fearful thing falling into [the] hands of [the] living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But call to mind the earlier days in which, having been enlightened, ye endured much conflict of sufferings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>on the one hand, when ye were made a spectacle both in reproaches and afflictions; and on the other, when ye became partakers with those who were passing through them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For ye both sympathised with prisoners and accepted with joy the plunder of your goods, knowing that ye have for yourselves a better substance, and an abiding one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For ye have need of endurance in order that, having done the will of God, ye may receive the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For yet a very little while he that comes will come, and will not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the just shall live by faith; and, if he draw back, my soul does not take pleasure in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But *we* are not drawers back to perdition, but of faith to saving [the] soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
