For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing unsubject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to *him*,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but we see Jesus, who [was] made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste death for every thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified [are] all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in [the] midst of [the] assembly will I sing thy praises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, I will trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children which God has given me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he does not indeed take hold of angels [by the hand], but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
