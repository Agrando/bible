For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them who seek him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith, Noah, oracularly warned concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which [is] according to faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance, and went out, not knowing where he was going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he sojourned as a stranger in the land of promise as a foreign country, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with [him] of the same promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he waited for the city which has foundations, of which God is [the] artificer and constructor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith also Sarah herself received strength for [the] conception of seed, and [that] beyond a seasonable age; since she counted him faithful who promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore also there have been born of one, and that of one become dead, even as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the countless sand which [is] by the sea shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar off and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they who say such things shew clearly that they seek [their] country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if they had called to mind that from whence they went out, they had had opportunity to have returned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but now they seek a better, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, [when] tried, offered up Isaac, and he who had received to himself the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>as to whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>counting that God [was] able to raise [him] even from among [the] dead, whence also he received him in a figure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob [when] dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped on the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph [when] dying called to mind the going forth of the sons of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, being born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child beautiful; and they did not fear the injunction of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he had become great, refused to be called son of Pharaoh's daughter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God than to have [the] temporary pleasure of sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he had respect to the recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith he celebrated the passover and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they passed through the Red sea as through dry land; of which the Egyptians having made trial were swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with the unbelieving, having received the spies in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what more do I say? For the time would fail me telling of Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah, and David and Samuel, and of the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who by faith overcame kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped lions' mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>quenched [the] power of fire, escaped [the] edge of the sword, became strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, made [the] armies of strangers give way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received their dead again by resurrection; and others were tortured, not having accepted deliverance, that they might get a better resurrection;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and others underwent trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, and of bonds and imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, were sawn asunder, were tempted, died by the death of the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, evil treated,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>(of whom the world was not worthy,) wandering in deserts and mountains, and [in] dens and caverns of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And these all, having obtained witness through faith, did not receive the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God having foreseen some better thing for us, that they should not be made perfect without us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
