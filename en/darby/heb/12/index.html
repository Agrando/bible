For if those did not escape who had refused him who uttered the oracles on earth, much more we who turn away from him [who does so] from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, Yet once will *I* shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But this Yet once, signifies the removing of what is shaken, as being made, that what is not shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherefore let us, receiving a kingdom not to be shaken, have grace, by which let us serve God acceptably with reverence and fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For also our God [is] a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
