the first, in which [were] both the candlestick and the table and the exposition of the loaves, which is called Holy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but after the second veil a tabernacle which is called Holy of holies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which [were] the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and above over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which it is not now [the time] to speak in detail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests enter at all times, accomplishing the services;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but into the second, the high priest only, once a year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the [holy of] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has [its] standing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>the which [is] an image for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices, unable to perfect as to conscience him that worshipped, are offered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>[consisting] only of meats and drinks and divers washings, ordinances of flesh, imposed until [the] time of setting things right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Christ being come high priest of the good things to come, by the better and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, (that is, not of this creation,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>nor by blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the [holy of] holies, having found an eternal redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship [the] living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And for this reason he is mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(For where [there is] a testament, the death of the testator must needs come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For a testament [is] of force when men are dead, since it is in no way of force while the testator is alive.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whence neither the first was inaugurated without blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For every commandment having been spoken according to [the] law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the tabernacle too and all the vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and almost all things are purified with blood according to the law, and without blood-shedding there is no remission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[It was] necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>since he had [then] been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world. But now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for [the] putting away of sin by his sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die, and after this judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>thus the Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
