Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which are become a prey and a derision to the remnant of the nations that are round about,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Surely in the fire of my jealousy have I spoken against the remnant of the nations, and against the whole of Edom, which have appointed my land unto themselves for a possession with the joy of all [their] heart, with despite of soul, to plunder it by pillage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the water-courses and to the valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury, because ye have borne the ignominy of the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I have lifted up my hand, [saying,] Verily the nations that are about you, they shall bear their shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And ye mountains of Israel shall shoot forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people Israel: for they are at hand to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, the whole of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will multiply upon you man and beast, and they shall increase and bring forth fruit; and I will cause you to be inhabited as [in] your former times, yea, I will make it better than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because they say unto you, Thou devourest men, and hast bereaved thy nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nation any more, saith the Lord Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>neither will I cause thee to hear the ignominy of the nations any more, and thou shalt not bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nation to fall any more, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of a woman in her separation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I poured out my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they came to the nations whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when it was said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and they are gone forth out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I had pity for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations whither they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations whither ye went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will hallow my great name, which was profaned among the nations, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I [am] Jehovah, saith the Lord Jehovah, when I shall be hallowed in you before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean: from all your uncleannesses and from all your idols will I cleanse you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances, and ye shall do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I will save you from all your uncleannesses; and I will call for the corn and will multiply it, and lay no famine upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will multiply the fruit of the trees and the increase of the field, so that ye may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And ye shall remember your evil ways, and your doings which were not good, and shall loathe yourselves for your iniquities and for your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord Jehovah, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: In the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities I will also cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be builded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all that passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities [are] fortified [and] inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the nations that shall be left round about you shall know that I Jehovah build the ruined places [and] plant that which was desolate: I Jehovah have spoken, and I will do [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it unto them; I will increase them with men like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her set feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
