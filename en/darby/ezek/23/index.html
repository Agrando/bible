As for their names: Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she lusted after her lovers, after the Assyrians [her] neighbours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them attractive young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, all of them the choice of the children of Asshur; and with all after whom she lusted, with all their idols she defiled herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Neither left she her whoredoms [brought] from Egypt; for in her youth they had lain with her, and had handled the breasts of her virginity, and poured their fornication upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the children of Asshur, after whom she lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>These discovered her nakedness, they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword; and she became a name among women; and they executed judgment upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And her sister Oholibah saw [this], and was more corrupt in her passion than she, and in her fornications more than the whoredoms of her sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She lusted after the children of Asshur [her] neighbours, governors and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them attractive young men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I saw that she was defiled: both took one way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she increased her fornications; for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>girded with girdles upon their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them captains in appearance, [after] the likeness of the children of Babylon, of Chaldea, the land of their nativity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she lusted after them, and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Babylon came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their fornication; she too defiled herself with them, and her soul was alienated from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she discovered her whoredoms, and discovered her nakedness; and my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she played the harlot in the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and she lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is [as] the flesh of asses, and whose issue is [as] the issue of horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And thou didst look back to the lewdness of thy youth, in the handling of thy teats by the Egyptians, for the breasts of thy youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, Oholibah, thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all the children of Asshur with them; all of them attractive young men, governors and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall come against thee [with] armour, chariots and wheels, and with an assemblage of peoples; they shall set themselves against thee [with] target, and shield, and helmet round about; and I will put judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall cut off thy nose and thine ears, and thy remnant shall fall by the sword; they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They shall also strip the of thy garments, and take away thy fair jewels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy whoredom [brought] from the land of Egypt; and thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give thee over into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy soul is alienated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare; so that the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy fornications.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>These things shall be done unto thee, because thou hast gone a whoring after the nations, because thou hast defiled thyself with their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; and I have given her cup into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Thou shalt drink of thy sister's cup deep and large; thou shalt be for a laughing-stock and a derision, [for] it containeth much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, the cup of thy sister Samaria;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>thou shalt even drink it and suck it out, and thou shalt gnaw the sherds thereof, and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken [it], saith the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy fornications.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jehovah said unto me, Son of man, wilt thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? yea, declare unto them their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also passed over unto them their children, whom they bore unto me, to be devoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Moreover this have they done unto me: in the same day have they defiled my sanctuary and profaned my sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For when they had slaughtered their children unto their idols, they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And furthermore, they sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and behold, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thine eyes, and deckedst thyself with ornaments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and satest upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou hadst set mine incense and mine oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the voice of a multitude living carelessly was with her; and with people of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, and they put bracelets upon their hands, and a beautiful crown upon their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And I said of her that was old in adulteries, Will she now commit her fornications, even she.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they went in unto her, as they go in unto a whorish woman: so went they in unto Oholah and unto Oholibah the lewd women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women that shed blood; for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will bring up an assemblage against them, and will give them to be driven hither and thither and spoiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And the assemblage shall stone them with stones, and despatch them with their swords; they shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, and all women shall receive instruction and shall not do according to your lewdness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
