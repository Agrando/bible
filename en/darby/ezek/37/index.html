And I said, Lord Jehovah, thou knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said unto me, Prophesy over these bones, and say unto them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will put sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye shall live: and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold a rustling, and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I looked, and behold, sinews and flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that they may live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I prophesied as he had commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel.
