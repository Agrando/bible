thou shalt not be brought together nor gathered: I will give thee for meat to the beasts of the earth and to the fowl of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I [am] Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst give way and rend all their shoulder; and when they leaned upon thee, thou didst break, and didst make all their loins to tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring a sword upon thee, and cut off man and beast from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste: and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah, because he saith, The river is mine, and I made it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore behold, I am against thee, and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt deserts of wasteness and desolation, from Migdol to Syene, even unto the border of Ethiopia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No foot of man shall pass through it, nor shall foot of beast pass through it, nor shall it be inhabited, forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst of the countries that are desolated, and her cities shall be, in the midst of the cities that are laid waste, a desolation forty years; and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet thus saith the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years will I gather the Egyptians from the peoples whither they were scattered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and I will turn again the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them to return to the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth, and they shall there be a base kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It shall be the basest of kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations; and I will diminish them, so that they shall no more rule over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel, bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they turn after them: and they shall know that I [am] the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first [month], on the first of the month, [that] the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to do hard service against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he from Tyre no wages, nor his army, for the service that he had served against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall carry away her multitude, and seize her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it, because they wrought for me, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that day will I cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them: and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
