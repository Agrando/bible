the other was at the side of the south gate, the front towards the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he said unto me, This cell whose front is towards the south is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the cell whose front is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar.
