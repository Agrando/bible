And the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, south of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me round outside unto the outer gate towards [the gate] that looketh eastward; and behold, waters ran out on the right side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When the man went forth eastward, a line was in his hand; and he measured a thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass through the waters: the waters were to the ankles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he measured a thousand [cubits], and caused me to pass through the waters: the waters were to the knees. And he measured a thousand and caused me to pass through: the waters were to the loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he measured a thousand: it was a river that I could not pass through, for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen [this]? And he led me, and brought me back to the bank of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When I returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said unto me, These waters issue out toward the east district, and go down into the plain, and go into the sea; when they are brought forth into the sea, the waters [thereof] shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall come to pass that every living thing which moveth, whithersoever the double river shall come, shall live.
