Shall he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither? All its fresh sprouting leaves shall wither, even without a great arm and many people to pluck it up by its roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it? It shall wither in the beds where it grew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things are? Say, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king and its princes, and led them with him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he took of the king's seed, and made a covenant with him, and brought him under an oath, and he took away the mighty of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that the kingdom might be abased, that it might not lift itself up, that it might keep his covenant in order to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[As] I live, saith the Lord Jehovah, verily in the place of the king that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him, in the midst of Babylon, shall he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither shall Pharaoh with a mighty army and a great assemblage do anything for him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts to cut off many persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He despised the oath, and broke the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, yet hath he done all these things: he shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: [As] I live, verily, mine oath which he hath despised, and my covenant which he hath broken, even it will I recompense upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare; and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his unfaithfulness in which he hath been unfaithful against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind; and ye shall know that I Jehovah have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will also take of the highest branch of the lofty cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of its young shoots a tender one, and I will plant it upon a high and eminent mountain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>upon the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth branches, and bear fruit, and become a noble cedar; and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the trees of the field shall know that I Jehovah have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and made the dry tree to flourish: I Jehovah have spoken, and will do [it].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
