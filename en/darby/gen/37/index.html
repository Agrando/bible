Joseph, being seventeen years old, fed the flock with his brethren; and he was doing service with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. And Joseph brought to his father an evil report of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons, because he was son of his old age; and he made him a vest of many colours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, and they hated him, and could not greet him with friendliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joseph dreamed a dream, and told [it] to his brethren, and they hated him yet the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, Hear, I pray you, this dream, which I have dreamt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, we were binding sheaves in the fields, and lo, my sheaf rose up, and remained standing; and behold, your sheaves came round about and bowed down to my sheaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his brethren said to him, Wilt thou indeed be a king over us? wilt thou indeed rule over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamt another dream, and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed down to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he told [it] to his father and to his brethren. And his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream which thou hast dreamt? Shall we indeed come, I and thy mother and thy brethren, to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And his brethren went to feed their father's flock at Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Israel said to Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed [the flock] at Shechem? Come, that I may send thee to them. And he said to him, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see after the welfare of thy brethren, and after the welfare of the flock; and bring me word again. And he sent him out of the vale of Hebron; and he came towards Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the country; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed [their flocks].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man said, They have removed from this; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them at Dothan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they saw him from afar, and before he came near to them, they conspired against him to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said one to another, Behold, there comes that dreamer!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now come and let us kill him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast has devoured him; and we will see what becomes of his dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Reuben heard [it], and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben said to them, Shed no blood: cast him into this pit which is in the wilderness; but lay no hand upon him in order that he might deliver him out of their hand, to bring him to his father again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass when Joseph came to his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his vest, the vest of many colours, which he had on;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they took him and cast him into the pit; now the pit was empty there was no water in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites came from Gilead; and their camels bore tragacanth, and balsam, and ladanum going to carry [it] down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah said to his brethren, What profit is it that we kill our brother and secrete his blood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites; but let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened [to him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Midianitish men, merchants, passed by; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty silver-pieces; and they brought Joseph to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Reuben returned to the pit, and behold, Joseph [was] not in the pit; and he rent his garments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and returned to his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, where shall I go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they took Joseph's vest, and slaughtered a buck of the goats, and dipped the vest in the blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they sent the vest of many colours and had it carried to their father, and said, This have we found: discern now whether it is thy son's vest or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he discerned it, and said, [It is] my son's vest! an evil beast has devoured him: Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and said, For I will go down to my son into Sheol mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the Midianites sold him into Egypt, to Potiphar, a chamberlain of Pharaoh, the captain of the life-guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
