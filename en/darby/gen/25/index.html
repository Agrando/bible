All these were sons of Keturah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and, while he yet lived, sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward to the east country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived: a hundred and seventy-five years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, old and full [of days]; and was gathered to his peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which was opposite to Mamre</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the field that Abraham had purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac.

He settled before the face of all his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begot Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren; and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebecca his wife conceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; And one people shall be stronger than the other people, And the elder shall serve the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the first came out red all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after that came his brother out; and his hand took hold of Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the boys grew, and Esau became a man skilled in hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob was a homely man, dwelling in tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Isaac loved Esau, because venison was to his taste; and Rebecca loved Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob had cooked a dish; and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with the red the red thing there, for I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jacob said, Sell me now thy birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and of what use can the birthright be to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jacob said, Swear unto me now. And he swore unto him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jacob gave Esau bread and the dish of lentils; and he ate and drank, and rose up and went away. Thus Esau despised the birthright.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
