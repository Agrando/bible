And Tamar went and remained in her father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as the days were multiplied, Judah's wife, the daughter of Shua, died. And Judah was comforted, and he went up to his sheep-shearers, to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she put the garments of her widowhood off from her, and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the entry of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Judah saw her, and took her for a harlot; because she had covered her face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me go in to thee; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, I will send [thee] a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, until thou send it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy lace, and thy staff which is in thy hand. And he gave [it] her, and went in to her; and she conceived by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she arose and went away; and she laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand; but he found her not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute that was at Enaim, by the way-side? And they said, There was no prostitute here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, No prostitute has been here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Judah said, Let her take [it] for herself, lest we be put to shame. Behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law has committed fornication, and behold, she is also with child by fornication. And Judah said, Bring her forth, that she may be burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these [belong] am I with child; and she said, Acknowledge, I pray thee, whose are this signet, and this lace, and this staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She is more righteous than I, because I have not given her to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass at the time of her delivery, that behold, twins were in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass when she brought forth, that one stretched out [his] hand, and the midwife took it and bound round his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth! on thee be the breach! And they called his name Pherez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And afterwards came out his brother, round whose hand was the scarlet thread; and they called his name Zerah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
