And Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to her, Is it [too] little that thou hast taken my husband, that thou wilt take my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Jacob came from the fields in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me, for indeed I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob a fifth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have given my maidservant to my husband; and she called his name Issachar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Leah again conceived, and bore Jacob a sixth son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry; this time will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons. And she called his name Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she conceived, and bore a son, and said, God has taken away my reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she called his name Joseph; and said, Jehovah will add to me another son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my place and to my country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Give [me] my wives for whom I have served thee, and my children; that I may go away, for thou knowest my service which I have served thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes I have discovered that Jehovah has blessed me for thy sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Appoint to me thy wages, and I will give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and what thy cattle has become with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For it was little that thou hadst before me, and it is increased to a multitude, and Jehovah has blessed thee from the time I came; and now, when shall I also provide for my house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me anything. If thou doest this for me, I will again feed [and] keep thy flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I will pass through all thy flock to-day, to remove thence all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and [that] shall be my hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And my righteousness shall answer for me hereafter, when thou comest about my hire, before thy face: all that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the lambs, let that be stolen with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Laban said, Well, let it be according to thy word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the brown among the lambs, and gave [them] into the hand of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he put three days' journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jacob took fresh rods of white poplar, almond-tree, and maple; and peeled off white stripes in them, uncovering the white which was on the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flock, in the troughs at the watering-places where the flock came to drink, and they were ardent when they came to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the flock was ardent before the rods; and the flock brought forth ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flock toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he made himself separate flocks, and did not put them with Laban's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass whensoever the strong cattle were ardent, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might become ardent among the rods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but when the sheep were feeble, he put [them] not in; so the feeble were Laban's, and the strong Jacob's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the man increased very, very much, and had much cattle, and bondwomen, and bondmen, and camels, and asses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
