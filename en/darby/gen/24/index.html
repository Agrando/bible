And she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, sip a little water out of thy pitcher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Drink, my lord! And she hasted and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when she had given him enough to drink, she said, I will draw [water] for thy camels also, until they have drunk enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw [water]; and she drew for all his camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man was astonished at her, remaining silent, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass when the camels had drunk enough, that the man took a gold ring, of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands, ten [shekels] weight of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee. Is there room [in] thy father's house for us to lodge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she said to him, There is straw, and also much provender with us; also room to lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the man stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and said, Blessed be Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has not withdrawn his loving-kindness and his faithfulness from my master; I being in the way, Jehovah has led me to the house of my master's brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the maiden ran and told these things to her mother's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Rebecca had a brother, named Laban; and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass when he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister's hand, and when he heard the words of Rebecca his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me that he came to the man, and behold, he was standing by the camels, by the well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Come in, blessed of Jehovah! why standest thou outside? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the man came into the house; and he ungirded the camels, and gave the camels straw and provender, and water to wash his feet, and the feet of the men who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there was set [meat] before him to eat; but he said, I will not eat until I have made known my business. And he said, Speak on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I am Abraham's servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly, and he is become great; and he has given him sheep and cattle, and silver and gold, and bondmen and bondwomen, and camels and asses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master after she had grown old; and unto him has he given all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanite, in whose land I am dwelling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but thou shalt by all means go to my father's house and to my family, and take a wife for my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way, that thou mayest take a wife for my son of my family, and out of my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then shalt thou be quit of my oath, when thou shalt have come to my family. And if they give thee not [one], thou shalt be quit of my oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I came this day to the well, and said, Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, if now thou wilt prosper my way on which I go,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>behold, I stand by the well of water, and let it come to pass that the damsel who cometh forth to draw [water], and to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water out of thy pitcher to drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels that she should be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master's son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Before I ended speaking in my heart, behold, Rebecca came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder, and went down to the well, and drew [water]; and I said to her, Give me, I pray thee, to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And she hasted and let down her pitcher from her [shoulder], and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. And I drank; and she gave the camels drink also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And I stooped, and bowed down before Jehovah; and I blessed Jehovah, God of my master Abraham, who has led me the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And now, if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me; and I will turn to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from Jehovah: we cannot speak to thee bad or good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, Rebecca is before thee: take [her], and go away; and let her be wife of thy master's son, as Jehovah has said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And it came to pass, when Abraham's servant heard their words, that he bowed down to the earth before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the servant brought forth silver articles, and gold articles, and clothing, and he gave [them] to Rebecca; and he gave to her brother, and to her mother, precious things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and lodged. And they rose up in the morning; and he said, Send me away to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her brother and her mother said, Let the maiden abide with us [some] days, or [say] ten; after that she shall go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And he said to them, Do not hinder me, seeing Jehovah has prospered my way: send me away, and I will go to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they said, Let us call the maiden and inquire at her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And they called Rebecca and said to her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And they sent away Rebecca their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they blessed Rebecca, and said to her, Thou art our sister; mayest thou become thousands of tens of thousands; and may thy seed possess the gate of their enemies!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Rebecca arose, and her maids, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebecca, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Isaac had just returned from Beer-lahai-roi; for he was dwelling in the south country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Isaac had gone out to meditate in the fields toward the beginning of evening. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, camels were coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And Rebecca lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, and she sprang off the camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And she had said to the servant, Who is the man that is walking in the fields to meet us? And the servant said, That is my master! Then she took the veil, and covered herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Isaac led her into his mother Sarah's tent; and he took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after [the death of] his mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
