And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the sheep for a burnt-offering?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself with the sheep for a burnt-offering. And they went both of them together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built the altar there, and piled the wood; and he bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abraham stretched out his hand, and took the knife to slaughter his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Angel of Jehovah called to him from the heavens, and said, Abraham, Abraham! And he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Stretch not out thy hand against the lad, neither do anything to him; for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son], from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind was a ram caught in the thicket by its horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up for a burnt-offering instead of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh; as it is said at the present day, On the mount of Jehovah will be provided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Angel of Jehovah called to Abraham from the heavens a second time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said, By myself I swear, saith Jehovah, that, because thou hast done this, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will richly bless thee, and greatly multiply thy seed, as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is on the sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless themselves, because thou hast hearkened to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also has borne sons to thy brother Nahor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(And Bethuel begot Rebecca.)
