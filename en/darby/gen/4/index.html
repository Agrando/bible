And Abel was a shepherd, but Cain was a husbandman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat. And Jehovah looked upon Abel, and on his offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and upon Cain, and on his offering, he did not look. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah said to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why is thy countenance fallen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If thou doest well, will not [thy countenance] look up [with confidence]? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield thee its strength; a wanderer and fugitive shalt thou be on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is too great to be borne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a wanderer and fugitive on the earth; and it will come to pass, [that] every one who finds me will slay me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever slayeth Cain, it shall be revenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, toward the east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city; and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lemech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lemech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and [breed] cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of those who handle the harp and pipe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, the forger of every kind of tool of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice, Ye wives of Lemech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for my wound, and a youth for my bruise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold; Lemech seventy and seven fold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth: For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
