For I have borne [him] a son in his old age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she said to Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son with Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy handmaid: [in] all that Sarah hath said to thee hearken to her voice, for in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But also the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a flask of water, and gave [it] to Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder and the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the water was exhausted from the flask; and she cast the child under one of the shrubs,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and she went and sat down over against [him], a bow-shot off; for she said, Let me not behold the death of the child. And she sat over against [him], and lifted up her voice and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God heard the voice of the lad. And the Angel of God called to Hagar from the heavens, and said to her, What [aileth] thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad there, where he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise, take the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make of him a great nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the flask with water, and gave the lad drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech, and Phichol the captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal deceitfully with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson. According to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou sojournest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Abraham said, I will swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water that Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this, neither hast thou told me [of it], neither have I heard [of it] but to-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Abimelech said to Abraham, What [mean] these seven ewe-lambs, these which thou hast set by themselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand, that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there they had sworn, both of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the captain of his host, and returned into the land of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
