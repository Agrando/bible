And the land behold, it is of wide extent before them. We will take their daughters as wives, and give them our daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But only in this will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people if every male among us be circumcised, just as they are circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Their cattle, and their possessions, and every beast of theirs, shall they not be ours? only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all that went out at the gate of his city hearkened to Hamor and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised all that went out at the gate of his city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each his sword, and came upon the city boldly, and slew all the males.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Hamor and Shechem his son they slew with the edge of the sword; and took Dinah out of Shechem's house; and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and what [was] in the city, and what [was] in the field they took;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and all their goods, and all their little ones, and their wives took they captive, and plundered them, and all that was in the houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, in that ye make me odious among the inhabitants of the land among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and I am few men in number, and they will gather themselves against me and smite me, and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said, Should people deal with our sister as with a harlot?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
