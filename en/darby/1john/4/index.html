From this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another; because love is of God, and every one that loves has been begotten of God, and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that loves not has not known God; for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Herein as to us has been manifested the love of God, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No one has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God abides in us, and his love is perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, that he has given to us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And *we* have seen, and testify, that the Father has sent the Son [as] Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And *we* have known and have believed the love which God has to us. God is love, and he that abides in love abides in God, and God in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Herein has love been perfected with us that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, that even as *he* is, *we* also are in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear; for fear has torment, and he that fears has not been made perfect in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>*We* love because *he* has first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If any one say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he that loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this commandment have we from him, That he that loves God love also his brother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
