Hereby we know that we are in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that says he abides in him ought, even as *he* walked, himself also [so] to walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment, which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, I write a new commandment to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing and the true light already shines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in the darkness until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that loves his brother abides in light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he that hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and knows not where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I write to you, children, because [your] sins are forgiven you for his name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked [one]. I write to you, little children, because ye have known the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have written to you, fathers, because ye have known him [that is] from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked [one].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any one love the world, the love of the Father is not in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because all that [is] in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the world is passing, and its lust, but he that does the will of God abides for eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, it is [the] last hour, and, according as ye have heard that antichrist comes, even now there have come many antichrists, whence we know that it is [the] last hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They went out from among us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have surely remained with us, but that they might be made manifest that none are of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And *ye* have [the] unction from the holy [one], and ye know all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not written to you because ye do not know the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? *He* is the antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whoever denies the Son has not the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As for *you* let that which ye have heard from the beginning abide in you: if what ye have heard from the beginning abides in you, *ye* also shall abide in the Son and in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this is the promise which *he* has promised us, life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>These things have I written to you concerning those who lead you astray:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and *yourselves*, the unction which ye have received from him abides in you, and ye have not need that any one should teach you; but as the same unction teaches you as to all things, and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, children, abide in him, that if he be manifested we may have boldness, and not be put to shame from before him at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If ye know that he is righteous, know that every one who practises righteousness is begotten of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
