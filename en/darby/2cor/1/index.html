Or what I purpose, do I purpose according to flesh, that there should be with me yea yea, and nay nay?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now God [is] faithful, that our word to you is not yea and nay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, he who has been preached by us among you (by me and Silvanus and Timotheus), did not become yea and nay, but yea *is* in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For whatever promises of God [there are], in him is the yea, and in him the amen, for glory to God by us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now he that establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, [is] God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who also has sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I call God to witness upon my soul that to spare you I have not yet come to Corinth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not that we rule over your faith, but are fellow-workmen of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
