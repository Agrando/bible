If any one has confidence in himself that he is of Christ, let him think this again in himself, that even as he [is] of Christ, so also [are] we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For and if I should boast even somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord has given [to us] for building up and not for your overthrowing, I shall not be put to shame;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that I may not seem as if I was frightening you by letters:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>because his letters, he says, [are] weighty and strong, but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by letters [when] absent, such also present in deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not intelligent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now *we* will not boast out of measure, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure has apportioned to us, to reach to you also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we do not, as not reaching to you, overstretch ourselves, (for we have come to you also in the glad tidings of the Christ;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>not boasting out of measure in other people's labours, but having hope, your faith increasing, to be enlarged amongst you, according to our rule, yet more abundantly</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to announce the glad tidings to that [which is] beyond you, not to be boasting in another's rule of things made ready to hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that boasts, let him boast in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For not *he* that commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
