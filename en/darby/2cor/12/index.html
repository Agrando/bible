Most gladly therefore will I rather boast in my weaknesses, that the power of the Christ may dwell upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in insults, in necessities, in persecutions, in straits, for Christ: for when I am weak, then I am powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become a fool; *ye* have compelled me; for *I* ought to have been commended by you; for I have been nothing behind those who were in surpassing degree apostles, if also I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The signs indeed of the apostle were wrought among you in all endurance, signs, and wonders, and works of power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For in what is it that ye have been inferior to the other assemblies, unless that I myself have not been in laziness a charge upon you? Forgive me this injury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be in laziness a charge; for I do not seek yours, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now *I* shall most gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls, if even in abundantly loving you I should be less loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But be it so. *I* did not burden you, but being crafty I took you by guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I make gain of you by any of those whom I have sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I begged Titus, and sent the brother with [him]: did Titus at all make gain of you? have we not walked in the same spirit? [have we] not in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye have long been supposing that we excuse ourselves to you: we speak before God in Christ; and all things, beloved, for your building up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear lest perhaps coming I find you not such as I wish, and that *I* be found by you such as ye do not wish: lest [there might be] strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, evil speakings, whisperings, puffings up, disturbances;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>lest my God should humble me as to you when I come again, and that I shall grieve over many of those who have sinned before, and have not repented as to the uncleanness and fornication and licentiousness which they have practised.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
