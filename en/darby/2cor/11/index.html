God knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, I will also do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those wishing [for] an opportunity, that wherein they boast they may be found even as we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And [it is] not wonderful, for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Again I say, Let not any one think me to be a fool; but if otherwise, receive me then even as a fool, that *I* also may boast myself some little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I speak I do not speak according to [the] Lord, but as in folly, in this confidence of boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since many boast according to flesh, *I* also will boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For ye bear fools readily, being wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ye bear if any one bring you into bondage, if any one devour [you], if any one get [your money], if any one exalt himself, if any one beat you on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak as to dishonour, as though *we* had been weak; but wherein any one is daring, (I speak in folly,) *I* also am daring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? *I* also. Are they Israelites? *I* also. Are they seed of Abraham? *I* also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as being beside myself) *I* above measure [so]; in labours exceedingly abundant, in stripes to excess, in prisons exceedingly abundant, in deaths oft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From the Jews five times have I received forty [stripes], save one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thrice have I been scourged, once I have been stoned, three times I have suffered shipwreck, a night and day I passed in the deep:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from [my own] race, in perils from [the] nations, in perils in [the] city, in perils in [the] desert, in perils on [the] sea, in perils among false brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>in labour and toil, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides those things that are without, the crowd [of cares] pressing on me daily, the burden of all the assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I burn not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If it is needful to boast, I will boast in the things which concern my infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus knows he who is blessed for ever that I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the ethnarch of Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes shut up, wishing to take me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
