They have forsaken Jehovah; they have despised the Holy One of Israel; they are turned away backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why should ye be smitten any more? ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in him; wounds, and weals, and open sores: they have not been dressed, nor bound up, nor mollified with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers eat it up in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left, as a booth in a vineyard, as a night-lodge in a cucumber-garden, as a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Unless Jehovah of hosts had left us a very small residue, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of Jehovah, rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? saith Jehovah. I am sated with burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and in the blood of bullocks, and of lambs, and of he-goats I take no pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this from your hand to tread my courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain oblations! Incense is an abomination unto me, new moon and sabbath, the calling of convocations wickedness and the solemn meeting I cannot bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your new moons and your set feasts my soul hateth: they are a burden to me; I am wearied of bearing [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>learn to do well: seek judgment, gladden the oppressed, do justice to the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now, let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye be willing and hearken, ye shall eat the good of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How is the faithful city become a harlot! It was full of judgment; righteousness used to lodge in it, but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine is mixed with water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth presents, and hunteth after rewards; they judge not the fatherless, and the cause of the widow cometh not unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: Ah! I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and will thoroughly purge away thy dross, and take away all thine alloy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning. Afterwards thou shalt be called, Town of righteousness, Faithful city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and they that return of her with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the ruin of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall be] together; and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths that ye have desired, and ye shall blush for the gardens that ye have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong shall be for tow, and his work a spark; and they shall both burn together, and there shall be none to quench [them].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
