To whom will ye flee for help, and where will ye leave your glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They can but crouch under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ah! the Assyrian! the rod of mine anger! and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge; to take the spoil, and to seize the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; for it is in his heart to extirpate and cut off nations not a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he saith, Are not my princes all kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is not Calno as Karkemish?
