Have I not caused thee to hear from that time, and have declared it? and ye are my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no Rock: I know not any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They that form a graven image are all of them vanity, and their delectable things are of no profit; and they are their own witnesses: they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who hath formed a God, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed; and the workmen are but men. Let them all be gathered together, let them stand up: they shall fear, they shall be ashamed together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The iron-smith [hath] a chisel, and he worketh in the coals, and he fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with his strong arm; but he is hungry, and his strength faileth; he hath not drunk water, and he is faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The worker in wood stretcheth out a line; he marketh it out with red chalk; he formeth it with sharp tools, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of man: that it may remain in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he heweth him down cedars, he taketh also a holm-oak and a terebinth he chooseth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth a pine, and the rain maketh [it] grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it shall be for a man to burn, and he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; he kindleth it also, and baketh bread; he maketh also a God, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh, he roasteth roast, and is satisfied; yea, he is warm, and saith, Aha, I am become warm, I have seen the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And with the remainder thereof he maketh a God, his graven image; he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me, for thou art my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They have no knowledge, and understand not; for he hath plastered their eyes, that they may not see; and their hearts, that they may not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And none taketh it to heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire, and have also baked bread upon the coals thereof, I have roasted flesh, and eaten [it], and with the rest thereof shall I make an abomination? shall I bow down to a block of wood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He feedeth on ashes; a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Remember these things, O Jacob, and Israel, for thou art my servant; I have formed thee: thou art my servant, Israel; thou shalt not be forgotten of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sing, ye heavens; for Jehovah hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth; break forth into singing, ye mountains, the forest, and every tree therein!
