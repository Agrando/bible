Is it not thou that hath hewn Rahab in pieces, [and] pierced the monster?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Is it not thou that dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; that made the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come to Zion with singing; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I, [even] I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou fearest a man that shall die, and the son of man that shall become as grass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and forgettest Jehovah thy Maker, who hath stretched out the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and thou art afraid continually all the day because of the fury of the oppressor, when he prepareth to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He that is bowed down shall speedily be loosed, and he shall not die in the pit, nor shall his bread fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I am Jehovah thy God, who raiseth the sea, so that its waves roar: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have put my words in thy mouth, and covered thee with the shadow of my hand, to plant the heavens, and to lay the foundations of the earth, and to say unto Zion, Thou art my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Arouse thyself, arouse thyself, stand up, Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his fury. Thou hast drunk, hast drained out the goblet-cup of bewilderment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>there is none to guide her among all the children that she hath brought forth; neither is there any to take her by the hand of all the children that she hath brought up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>These two [things] are come unto thee; who will bemoan thee? desolation and destruction, and famine and sword: how shall I comfort thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thy children have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an oryx in a net: they are full of the fury of Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>thus saith thy Lord, Jehovah, and thy God, who pleadeth the cause of his people, Behold, I take out of thy hand the cup of bewilderment, the goblet-cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; who have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street to them that went over.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
