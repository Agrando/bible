These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith Jehovah, who have burned incense upon the mountains, and outraged me upon the hills; and I will measure their former work into their bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus saith Jehovah: As the new wine is found in the cluster, and it is said, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it; so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah a possessor of my mountains; and mine elect shall possess it, and my servants shall dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the Sharon shall be a fold for flocks, and the valley of Achor a couching-place of the herds, for my people that have sought me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But ye who forsake Jehovah, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Gad, and fill up mixed wine unto Meni:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will even assign you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down in the slaughter; because I called, and ye did not answer, I spoke, and ye did not hear; but ye did what was evil in mine eyes, and chose that wherein I delight not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, my servants shall eat, and *ye* shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, and *ye* shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, and *ye* shall be ashamed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>behold, my servants shall sing aloud for gladness of heart, and *ye* shall cry out for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto mine elect; for the Lord Jehovah will slay thee, and will call his servants by another name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so that he who blesseth himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the land shall swear by the God of truth: because the former troubles shall be forgotten, and because they shall be hidden from mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create. For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will rejoice over Jerusalem, and will joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There shall be no more thenceforth an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not completed his days; for the youth shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>they shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror; for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
