Against whom do ye make a wide mouth, [and] draw out the tongue? Are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Among the smooth [stones] of the torrent is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured out a drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be comforted myself as to these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither didst thou go up to offer sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for apart from me, thou hast uncovered thyself, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and hast made agreement with them; thou lovedst their bed, thou sawest their nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst multiply thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers afar off, and didst debase thyself unto Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou wast wearied by the multitude of thy ways; [but] thou saidst not, It is of no avail. Thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not sick [of it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor taken it to heart? Have not I even of long time held my peace, and thou fearest me not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; and they shall not profit thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When thou criest, let them that are gathered by thee deliver thee! But a wind shall carry them all away, a breath shall take them; but he that putteth his trust in me shall inherit the land, and possess my holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it shall be said, Cast up, cast up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-blocks out of the way of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, and whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy [place], and with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit would fail before me, and the souls [which] I have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on backslidingly in the way of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have seen his ways, and will heal him; and I will lead him, and will restore comforts unto him and to those of his that mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I create the fruit of the lips: peace, peace to him [that is] afar off, and to him [that is] nigh, saith Jehovah; and I will heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot rest, and whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
