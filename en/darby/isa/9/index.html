The zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord sent a word unto Jacob, and it lighteth upon Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people shall know [it], Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and stoutness of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamore trees are cut down, but we will replace them with cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah will set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and arm his enemies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the Syrians on the east, and the Philistines on the west; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, and they do not seek Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>the ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the guides of this people mislead [them]; and they that are guided by them are swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the Lord will not rejoice in their young men, neither will he have mercy on their fatherless and on their widows; for every one is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For wickedness burneth as a fire: it devoureth briars and thorns, and kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they go rolling up like a pillar of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burned up, and the people is as fuel for fire: a man spareth not his brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he snatcheth on the right hand, and is hungry, and eateth on the left hand; and they are not satisfied. They eat every man the flesh of his own arm:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Manasseh, Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh; [and] they together are against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
