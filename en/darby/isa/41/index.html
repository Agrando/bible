He gave the nations before him, and caused him to have dominion over kings; he gave them as dust to his sword, as driven stubble to his bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He pursued them, he passed on in safety, by a way he had never come with his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who hath wrought and done [it], calling the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, the first; and with the last, I [am] HE.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The isles saw [it], and feared; the ends of the earth trembled: they drew near, and came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They helped every one his neighbour, and [each] said to his brother, Take courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the artizan encouraged the founder, he that smootheth [with] the hammer him that smiteth on the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good; and he fasteneth it with nails, that it be not moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham, my friend</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called from the extremities thereof, and to whom I said, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee and not rejected thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear not, for I [am] with thee; be not dismayed, for I [am] thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Lo, all that are incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded; they that strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them them that contend with thee; they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I, Jehovah, thy God, hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Fear not, thou worm Jacob, ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith Jehovah, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, I have made of thee a new sharp threshing instrument having double teeth: thou shalt thresh and beat small the mountains, and shalt make the hills as chaff;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The afflicted and the needy seek water, and there is none; their tongue faileth for thirst: I, Jehovah, will answer them, [I], the God of Israel, will not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into water-springs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will give in the wilderness the cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oleaster; I will set in the desert the cypress, pine, and box-tree together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Produce your cause, saith Jehovah; bring forward your arguments, saith the King of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let them bring them forward, and declare to us what shall happen: shew the former things, what they are, that we may give attention to them, and know the end of them; or let us hear things to come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>declare the things that are to happen hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods; yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be astonished, and behold it together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, ye are less than nothing, and your work is of nought; an abomination is he that chooseth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come, from the rising of the sun, he who will call upon my name; and he shall come upon princes as on mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Who hath declared [it] from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, [It is] right?
