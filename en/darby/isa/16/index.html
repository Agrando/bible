For the extortioner is at an end, the wasting hath ceased, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a throne shall be established in mercy: and in the tent of David there shall sit upon it, in truth, one judging and seeking justice and hastening righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have heard of the arrogance of Moab, [he is] very proud, of his pride, and his arrogance, and his wrath: his pratings are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab; every one of them shall howl. For the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn, verily afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the fields of Heshbon languish, the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down its choice plants: they reached unto Jaazer, they wandered [through] the wilderness; its shoots stretched out, they went beyond the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jaazer for the vine of Sibmah; with my tears will I water thee, Heshbon, and Elealeh, for a cry is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And joy and gladness is taken away out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there is no singing, neither is there shouting: the treaders tread out no wine in the presses, I have made the cry [of the winepress] to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore my bowels sound like a harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirheres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it shall come to pass, when Moab shall appear, shall weary himself on the high place, and enter into his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is the word which Jehovah hath spoken from of old concerning Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now Jehovah speaketh saying, Within three years, as the years of a hired servant, and the glory of Moab shall be brought to nothing, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be small, few, of no account.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
