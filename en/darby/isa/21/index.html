As whirlwinds in the south pass through, so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A grievous vision is declared unto me: the treacherous dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, Elam! besiege, Media! All the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore are my loins filled with pain; anguish hath taken hold upon me, as the anguish of a woman in travail: I am bowed down so as not to hear, I am dismayed so as not to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart panteth, horror affrighteth me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into trembling unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Prepare the table, appoint the watch; eat, drink: arise, ye princes, anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus hath the Lord said unto me: Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he saw chariots, horsemen by pairs, a chariot with asses, a chariot with camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he cried [as] a lion, Lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And behold, there cometh a chariot of men; horsemen by pairs. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O my threshing, and the corn of my floor! What I have heard of Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire; return, come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden against Arabia. In the forest of Arabia shall ye lodge, [ye] caravans of Dedanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Bring ye water to meet the thirsty! The inhabitants of the land of Tema come forth with their bread for him that fleeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they flee from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thus hath the Lord said unto me: Within a year, according to the years of a hired servant, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, shall be diminished: for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
