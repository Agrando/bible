And he saith, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the comeliness thereof as the flower of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, for the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God abideth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O Zion, that bringest glad tidings, get thee up into a high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest glad tidings, lift up thy voice with strength: lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come with might, and his arm shall rule for him; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompence before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He will feed his flock like a shepherd: he will gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom; he will gently lead those that give suck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out the heavens with [his] span, and grasped the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in a balance, and the hills in scales?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah, and, [as] his counsellor, hath taught him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With whom took he counsel, and [who] gave him intelligence, and instructed him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed him the way of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, the nations are esteemed as a drop of the bucket, and as the fine dust on the scales; behold, he taketh up the isles as an atom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the nations are as nothing before him; they are esteemed by him less than a cipher, and vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will ye liken God? and what likeness will ye compare unto him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The workman casteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains [for it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that is impoverished, so that he hath no offering, chooseth a tree that doth not rot; he seeketh unto him a skilled workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do ye not know? Have ye not heard? Hath it not been told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood the foundation of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[It is] he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a gauze curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that bringeth the princes to nothing, that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Scarcely are they planted, scarcely are they sown, scarcely hath their stock taken root in the earth, but he also bloweth upon them and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your eyes on high, and see! Who hath created these things, bringing out their host by number? He calleth them all by name; through the greatness of his might and strength of power, not one faileth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why sayest thou, Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah, and my right is passed away from my God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Dost thou not know, hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not nor tireth? There is no searching of his understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even the youths shall faint and shall tire, and the young men shall stumble and fall;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but they that wait upon Jehovah shall renew [their] strength: they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not tire; they shall walk, and not faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
