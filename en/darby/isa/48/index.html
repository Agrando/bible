I have caused thee to hear new things from this time, and things hidden, and that thou knewest not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>they are created now, and not long ago; and before this day thou hast not heard them, lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, thou heardest not, yea, thou knewest not, yea, from of old thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldest ever deal treacherously, and thou wast called a transgressor from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For my name's sake I will defer mine anger, and [for] my praise will I refrain as to thee, that I cut thee not off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do [it]; for how should [my name] be profaned? and I will not give my glory unto another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hearken unto me, Jacob, and [thou] Israel, my called. I [am] HE; I, the first, and I, the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread abroad the heavens: I call unto them, they stand up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All ye, gather yourselves together, and hear: which among them hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah hath loved shall execute his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, [even] I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and his way shall be prosperous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come near unto me, hear ye this: I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I; and now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I [am] Jehovah thy God, who teacheth thee for [thy] profit, who leadeth thee in the way that thou shouldest go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! Then would thy peace have been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and thy seed would have been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof: their name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go ye forth from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing; declare, cause this to be heard, utter it to the end of the earth; say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; yea, he clave the rock, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace, saith Jehovah, unto the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
