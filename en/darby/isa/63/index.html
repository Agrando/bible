I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Wherefore is redness in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winevat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples not a man was with me; and I have trodden them in mine anger, and trampled them in my fury; and their blood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all mine apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed had come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there was none to uphold: and mine own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I have trodden down the peoples in mine anger, and made them drunk in my fury; and their blood have I brought down to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I will record the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah, the praises of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed upon us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he hath bestowed upon them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, They are indeed my people, children that will not lie; and he became their Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bore them and carried them all the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But they rebelled and grieved his holy Spirit: and he turned to be their enemy; himself, he fought against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people: Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock?
