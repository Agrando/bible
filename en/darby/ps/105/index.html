make known his acts among the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him; meditate upon all his wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Seek Jehovah and his strength, seek his face continually;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember his wondrous works which he hath done, his miracles and the judgments of his mouth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He, Jehovah, is our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He is ever mindful of his covenant, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, unto Israel for an everlasting covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were a few men in number, of small account, and strangers in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He suffered no man to oppress them, and reproved kings for their sakes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>[Saying,] Touch not mine anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole staff of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent a man before them: Joseph was sold for a bondman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They afflicted his feet with fetters; his soul came into irons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Until the time when what he said came about: the word of Jehovah tried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king sent and loosed him the ruler of peoples and let him go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He made him lord of his house, and ruler over all his possessions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To bind his princes at his pleasure, and teach his elders wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Israel came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he made his people exceeding fruitful, and made them mightier than their oppressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He sent Moses his servant, [and] Aaron whom he had chosen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They set his signs among them, and miracles in the land of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He turned their waters into blood, and caused their fish to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Their land swarmed with frogs, in the chambers of their kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He spoke, and there came dog-flies, [and] gnats in all their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He gave them hail for rain, [and] flaming fire in their land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he smote their vines and their fig-trees, and broke the trees of their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He spoke, and the locust came, and the cankerworm, even without number;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they devoured every herb in their land, and ate up the fruit of their ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he smote every firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their vigour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he brought them forth with silver and gold;

they ran in the dry places [like] a river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he remembered his holy word, [and] Abraham his servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he brought forth his people with gladness, his chosen with rejoicing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he gave them the lands of the nations, and they took possession of the labour of the peoples:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>That they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws.
