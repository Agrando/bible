dwell in the land, and feed on faithfulness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and delight thyself in Jehovah, and he will give thee the desires of thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Commit thy way unto Jehovah, and rely upon him: he will bring [it] to pass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and he will bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Rest in Jehovah, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him that prospereth in his way, because of the man that bringeth mischievous devices to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; fret not thyself: it [would be] only to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evil-doers shall be cut off; but those that wait on Jehovah, they shall possess the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For yet a little while, and the wicked is not; and thou considerest his place, but he is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the meek shall possess the land, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of prosperity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked plotteth against the righteous, and gnasheth his teeth against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Lord laugheth at him; for he seeth that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the afflicted and needy, to slay those that are upright in [the] way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The little that the righteous hath is better than the abundance of many wicked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the arms of the wicked shall be broken, but Jehovah upholdeth the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jehovah knoweth the days of the perfect; and their inheritance shall be for ever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>they shall not be ashamed in the time of evil, and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of Jehovah shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume, like smoke shall they consume away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again; but the righteous is gracious and giveth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for those blessed of him shall possess the land, and they that are cursed of him shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The steps of a man are established by Jehovah, and he delighteth in his way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for Jehovah upholdeth his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and now am old, and I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>all the day he is gracious and lendeth, and his seed shall be a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Depart from evil, and do good, and dwell for evermore;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for Jehovah loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints: They are preserved for ever; but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous shall possess the land, and dwell therein for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the righteous proffereth wisdom, and his tongue speaketh judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the law of his God is in his heart; his goings shall not slide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to possess the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading like a green tree in its native soil:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>but he passed away, and behold, he was not; and I sought him, but he was not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mark the perfect, and behold the upright, for the end of [that] man is peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but the transgressors shall be destroyed together; the future of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous is of Jehovah: he is their strength in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jehovah will help them and deliver them: he will deliver them from the wicked, and save them; for they trust in him.</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="41">41</a></span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
