Give ye thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; for his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah? [who] can shew forth all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed are they that keep justice, [and] he that doeth righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O Jehovah, with [thy] favour toward thy people; visit me with thy salvation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen ones, that I may rejoice in the joy of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers in Egypt considered not thy wondrous works; they remembered not the multitude of thy loving-kindnesses; but they rebelled at the sea, at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make known his might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up; and he led them through the deeps as through a wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saved them from the hand of him that hated [them], and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters covered their oppressors: there was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they envied Moses in the camp, [and] Aaron, the saint of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And fire was kindled in their company; a flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb, and did homage to a molten image;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot God their Saviour, who had done great things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, terrible things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses, his chosen, stood before him in the breach, to turn away his fury, lest he should destroy [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they despised the pleasant land; they believed not his word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But murmured in their tents: they hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he lifted up his hand to them, that he would make them fall in the wilderness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And that he would make their seed fall among the nations, and disperse them through the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they joined themselves unto Baal-Peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they provoked [him] to anger with their doings; and a plague broke out among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then stood up Phinehas and executed judgment, and the plague was stayed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, from generation to generation, for evermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they moved him to wrath at the waters of Meribah, and it went ill with Moses on their account;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For they provoked his spirit, so that he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the peoples, as Jehovah commanded them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But they mingled with the nations, and learned their works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they served their idols; and they were a snare unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they were defiled with their works, and went a-whoring in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then was the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he abhorred his inheritance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Often did he deliver them; but as for them they provoked [him] by their counsel, and they were brought low by their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he caused them to find compassion of all those that had carried them captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, Jehovah our God, and gather us from among the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, [and] to triumph in thy praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, from eternity and to eternity! And let all the people say, Amen! Hallelujah!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
