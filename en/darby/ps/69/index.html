Upon Shoshannim. [A Psalm] of David.} Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto [my] soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing; I am come into the depths of waters, and the flood overfloweth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am weary with my crying, my throat is parched; mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou, O God, knowest my foolishness, and my trespasses are not hidden from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not them that wait on thee, Lord, Jehovah of hosts, be ashamed through me; let not those that seek thee be confounded through me, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; confusion hath covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the zeal of thy house hath devoured me, and the reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I wept, my soul was fasting: that also was to my reproach;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I made sackcloth my garment: then I became a proverb to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They that sit in the gate talk of me, and [I am] the song of the drunkards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, Jehovah, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of thy loving-kindness answer me, according to the truth of thy salvation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire, let me not sink; let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the depths of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let not the flood of waters overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up; and let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Answer me, O Jehovah; for thy loving-kindness is good: according to the abundance of thy tender mercies, turn toward me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am in trouble: answer me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Draw nigh unto my soul, be its redeemer; ransom me because of mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>*Thou* knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am overwhelmed: and I looked for sympathy, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let their table become a snare before them, and their very welfare a trap;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not, and make their loins continually to shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let the fierceness of thine anger take hold of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let their habitation be desolate; let there be no dweller in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they persecute him whom *thou* hast smitten, and they talk for the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I am afflicted and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me secure on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it shall please Jehovah more than an ox, a bullock with horns and cloven hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The meek shall see it, they shall be glad; ye that seek God, your heart shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For Jehovah heareth the needy, and despiseth not his prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let heavens and earth praise him; the seas, and everything that moveth therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah; and they shall dwell there, and possess it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the seed of his servants shall inherit it, and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
