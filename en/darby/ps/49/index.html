Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm.} Hear this, all ye peoples; give ear, all inhabitants of the world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Both men of low and men of high degree, rich and poor alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will incline mine ear to a parable, I will open my riddle upon the harp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore should I fear in the days of adversity, [when] the iniquity of my supplanters encompasseth me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They depend upon their wealth, and boast themselves in the abundance of their riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>None can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(For the redemption of their soul is costly, and must be given up for ever,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That he should still live perpetually, [and] not see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he seeth that wise men die; all alike, the fool and the brutish perish, and they leave their wealth to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Their inward thought is, that their houses are for ever, their dwelling-places from generation to generation: they call the lands after their own names.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Nevertheless, man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This their way is their folly, yet they that come after them delight in their sayings. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Like sheep are they laid in Sheol: Death feedeth on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their comeliness shall be for Sheol to consume, that there be no habitation for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol: for he will receive me. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not afraid when a man becometh rich, when the glory of his house is increased:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For when he dieth, he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Though he blessed his soul in his lifetime, and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It shall go to the generation of his fathers: they shall never see light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
