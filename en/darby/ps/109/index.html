Of David. A Psalm.} O God of my praise, be not silent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For the mouth of the wicked [man] and the mouth of deceit are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And with words of hatred have they encompassed me; and they fight against me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For my love they are mine adversaries; but I [give myself unto] prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Set a wicked [man] over him, and let [the] adversary stand at his right hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he shall be judged, let him go out guilty, and let his prayer become sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let his days be few, let another take his office;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let his sons be fatherless, and his wife a widow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let his sons be vagabonds and beg, and let them seek [their bread] far from their desolate places;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the usurer cast the net over all that he hath, and let strangers despoil his labour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let there be none to extend kindness unto him, neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let his posterity be cut off; in the generation following let their name be blotted out:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with Jehovah, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be before Jehovah continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because he remembered not to shew kindness, but persecuted the afflicted and needy man, and the broken in heart, to slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he loved cursing; so let it come unto him. And he delighted not in blessing; and let it be far from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he clothed himself with cursing like his vestment; so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let it be unto him as a garment with which he covereth himself, and for a girdle wherewith he is constantly girded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from Jehovah, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But do *thou* for me, Jehovah, Lord, for thy name's sake; because thy loving-kindness is good, deliver me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I am afflicted and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am gone like a shadow when it lengtheneth; I am tossed about like the locust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My knees are failing through fasting, and my flesh hath lost its fatness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I am become a reproach unto them; [when] they look upon me they shake their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Help me, Jehovah my God; save me according to thy loving-kindness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That they may know that this is thy hand; that *thou*, Jehovah, hast done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let *them* curse, but bless *thou*; when they rise up, let them be ashamed, and let thy servant rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let mine adversaries be clothed with confusion, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will greatly celebrate Jehovah with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he standeth at the right hand of the needy, to save him from those that judge his soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
