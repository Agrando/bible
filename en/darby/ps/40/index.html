Of David. A Psalm.} I waited patiently for Jehovah; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he brought me up out of the pit of destruction, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock; he hath established my goings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he hath put a new song in my mouth, praise unto our God. Many shall see it, and fear, and shall confide in Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed is the man that hath made Jehovah his confidence, and turneth not to the proud, and to such as turn aside to lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou, O Jehovah my God, hast multiplied thy marvellous works, and thy thoughts toward us: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee; would I declare and speak [them], they are more than can be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire: ears hast thou prepared me. Burnt-offering and sin-offering hast thou not demanded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said I, Behold, I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>To do thy good pleasure, my God, is my delight, and thy law is within my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have published righteousness in the great congregation: behold, I have not withheld my lips, Jehovah, *thou* knowest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have not hidden thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy loving-kindness and thy truth from the great congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Withhold not thou, Jehovah, thy tender mercies from me; let thy loving-kindness and thy truth continually preserve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head: and my heart hath failed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be pleased, O Jehovah, to deliver me; Jehovah, make haste to my help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be turned backward and confounded that take pleasure in mine adversity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be desolate, because of their shame, that say unto me, Aha!
