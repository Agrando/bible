Of Asaph.} Give ear, O my people, to my law; incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter riddles from of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not hide [them] from their sons, shewing forth to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength, and his marvellous works which he hath done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That the generation to come might know [them], the children that should be born; that they might rise up and tell [them] to their children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but observe his commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that prepared not their heart, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The sons of Ephraim, armed bowmen, turned back in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And forgot his doings, and his marvellous works which he had shewn them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In the sight of their fathers had he done wonders, in the land of Egypt, the field of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; and made the waters to stand as a heap;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he led them with a cloud in the daytime, and all the night with the light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He clave rocks in the wilderness, and gave [them] drink as out of the depths, abundantly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought streams out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet they still went on sinning against him, provoking the Most High in the desert;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they tempted God in their heart, by asking meat for their lust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they spoke against God: they said, Is God able to prepare a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, he smote the rock, and waters gushed out, and streams overflowed; is he able to give bread also, or provide flesh for his people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; and fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also went up against Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because they believed not in God, and confided not in his salvation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of the heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the corn of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man did eat the bread of the mighty; he sent them provision to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused the east wind to rise in the heavens, and by his strength he brought the south wind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he rained flesh upon them as dust, and feathered fowl as the sand of the seas,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they did eat, and were well filled; for that they lusted after, he brought to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They were not alienated from their lust, their meat was yet in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the anger of God went up against them; and he slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this, they sinned still, and believed not in his marvellous works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he consumed their days in vanity, and their years in terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he slew them, then they sought him, and returned and sought early after God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they remembered that God was their rock, and God, the Most High, their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not firm toward him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he was merciful: he forgave the iniquity, and destroyed [them] not; but many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his fury:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he remembered that they were flesh, a breath that passeth away and cometh not again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they turned again and tempted God, and grieved the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They remembered not his hand, the day when he delivered them from the oppressor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How he set his signs in Egypt, and his miracles in the field of Zoan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And turned their rivers into blood, and their streams, that they could not drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent dog-flies among them, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he gave their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamore trees with hail-stones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he delivered up their cattle to the hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and distress, a mission of angels of woes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a way for his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the first-fruits of their vigour in the tents of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And he led them safely, so that they were without fear; and the sea covered their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he brought them to his holy border, this mountain, which his right hand purchased;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And he drove out the nations before them, and allotted them for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But they tempted and provoked God, the Most High, and kept not his testimonies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they drew back and dealt treacherously like their fathers: they turned like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>God heard, and was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he forsook the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent where he had dwelt among men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And gave his strength into captivity, and his glory into the hand of the oppressor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And delivered up his people unto the sword, and was very wroth with his inheritance:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not praised in [nuptial] song;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the Lord awoke as one out of sleep, like a mighty man that shouteth aloud by reason of wine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And he smote his adversaries in the hinder part, and put them to everlasting reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And he rejected the tent of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And he built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth which he hath founded for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And he chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>From following the suckling-ewes, he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And he fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and led them by the skilfulness of his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
