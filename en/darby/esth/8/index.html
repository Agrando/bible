And Mordecai came before the king; for Esther had told what he was to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device which he had devised against the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. And Esther arose and stood before the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said, If it please the king and if I have found grace before him, and the thing seem right to the king, and I be pleasing in his sight, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews that are in all the king's provinces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For how shall I endure to see the evil that shall befall my people? and how shall I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And king Ahasuerus said to queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he stretched forth his hand against the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Write ye then for the Jews as seems good to you, in the king's name, and seal [it] with the king's ring.
