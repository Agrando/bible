And is it gain [to him] that thou makest thy ways perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will he reason with thee for fear of thee? Will he enter with thee into judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities without end?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thou hast taken a pledge of thy brother for nought, and stripped off the clothing of the naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou hast not given water to the fainting to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the powerful man, he had the land; and the man of high rank dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Widows hast thou sent empty away, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Or darkness, that thou canst not see, and floods of waters cover thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not God in the height of the heavens? And behold the summit of the stars: how exalted are they!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And thou sayest, What doth God know? will he judge through the dark cloud?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh on the vault of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Dost thou mark the ancient path which wicked men have trodden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were carried off before the time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Who said unto God, Depart from us! and what could the Almighty do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet he filled their houses with good. But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The righteous see it, and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Is not he who rose against us destroyed, and doth not the fire consume his residue?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Reconcile thyself now with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Receive, I pray thee, instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up.
