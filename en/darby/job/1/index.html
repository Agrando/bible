Thus did Job continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah; and Satan came also among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah said to Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah said to Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God and abstaineth from evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Satan answered Jehovah and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is spread abroad in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath, [and see] if he will not curse thee to thy face!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and [they of] Sheba fell [upon them] and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels and took them, and the servants have they smitten with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and behold, there came a great wind from over the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they died; and I only am escaped, alone, to tell thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Job rose up, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job sinned not, nor ascribed anything unseemly to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
