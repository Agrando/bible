The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then came in all the king's wise men, but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his nobles were confounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The queen, by reason of the words of the king and his nobles, came into the banquet-house. The queen spoke and said, O king, live for ever! let not thy thoughts trouble thee, neither let thy countenance be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father, light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods was found in him; and the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, [even] the king thy father, made him master of the scribes, magicians, Chaldeans, [and] astrologers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and solving of problems, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. Now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then was Daniel brought in before the king. The king spoke and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and [that] light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now the wise men, the magicians, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof; but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I have heard of thee, that thou canst give interpretations, and solve problems. Now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with purple, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet will I read the writing to the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O thou king, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom, and greatness, and glory, and majesty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and for the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew, and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he exalted, and whom he would he humbled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when his heart was lifted up, and his spirit hardened unto presumption, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom, and they took his glory from him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses; they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the Most High God ruleth over the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou, Belshazzar, his son, hast not humbled thy heart, although thou knewest all this;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of the heavens; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy nobles, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then from before him was sent the part of the hand, and this writing hath been written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this is the writing that is written: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE, God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>TEKEL, Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>PERES, Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple, and [put] a chain of gold about his neck, and made proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Darius the Mede received the kingdom, [being] about sixty-two years old.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
