And he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, [that] shall arise out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the saints of the most high [places] shall receive the kingdom, and they shall possess the kingdom for ever, even to the ages of ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I desired to know the certainty concerning the fourth beast, which was different from them all, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the rest with its feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and concerning the ten horns that were in its head, and the other that came up, and before which three fell: even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth speaking great things, and whose look was more imposing than its fellows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I beheld, and that horn made war with the saints, and prevailed over them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most high [places]; and the appointed time arrived, and the saints possessed the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said thus: The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon the earth, which shall be different from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as to the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall arise ten kings; and another shall arise after them; and he shall be different from the former, and he shall subdue three kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most high [places], and think to change seasons and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and a half time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heavens, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high [places]. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So far is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me; but I kept the matter in my heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
