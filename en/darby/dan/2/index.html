Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Daniel went in, and requested of the king that he would give him time, that he might shew the king the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that they would desire mercies of the God of the heavens concerning this secret; that Daniel and his companions should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever; For wisdom and might are his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it is he that changeth times and seasons; He deposeth kings, and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom to the wise, And knowledge to them that know understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is he that revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I thank thee, and I praise thee, O God of my fathers, Who hast given me wisdom and might, And hast made known unto me already what we desired of thee; For thou hast made known unto us the king's matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him: Destroy not the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus unto him: I have found a man of the sons of the captivity of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The king answered and said unto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream that I have seen, and its interpretation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, The secret that the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the magicians, the scribes, the astrologers, shew unto the king;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but there is a God in the heavens, who revealeth secrets, and maketh known to king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be at the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>as for thee, O king, thy thoughts arose upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter; and he that revealeth secrets hath made known to thee what shall come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as for me, this secret is revealed to me, not by [any] wisdom that I have more than any living, but to the intent that the interpretation should be made known to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thou, O king, sawest, and behold, a great image. This image was mighty and its brightness excellent; it stood before thee, and its appearance was terrible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This image's head was of fine gold, its breast and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Thou sawest till a stone was cut out without hands; and it smote the image upon its feet of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken in pieces together, and they became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors; and the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them. And the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation of it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou, O king, art a king of kings, unto whom the God of the heavens hath given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and wheresoever the children of men, the beasts of the field, and the fowl of the heavens dwell, he hath given them into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all: thou art this head of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee; then another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth everything, and as iron that breaketh all these, so shall it break in pieces and bruise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And [as] the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay, the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly fragile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And whereas thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men; but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron doth not mingle with clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And in the days of these kings shall the God of the heavens set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the sovereignty thereof shall not be left to another people: it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, but itself shall stand for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Forasmuch as thou sawest that a stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold, the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. And the dream is certain, and the interpretation of it sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The king answered Daniel and said, Of a truth it is that your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, because thou wast able to reveal this secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the king made Daniel great, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Daniel requested of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego over the administration of the province of Babylon. And Daniel was in the gate of the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
