And as he spoke this word unto me, I stood trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come because of thy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people at the end of the days: for the vision is yet for [many] days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as he was speaking with me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, one after the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips; and I opened my mouth and spoke, and said unto him that stood before me, My lord, by reason of the vision my pains are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remaineth no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he said, Fear not, man greatly beloved; peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And as he was speaking with me I was strengthened, and I said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? And now I return to fight with the prince of Persia; and when I go forth, behold, the prince of Greece shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>However, I will declare unto thee that which is set down in the scripture of truth; and there is not one that sheweth himself strong with me against these, but Michael your prince.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
