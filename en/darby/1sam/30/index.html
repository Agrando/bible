And Abiathar brought the ephod near to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I pursue after this troop? shall I overtake them? And he said to him, Pursue; for thou shalt assuredly overtake [them] and shalt certainly recover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came to the torrent Besor; and those that were left stayed behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to go over the torrent Besor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and gave him a piece of fig-cake and two raisin-cakes, and he ate, and his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, for three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant of an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We made a raid against the south of the Cherethites, and against what [belongs] to Judah, and against the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this troop? And he said, Swear to me by God, that thou wilt neither put me to death nor deliver me up into the hand of my master, and I will bring thee down to this troop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought him down, and behold, they were spread over the whole land, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day; and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men, who rode upon camels, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken: and David recovered his two wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And there was nothing missed by them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil nor anything that they had taken: David brought all back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove before the other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow David, and whom they had left behind at the torrent Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him; and David drew near to the people and saluted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all the wicked men, and [men] of Belial, of those that had gone with David, answered and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them [aught] of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead [them] away and depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which Jehovah has given us, who has preserved us, and given the troop that came against us into our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And who will hearken to you in this matter? For as his share is that goes down to the battle, so shall his share be that abides by the baggage: they shall share alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was [so] from that day forward; and he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And David came to Ziklag, and he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Jehovah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to those in Bethel, and to those in south Ramoth, and to those in Jattir,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and to those in Aroer, and to those in Siphmoth, and to those in Eshtemoa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and to those in Rachal, and to those in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those in the cities of the Kenites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and to those in Hormah, and to those in Chor-ashan, and to those in Athach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and to those in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men went about.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
