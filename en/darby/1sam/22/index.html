And his brethren and all his father's house heard [it], and they went down thither to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And every one in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one of embittered spirit collected round him; and he became a captain over them; and there were with him about four hundred men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And David went thence to Mizpeh in Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth amongst you, till I know what God will do for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he brought them before the king of Moab; and they abode with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah. Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him. Now Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk upon the height, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, ye Benjaminites: will the son of Jesse give every one of you also fields and vineyards? Will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that informs me when my son has made [a covenant] with the son of Jesse; and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant as a lier-in-wait against me, as at this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he inquired of Jehovah for him, and gave him victuals, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob; and they came all of them to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul said, Hear now, son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Saul said to him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast inquired of God for him, that he should rise against me as a lier-in-wait, as at this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who is so faithful among all thy servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and has access to thy secret council, and is honourable in thy house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Was it to-day that I began to inquire of God for him? be it far from me: let not the king charge anything to his servant, [nor] to all the house of my father; for thy servant knew nothing of all this, less or more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the king said, Thou shalt certainly die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king said to the couriers that stood about him, Turn and put the priests of Jehovah to death; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not inform me. But the servants of the king were not willing to put forth their hand to fall on the priests of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and fell on the priests, and put to death that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, infants and sucklings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abiathar informed David that Saul had slain Jehovah's priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David said to Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul: I am accountable for all the lives of thy father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Abide with me, fear not; for he that seeks my life seeks thy life; for with me thou art in safe keeping.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
