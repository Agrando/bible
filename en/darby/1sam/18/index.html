But David turned away from him twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul was afraid of David, because Jehovah was with him, and had departed from Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David prospered in all his ways; and Jehovah was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul saw that he prospered well, and he stood in awe of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he went out and came in before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said to David, Behold my eldest daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife; only be thou valiant for me, and fight Jehovah's battles. But Saul thought, My hand shall not be upon him, but the hand of the Philistines shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David said to Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, [or] my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Michal Saul's daughter loved David; and they told Saul, and the thing was right in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be upon him. And Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law a second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul commanded his servants, Speak with David secretly, saying, Behold, the king has delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Is it a light thing in your eyes to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner did David speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David: The king does not desire any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And his servants told David these words; and the thing was right in David's sight to be the king's son-in-law. And the days were not expired,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>when David arose and went, he and his men, and smote of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they delivered them in full to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Saul saw and knew that Jehovah was with David; and Michal Saul's daughter loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the princes of the Philistines went forth; and it came to pass, whenever they went forth, that David succeeded better than all the servants of Saul; and his name was much esteemed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
