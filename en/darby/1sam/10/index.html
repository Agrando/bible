Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And a man of that place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he had ended prophesying, he came to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses; and when we saw that they were nowhere, we went to Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul said to his uncle, He told us for certain that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he told him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel called the people together to Jehovah to Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to the children of Israel, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, *I* brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but *ye* have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your troubles, and have said unto him, [Nay,] but a king shalt thou set over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Jehovah by your tribes, and by your thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samuel caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, and the family of Matri was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken. And they sought him, but he was not to be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore they inquired of Jehovah further, Will the man yet come hither? And Jehovah answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they ran and fetched him thence; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom Jehovah has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted and said, May the king live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Samuel told the people the right of the kingdom, and wrote it in the book, and laid it before Jehovah. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and with him went the band, whose hearts God had touched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the children of Belial said, How should this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no gifts. But he was as one deaf.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
