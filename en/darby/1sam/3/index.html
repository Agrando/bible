And the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; a vision was not frequent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli lay in his place (now his eyes began to grow dim, he could not see),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that Jehovah called to Samuel. And he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call: lie down again. And he went and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call, my son: lie down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jehovah called again the third time, Samuel! And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin and make an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he hath known: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to declare the vision to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, What is the word that he has spoken to thee? I pray thee, keep it not back from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel told him all the words, and kept nothing back from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what is good in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
