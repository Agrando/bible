Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I injured? or of whose hand have I received any ransom and blinded mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, and thou hast not injured us, neither hast thou taken aught of any man's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Jehovah is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found aught in my hand! And [the people] said, [He is] witness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Samuel said to the people, [It is] Jehovah who appointed Moses and Aaron, and who brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now stand still, that I may plead with you before Jehovah of all the righteous acts of Jehovah which he did to you and to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Jacob had come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Jehovah, then Jehovah sent Moses and Aaron, and they brought your fathers forth out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they forgot Jehovah their God, and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they cried to Jehovah and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Jehovah, and have served the Baals and the Ashtoreths; and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jehovah sent Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies round about, so that ye dwelt in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said to me, Nay, but a king shall reign over us; when Jehovah your God was your king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now behold, the king whom ye have chosen, whom ye have asked for! and behold, Jehovah has set a king over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If ye fear Jehovah, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and rebel not against the commandment of Jehovah, then both ye and the king also that reigns over you shall continue following Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if ye will not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, and if ye rebel against the commandment of Jehovah, then will the hand of Jehovah be against you, as against your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore stand and see this great thing which Jehovah will do before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call unto Jehovah, and he will send thunder and rain; and ye shall perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of Jehovah in asking for yourselves a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel called to Jehovah; and Jehovah sent thunder and rain that day. And all the people greatly feared Jehovah and Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the people said to Samuel, Pray to Jehovah thy God for thy servants, that we die not; for we have added to all our sins the wickedness to ask for ourselves a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: *ye* have done all this wickedness; yet turn not aside from following Jehovah, and serve Jehovah with all your heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and turn ye not aside; for [it would be] after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Jehovah will not cast away his people for his great name's sake; because it has pleased Jehovah to make you his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Jehovah in ceasing to pray for you; and I will teach you the good and right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only, fear Jehovah, and serve him in truth, with all your heart; for see how great things he has done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if ye do wickedly, ye shall perish, both ye and your king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
