And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of Jehovah, were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass on the day that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but to Hannah he used to give a double portion, for he loved Hannah; but Jehovah had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her adversary provoked her much also, to make her fret, because Jehovah had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And [as] he did so year by year, as often as she went up to the house of Jehovah, she provoked her thus; and she wept and did not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk; (now Eli the priest sat upon the seat by the door-post of the temple of Jehovah;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Jehovah, and wept much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Jehovah of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but wilt give unto thy handmaid a man child, then I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass as she continued praying before Jehovah, that Eli marked her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; and Eli thought she was drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said to her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Take not thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my grief and provocation have I spoken hitherto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition which thou hast asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Let thy bondwoman find grace in thy sight. And the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more [as before].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose up early in the morning and worshipped before Jehovah, and returned and came to their house at Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Jehovah remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bore a son, and called his name Samuel, [saying,] Because I have asked him of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Elkanah her husband, and all his house, went up to sacrifice to Jehovah the yearly sacrifice and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, [I will wait] until the child is weaned; then will I bring him, that he may appear before Jehovah, and there abide for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what is good in thy sight: abide until thou hast weaned him; only, may Jehovah fulfil his word. And the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she took him up with her when she had weaned him, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine, and brought him to the house of Jehovah to Shiloh; and the boy was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they slaughtered the bullock, and brought the boy to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, Oh my lord, [as] thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here to pray to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this boy I prayed; and Jehovah has granted me my petition which I asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And also I have lent him to Jehovah: all the days that he lives, he is lent to Jehovah. And he worshipped Jehovah there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
