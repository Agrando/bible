And the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah as thou comest to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag the king of Amalek alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and oxen, and beasts of the second bearing, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not devote them to destruction; but everything that was mean and weak, that they destroyed utterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the word of Jehovah came to Samuel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned away from following me, and hath not fulfilled my words. And Samuel was much grieved; and he cried to Jehovah all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning. And it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him up a monument, and has turned about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed art thou of Jehovah: I have fulfilled the word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said, What [means] then this bleating of sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of oxen which I hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites, because the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samuel said to Saul, Stay, that I may tell thee what Jehovah has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, Was it not when thou wast little in thine eyes that thou [becamest] the head of the tribes of Israel, and Jehovah anointed thee king over Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehovah sent thee on a way and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then didst thou not hearken to the voice of Jehovah, but didst fall upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said to Samuel, I have indeed hearkened to the voice of Jehovah, and have gone the way which Jehovah sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the choicest of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said, Has Jehovah delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, As in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, obedience is better than sacrifice, Attention than the fat of rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion is [as] the sin of divination, And selfwill is [as] iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, He hath also rejected thee from being king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, for I have transgressed the commandment of Jehovah, and thy words; for I feared the people, and hearkened to their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, I pray thee, forgive my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn again with thee; for thou hast rejected the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah has rejected thee from being king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Samuel turned to go away, [Saul] laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Samuel said to him, Jehovah has rent the kingdom of Israel from thee to-day, and has given it to thy neighbour, who is better than thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Hope of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not a man, that he should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, I have sinned; honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Jehovah thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Samuel said, Bring ye near to me Agag the king of Amalek. And Agag came to him gaily. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless above women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel saw Saul no more until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned over Saul; and Jehovah repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
