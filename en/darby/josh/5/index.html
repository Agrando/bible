And the name of the place was called Gilgal to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and held the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they ate of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened loaves, and roasted [corn] on that same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they had eaten of the old corn of the land; and there was no more manna for the children of Israel; and they ate of the produce of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, there stood a man before him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him, and said to him: Art thou for us, or for our enemies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, No; for [as] captain of the army of Jehovah am I now come. Then Joshua fell upon his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said to him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the captain of Jehovah's army said to Joshua, Loose thy sandal from off thy foot: for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
