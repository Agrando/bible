And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Is it, in thine eyes, to honour thy father that David has sent comforters to thee? Is it not to search and overthrow, and to spy out the land that his servants are come to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Hanun took David's servants, and had them shaved, and their raiment cut off in the midst, as far as the hip, and sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And [certain] went and told David concerning the men; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Abide at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David; and Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and from the Syrians of Maacah, and from Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they hired thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people; and they came and encamped before Medeba.

And David put the battle in array against the Syrians, and they fought with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Syrians fled from before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand [in] chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and slew Shophach the captain of the host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were routed before Israel, and they made peace with David, and became his servants.
