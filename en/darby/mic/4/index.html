For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and Jehovah's word from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he shall judge among many peoples, and reprove strong nations, even afar off; and they shall forge their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they shall sit every one under his vine, and under his fig-tree; and there shall be none to make [them] afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all the peoples will walk every one in the name of his god; but we will walk in the name of Jehovah, our God for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In that day, saith Jehovah, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation; and Jehovah shall reign over them in mount Zion, from henceforth even for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And thou, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the first dominion shall come, the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now why dost thou cry out aloud?
