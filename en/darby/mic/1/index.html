Whence is the transgression of Jacob? is it not [from] Samaria? And whence are the high places of Judah? are they not [from] Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore will I make Samaria as a heap of the field, as plantings of a vineyard; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will lay bare the foundations thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her harlot-gifts shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I make a desolation; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered [them], and to a harlot's hire shall they return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this will I lament, and I will howl; I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the jackals, and mourning like the ostriches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even unto Judah, it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all; at Beth-le-aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Pass away, inhabitress of Shaphir, in nakedness [and] shame.
