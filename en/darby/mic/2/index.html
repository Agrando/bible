When the morning is light they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away; and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye walk haughtily: for it is an evil time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In that day shall they take up a proverb concerning you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, [and] say, We are utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed it from me! He hath distributed our fields to the rebellious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the measuring line upon a lot, in the congregation of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Prophesy ye not, they prophesy. If they do not prophesy to these, the ignominy will not depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O thou [that art] named the house of Jacob, Is Jehovah impatient? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip off the mantle with the garment from them that pass by securely, that are averse from war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The women of my people do ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children do ye take away my magnificence for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Arise ye, and depart; for this is not the resting-place, because of defilement that bringeth destruction, even a grievous destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If a man walking in wind and falsehood do lie, [saying,] I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink, he shall be the prophet of this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, the whole of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture: they shall make great noise by reason of [the multitude of] men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>One that breaketh through is gone up before them: they have broken forth, and have passed on to the gate, and are gone out by it; and their king passeth on before them, and Jehovah at the head of them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
