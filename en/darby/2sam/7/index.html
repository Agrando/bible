And I have given thee rest from all thine enemies; and Jehovah telleth thee that Jehovah will make thee a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It is he who shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made firm for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And king David went in and sat before Jehovah, and said, Who am I, Lord Jehovah, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And yet this hath been a small thing in thy sight, Lord Jehovah; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, Lord Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what can David say more to thee? for thou, Lord Jehovah, knowest thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, to make thy servant know [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore thou art great, Jehovah Elohim; for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And who is like thy people, like Israel, the one nation in the earth that God went to redeem to be a people to himself, and to make himself a name, and to do for them great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thyself from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And thou hast established to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, Jehovah, art become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, Jehovah Elohim, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house, fulfil it for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, Jehovah of hosts is God over Israel; and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou, Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house; therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, Lord Jehovah, thou art that God, and thy words are true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou, Lord Jehovah, hast spoken it; and with thy blessing shall the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
