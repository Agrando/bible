Therefore they say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from the Millo and inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David became continually greater; and Jehovah the God of hosts was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these are the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard [of it], and went down to the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou give them into my hand? And Jehovah said to David, Go up; for I will certainly give the Philistines into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah has broken in upon mine enemies before me, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And David inquired of Jehovah; and he said, Thou shalt not go up; turn round behind them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it shall be, when thou hearest a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then will Jehovah have gone forth before thee, to smite the army of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did so, as Jehovah had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou comest to Gezer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
