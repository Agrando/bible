So shall I be saved from mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the waves of death encompassed me, Torrents of Belial made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The bands of Sheol surrounded me; The cords of death encountered me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And I cried to my God; And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry [came] into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth shook, and quaked; The foundations of the heavens trembled And shook because he was wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals burned forth from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he bowed the heavens, and came down; And darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly; And he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he made darkness round about him a tent, Gatherings of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From the brightness before him Burned forth coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jehovah thundered from the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he sent arrows, and scattered [mine enemies]; Lightning, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the beds of the sea were seen, The foundations of the world were uncovered At the rebuke of Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He reached forth from above, he took me, He drew me out of great waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, From them that hated me; For they were mightier than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They encountered me in the day of my calamity; But Jehovah was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he brought me forth into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jehovah hath rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his ordinances were before me, And his statutes, I did not depart from them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I was upright before him, And kept myself from mine iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehovah hath recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the gracious thou dost shew thyself gracious; With the upright man thou dost shew thyself upright;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With the pure thou dost shew thyself pure; And with the perverse thou dost shew thyself contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the afflicted people thou dost save; And thine eyes are upon the haughty, [whom] thou bringest down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For thou art my lamp, Jehovah; And Jehovah enlighteneth my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For by thee I have run through a troop; By my God have I leaped over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for God, his way is perfect; The word of Jehovah is tried: He is a shield to all that trust in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who is God, save Jehovah? And who is a rock, save our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God is my strong fortress, And he maketh my way perfectly smooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], And setteth me upon my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He teacheth my hands to war, And mine arms bend a bow of brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And thou didst give me the shield of thy salvation, And thy condescending gentleness hath made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou enlargedst my steps under me; And mine ankles did not slip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them, And I turned not again till they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I have consumed them and have crushed them, and they rose not again; Yea, they fell under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And thou girdedst me with strength to battle: Thou didst subdue under me those that rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And mine enemies didst thou make to turn their backs unto me, And those that hated me I destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They looked, and there was none to save Unto Jehovah, and he answered them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And I did beat them small as the dust of the earth, I trod them as the mire of the streets; I stamped upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And thou hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, Thou hast kept me to be head of the nations: A people I knew not doth serve me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Strangers come cringing unto me: At the hearing of the ear, they obey me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Strangers have faded away, And they come trembling forth from their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jehovah liveth; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be the God, the rock of my salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The God who hath avenged me, And hath brought the peoples under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He brought me forth from mine enemies: Yea, thou hast lifted me up above them that rose up against me; From the man of violence hast thou delivered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore will I give thanks to thee, Jehovah, among the nations, And will sing psalms to thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>[It is he] who giveth great deliverances to his king, And sheweth loving-kindness to his anointed, To David, and to his seed for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
