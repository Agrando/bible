And there went back of the people twenty-two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehovah said to Gideon, Still the people are many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for thee there, and it shall be, that of whom I shall say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I shall say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he brought down the people to the water; and Jehovah said to Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down on his knees to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the number of them that lapped, with their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men; and all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah said to Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and give Midian into thy hand; and let all the people go every man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they took the victuals of the people in their hand, and their trumpets; and all the men of Israel he sent away, every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass in that night, that Jehovah said to him, Arise, go down to the camp; for I have given it into thy hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the camp;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and thou shalt hear what they say; and afterwards shall thy hand be strengthened, and thou shalt go down unto the camp. And he went down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Midian and Amalek and all the children of the east lay along in the valley as locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand upon the sea-shore for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Gideon came, and behold, a man was telling a dream to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and lo, a cake of barley-bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it; and the tent lay along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, the man of Israel: God hath given into his hand Midian and all the host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshipped. And he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Jehovah hath given into your hand the camp of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man's hand, and empty pitchers, and torches within the pitchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, Look on me, and do likewise; behold, when I come to the extremity of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, ye also shall blow the trumpets around the whole camp, and shall say, For Jehovah and for Gideon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came to the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch; and they blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the three companies blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hand, and the trumpets in their right hand for blowing, and cried, The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried out, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and Jehovah set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout the camp. And the host fled to Beth-shittah towards Zererah, to the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the men of Israel were called together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Gideon sent messengers throughout mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters unto Beth-barah, and the Jordan. And all the men of Ephraim were called together, and took the waters unto Beth-barah, and the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb; and they pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
