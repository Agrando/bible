Bless Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Ye that ride on white she-asses, ye that sit on carpets, and ye that walk by the way, consider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because of the voice of those who divide [the spoil] in the midst of the places of drawing water; There they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, His righteous acts toward his villages in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Awake, awake, Deborah! awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead captive thy captives, thou son of Abinoam!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then come down, thou, the remnant of nobles, [as his] people; Jehovah! come down with me in the midst of the mighty ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Out of Ephraim [came] those whose root was in Amalek; After thee was Benjamin among thy peoples. Out of Machir came down governors, And out of Zebulun they that handled the staff of the ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the princes in Issachar were with Deborah; And Issachar, like Barak; They were sent into the valley at his feet. In the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, To hear the bleating of the flocks? In the divisions of Reuben there were great deliberations of heart!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gilead abode beyond Jordan; And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat on the sea-shore, And abode in his creeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Zebulun is a people [that] jeoparded their lives unto death, Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Kings came, they fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan; At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; They took no spoil of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From heaven was the fight; The stars from their courses fought with Sisera.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The torrent of Kishon swept them away, That ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. My soul, thou hast trodden down strength!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then did the horse-hoofs clatter with the coursings, The coursings of their steeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Curse Meroz, saith the Angel of Jehovah; Curse, curse the inhabitants thereof; For they came not to the help of Jehovah, To the help of Jehovah among the mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, Blessed above women in the tent!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He asked water, she gave milk; In the nobles' bowl she brought forth cream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She put her hand to the tent-pin, And her right hand to the workmen's hammer; And she smote Sisera, she struck through his head, Shattered and pierced through his temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell, overcome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Them other of Sisera looketh out at the window, And crieth through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the trampings of his chariots?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The wise amongst her ladies answer [her], Yea, she returneth answer to herself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Have they not found, divided the booty, A damsel, two damsels, to each? A booty of dyed stuffs for Sisera, A booty of dyed stuffs of embroidery, Dyed stuff of double embroidery for the neck of a spoiler?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So let all thine enemies perish, Jehovah! But let them that love him be as the rising of the sun in its might. And the land had rest forty years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
