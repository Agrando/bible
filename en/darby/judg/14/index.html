And Samson said to his father, Take her for me, for she pleases me well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his father and his mother did not know that it was of Jehovah, that he was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Samson went down, and his father and his mother, to Timnathah; and they came to the vineyards of Timnathah. And behold, a young lion roared against him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he rent it as one rends a kid, and nothing was in his hand. And he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he went down and talked with the woman; and she pleased Samson well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he returned after a time to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion; and behold, [there was] a swarm of bees in the carcase of the lion, and honey;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he took it out in his hands, and went on, and ate as he went. And he came to his father and to his mother, and gave them, and they ate; but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And his father went down to the woman, and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions, and they were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samson said to them, Let me now propound a riddle to you; if ye clearly explain it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find [it] out, then I will give you thirty shirts, and thirty changes of garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if ye cannot explain [it] to me, then shall ye give me thirty shirts, and thirty changes of garments. And they said to him, Propound thy riddle, that we may hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, And out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days explain the riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Persuade thy husband, that he may explain to us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire. Have ye invited us to impoverish us, is it not [so]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not. Thou hast propounded the riddle to the children of my people, and hast not explained it to me. And he said to her, Behold, I have not explained it to my father nor my mother, and shall I explain it to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she wept before him the seven days, while they had the feast. And it came to pass on the seventh day, that he explained it to her, for she pressed him. And she explained the riddle to the children of her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey, And what stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and slew of them thirty men, and took their spoil, and gave the changes of garments unto them that explained the riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had made his friend.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
