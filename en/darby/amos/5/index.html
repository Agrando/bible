And they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! To what end is the day of Jehovah for you? It shall be darkness and not light:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>as if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will not smell [a sweet odour] in your solemn assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For if ye offer up unto me burnt-offerings and your oblations, I will not accept [them]; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fatted beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take away from me the noise of thy songs, and I will not hear the melody of thy lutes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but let judgment roll down as waters, and righteousness as an ever-flowing stream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and oblations in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of your Moloch, and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye had made to yourselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
