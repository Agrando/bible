For he will be like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' lye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he shall sit [as] a refiner and purifier of silver; and he will purify the children of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto Jehovah an oblation in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then shall the oblation of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hired servant in [his] wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger [from his right], and fear not me, saith Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I Jehovah change not, and ye, sons of Jacob, are not consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Since the days of your fathers have ye departed from my statutes, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith Jehovah of hosts. But ye say, Wherein shall we return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will a man rob God? But ye rob me.
