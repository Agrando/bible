Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith Jehovah, and I loved Jacob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and I hated Esau; and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If Edom say, We are broken down, but we will build again the ruined places, thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; and [men] shall call them the territory of wickedness, and the people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And your eyes shall see [it], and ye shall say, Jehovah is magnified beyond the border of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, priests, that despise my name. But ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? And if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? Present it now unto thy governor: will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us. This hath been of your hand: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who is there among you that would even shut the doors? and ye would not kindle [fire] on mine altar for nothing. I have no delight in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an oblation at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For from the rising of the sun even unto its setting my name shall be great among the nations; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure oblation: for my name shall be great among the nations, saith Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of the Lord is polluted; and the fruit thereof, his food, is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye say, Behold, what a weariness! And ye have puffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts, and ye bring [that which was] torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the oblation: should I accept this of your hand? saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yea, cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
