For I will bring them again into their land, which I gave unto their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith Jehovah, and they shall fish them; and afterwards will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them, from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not concealed from my face, neither is their iniquity hidden from before mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have profaned my land with the carcases of their detestable things, and with their abominations have they filled mine inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of distress, unto thee shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and they shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited falsehood [and] vanity; and in these things there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no-gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
