And their mighty ones are beaten down, and take to flight, and look not back? Terror [is] on every side, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let not the swift flee away, neither let the mighty man escape! Toward the north, hard by the river Euphrates, they have stumbled and fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who is this [that] riseth up as the Nile, whose waters toss themselves like the rivers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It is Egypt that riseth up as the Nile, and [his] waters toss themselves like the rivers; and he saith, I will rise up, I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go up, ye horses, and drive furiously, ye chariots; and let the mighty men go forth: Cush and Phut that handle the shield, and the Ludim that handle the bow [and] bend it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is the day of the Lord Jehovah of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may be avenged of his adversaries; and the sword shall devour, and it shall be sated and made drunk with their blood; for the Lord Jehovah of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country, by the river Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go up to Gilead, and fetch balm, O virgin-daughter of Egypt! In vain shalt thou multiply remedies: there is no healing for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the earth; for the mighty man stumbleth against the mighty, they are both fallen together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The word that Jehovah spoke to Jeremiah the prophet, concerning the coming of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Declare in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph, and in Tahpanhes; say, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword devoureth round about thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why are thy valiants swept away? They stood not, for Jehovah did thrust them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He made many to stumble, yea, one fell upon another; and they said, Arise, and let us return to our own people and to the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There did they cry, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he hath let the time appointed go by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[As] I live, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts, surely as Tabor among the mountains, and as Carmel by the sea, so shall he come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou, inhabitress, daughter of Egypt, furnish for thyself a captive's baggage, for Noph shall be a desolation and shall be ruined, so that none shall dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Egypt is a very fair heifer; the gad-fly cometh, it cometh from the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also her hired men in the midst of her are like fatted bullocks; for they also have turned back, they have fled away together, they did not stand; for the day of their calamity is come upon them, the time of their visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Her voice shall go like a serpent's; for they shall march with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall cut down her forest, saith Jehovah, though it be impenetrable; for they are more than the locusts, and are innumerable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The daughter of Egypt is put to shame; she is delivered into the hand of the people of the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saith, Behold, I will punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, and her gods, and her kings; yea, Pharaoh and them that confide in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will give them into the hand of those that seek their life, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants; but afterwards it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But thou, my servant Jacob, fear not, neither be dismayed, Israel: for behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none shall make [him] afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Fear thou not, my servant Jacob, saith Jehovah: for I am with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee with judgment, and I will not hold thee altogether guiltless.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
