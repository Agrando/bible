But he hearkened not to him; and Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in the place of confinement in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon and into the vaults, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>king Zedekiah sent and took him out.

And Jeremiah said, There is; and he said, Thou shalt be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in the prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And where are your prophets that prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now hear, I pray thee, my lord, O king: let my supplication, I pray thee, come before thee; and cause me not to return into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city was spent.
