For I will turn the captivity of the land as in the beginning, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In this place which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, there shall again be a habitation of shepherds causing [their] flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counteth [them], saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will perform the good word which I have spoken unto the house of Israel and unto the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety. And this is the name wherewith she shall be called: Jehovah our Righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus saith Jehovah: There shall never fail to David a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>neither shall there fail to the priests the Levites a man before me to offer up burnt-offerings, and to burn oblations, and to do sacrifice continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus saith Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant [in respect] of the day, and my covenant [in respect] of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[then] shall also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites, the priests, my ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of the heavens cannot be numbered, nor the sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hast thou not seen what this people have spoken, saying, The two families that Jehovah had chosen, he hath even cast them off? And they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus saith Jehovah: If my covenant of day and night [stand] not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of the heavens and the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[then] will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, so as not to take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will turn their captivity, and will have mercy on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
