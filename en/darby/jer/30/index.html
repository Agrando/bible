Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail; and all faces are turned into paleness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more reduce him to servitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou, my servant Jacob, fear not, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and at ease, and none shall make [him] afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee; yet of thee will I not make a full end, but I will correct thee with judgment, and will not hold thee altogether guiltless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus saith Jehovah: Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound is grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is none to plead thy cause, to bind up [thy wound]; thou hast no healing medicines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not. For I have smitten thee with the stroke of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity: thy sins are manifold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why criest thou because of thy bruise? thy sorrow is incurable; for the greatness of thine iniquity, [because] thy sins are manifold, I have done these things unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all that devour thee shall be devoured, and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be for a spoil; and all they that prey upon thee will I give to be a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will apply a bandage unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; for they have called thee an outcast: This is Zion that no man seeketh after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his habitations; and the city shall be built upon her own heap; and the palace shall be inhabited after the manner thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving, and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished; and I will honour them, and they shall not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And their sons shall be as aforetime; and their assembly shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to approach, and he shall draw near unto me. For who is this that engageth his heart to draw near unto me? saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, a tempest of Jehovah, fury is gone forth, a sweeping storm: it shall whirl down upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have executed, and until he have performed the purposes of his heart. At the end of the days ye shall consider it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
