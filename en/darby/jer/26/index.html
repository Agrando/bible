And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the princes of Judah heard these things; and they went up from the king's house unto the house of Jehovah, and sat in the entry of the new gate of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the priests and the prophets spoke unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die, for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now, amend your ways and your doings, and hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But as for me, behold, I am in your hand; do unto me as seemeth good and right in your eyes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>only know for certain that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth Jehovah hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the princes and all the people said unto the priests and to the prophets, This man is not worthy to die; for he hath spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there rose up certain of the elders of the land and spoke to all the congregation of the people, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be ploughed [as] a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? Did he not fear Jehovah, and supplicate Jehovah, and Jehovah repented him of the evil that he had pronounced against them? And we should be doing a great evil against our souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of Jehovah, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim: and he prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and Jehoiakim the king, and all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, and the king sought to put him to death; but Urijah heard it, and he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and men with him, into Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; and he slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the children of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
