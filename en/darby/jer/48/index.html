Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled; Kirjathaim is put to shame, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Moab's praise is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from [being] a nation. Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be cut down; the sword shall pursue thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A voice of crying from Horonaim; wasting and great destruction!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For by the ascent of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the descent of Horonaim is heard the anguish of the cry of destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee, save your lives, and be like a shrub in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For because thou hast confided in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken, and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the waster shall come upon every city, that not a city shall escape; and the valley shall perish, and the plateau shall be destroyed: as Jehovah hath said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Give wings unto Moab, that she may flee and get away; and the cities thereof shall become a desolation, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and hath settled on his lees; he hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste hath remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will send unto him pourers that shall pour him off, and shall empty his vessels, and break in pieces his flagons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How do ye say, We are mighty, and men of valour for the war?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moab is laid waste, and his cities are gone up [in smoke], and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come down from [thy] glory and sit in the drought, O inhabitress, daughter of Dibon; the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee, thy strongholds hath he destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Stand by the way, and watch, inhabitress of Aroer; ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth; say, What is done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moab is put to shame; for he is broken down: howl and cry; tell it in Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And judgment is come upon the country of the plateau; upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and upon Kirjathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and upon Kerijoth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Make him drunken, for he magnified himself against Jehovah; and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For was not Israel a derision unto thee? Was he found among thieves, that as oft as thou didst speak of him, thou didst shake the head?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Leave the cities, and dwell in the rocks, ye inhabitants of Moab, and be like the dove, that maketh her nest in the sides of the cave's mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We have heard of the arrogance of Moab, [he is] very proud; his loftiness, and his arrogance, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I know his wrath, saith Jehovah; his pratings are vain: they do not as [they say].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall there be moaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with more than the weeping of Jaazer: thy shoots passed over the sea, they reached to the sea of Jaazer. The spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And joy and gladness is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: they shall no more tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Because of the cry from Heshbon, unto Elaleh, unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar unto Horonaim, [unto] Eglath-shelishijah: for even the waters of Nimrim shall become desolations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will cause to cease in Moab, saith Jehovah, him that offereth in the high place, and him that burneth incense to his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres; because the abundance that he hath gotten is perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For every head is bald, and every beard clipped; upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>It is wholly lamentation upon all the housetops of Moab, and in the public places thereof; for I have broken Moab, like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They howl, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! And Moab shall be a derision and a terror to all that are round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread forth his wings over Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Kerijoth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and at that day the heart of the mighty men of Moab shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Fear, and the pit, and the snare shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon her, upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon powerless; for a fire hath come forth from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath consumed the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Woe to thee, Moab! The people of Chemosh is undone; for thy sons are taken away in captivity, and thy daughters are captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But I will turn the captivity of Moab at the end of the days, saith Jehovah. Thus far is the judgement of Moab.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
