Did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice? Then it was well with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thine eyes and thy heart are only on thine extortion, and on the blood of the innocent, to shed it, and on oppression and on violence, to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah: They shall not lament for him, Ah, my brother! or, Ah, sister! They shall not lament for him, Ah, lord! or Ah, his glory!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, dragged along and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and give forth thy voice in Bashan, and cry from [the heights of] Abarim: for all thy lovers are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity; [but] thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy way from thy youth, that thou hearkenedst not unto my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind shall feed on all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; surely, then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thou inhabitress of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how pitiful shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, pain as of a woman in travail!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[As] I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were a signet upon my right hand, yet will I pluck thee thence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them before whom thou art afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And into the land whereunto they lift up their souls to return, thither shall they not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is this man Coniah a despised broken vase? a vessel wherein is no delight? Wherefore are they thrown out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus saith Jehovah: Write this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
