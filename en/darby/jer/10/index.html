Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There is none like unto thee, Jehovah; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? For to thee doth it appertain; for among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they are one and all senseless and foolish; the teaching of vanities is a stock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artizan and of the hands of the founder; blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of skilful [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Jehovah Elohim is truth; he is the living God, and the King of eternity. At his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations cannot abide his indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus shall ye say unto them: The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Every man is become brutish, bereft of knowledge; every founder is put to shame by the graven image, for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The portion of Jacob is not like them; for it is he that hath formed all [things], and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather up thy baggage out of the land, O inhabitress of the fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will this time sling out the inhabitants of the land, and will distress them, that they may be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe is me, for my wound! My stroke is hard to heal, and I had said, Yea, this is [my] grief, and I will bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent is despoiled, and all my cords are broken; my children are gone forth from me, and they are not; there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not sought Jehovah; therefore have they not acted wisely, and all their flock is scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The voice of a rumour! Behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I know, Jehovah, that the way of man is not his own; it is not in a man that walketh to direct his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jehovah, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out thy fury upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name; for they have eaten up Jacob, yea, they have eaten him up and consumed him, and have laid waste his dwelling-place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
