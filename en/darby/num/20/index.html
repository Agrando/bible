And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory; and Israel turned away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they removed from Kadesh; and the children of Israel, the whole assembly, came to mount Hor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron in mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Aaron shall be gathered unto his peoples; for he shall not enter into the land that I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my commandment at the waters of Meribah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron shall be gathered [to his peoples], and shall die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses did as Jehovah had commanded, and they went up mount Hor before the eyes of the whole assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there upon the top of the mountain; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the whole assembly saw that Aaron was dead, and they mourned for Aaron thirty days, [even] the whole house of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
