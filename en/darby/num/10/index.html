of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall serve for the calling together of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when they shall blow with them, the whole assembly shall gather to thee at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if they blow with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie eastward shall set forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie southward shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm on their setting forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not blow an alarm:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an everlasting statute throughout your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over your sacrifices of peace-offering; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth of the month, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the children of Israel set forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai;
