He shall consume the nations his enemies, and break their bones, and with his arrows shall smite [them] in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He stooped, he lay down like a lion, and like a lioness: who will stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast altogether blessed [them] these three times!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now flee thou to thy place; I said I would very highly honour thee, and behold, Jehovah has kept thee back from honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of Jehovah to do good or bad out of my heart: what Jehovah shall say, that will I speak?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now behold, I go to my people: come, I will admonish thee what this people will do to thy people at the end of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor saith, and the man of opened eye saith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He saith, who heareth the words of God, who knoweth the knowledge of the Most High, Who seeth the vision of the Almighty, who falleth down, and who hath his eyes open:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh: There cometh a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and he shall cut in pieces the corners of Moab, and destroy all the sons of tumult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Edom shall be a possession, and Seir a possession, they, his enemies; but Israel will do valiantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And one out of Jacob shall have dominion, and will destroy out of the city what remaineth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he saw Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, Amalek is the first of the nations, but his latter end shall be for destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he saw the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Firm is thy dwelling-place, and thy nest fixed in the rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Kenite shall be consumed, until Asshur shall carry thee away captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Alas! Who shall live when God doeth this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and afflict Asshur, and afflict Eber, and he also shall be for destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
