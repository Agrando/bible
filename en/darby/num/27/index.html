Give unto us a possession among the brethren of our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Moses brought their cause before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And unto the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he have no daughter, ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if he have no brethren, ye shall give his inheritance unto his father's brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if his father have no brethren, ye shall give his inheritance to his kinsman that is nearest to him in his family, and he shall possess it; and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of right, as Jehovah commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land that I have given unto the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother was gathered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>because ye rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, as to hallowing me in the matter of the water before their eyes.
