and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he hath despised the word of Jehovah, and hath broken his commandment: that soul shall surely be cut off;

and that ye seek not after [the lusts of] your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye go a whoring;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>that ye may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God: I am Jehovah your God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
