Will ye render me a recompence? But if ye recompense me, swiftly [and] speedily will I bring your recompence upon your own head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my beautiful pleasant things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the children of the Greeks, that ye might remove them far from their border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I will raise them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will bring your recompence upon your own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Proclaim this among the nations: prepare war, arouse the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your pruning-knives into spears; let the weak say, I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Haste ye and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together. Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let the nations rouse themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down, for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Jehovah is at hand in the valley of decision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: and Jehovah will be a shelter for his people, and the refuge of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And ye shall know that I, Jehovah, [am] your God, dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain; and Jerusalem shall be holy, and no strangers shall pass through her any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the water-courses of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of Shittim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, in that they have shed innocent blood in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will purge them from the blood from which I had not purged them: for Jehovah dwelleth in Zion.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
