And if any one wills to injure them, thus must he be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These have power to shut the heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth as often as they will with every plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they shall have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and shall conquer them, and shall kill them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and their body [shall be] on the street of the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And [men] of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their body three days and a half, and they do not suffer their bodies to be put into a sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they that dwell upon the earth rejoice over them, and are full of delight, and shall send gifts one to another, because these, the two prophets, tormented them that dwell upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after the three days and a half [the] spirit of life from God came into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, Come up here; and they went up to the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand names of men were slain in the earthquake.
