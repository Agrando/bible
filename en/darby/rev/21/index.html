And he says [to me], Write, for these words are true and faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to him that thirsts of the fountain of the water of life freely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He that overcomes shall inherit these things, and I will be to him God, and he shall be to me son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But to the fearful and unbelieving, [and sinners], and those who make themselves abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, their part [is] in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone; which is the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came one of the seven angels which had had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke with me, saying, Come here, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he carried me away in [the] Spirit, [and set me] on a great and high mountain, and shewed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>having the glory of God. Her shining [was] like a most precious stone, as a crystal-like jasper stone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names inscribed, which are those of the twelve tribes of [the] sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On [the] east three gates; and on [the] north three gates; and on [the] south three gates; and on [the] west three gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he that spoke with me had a golden reed [as] a measure, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the city lies four-square, and its length [is] as much as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand stadia: the length and the breadth and height of it are equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he measured its wall, a hundred [and] forty-four cubits, [a] man's measure, that is, [the] angel's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the building of its wall [was] jasper; and the city pure gold, like pure glass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the foundations of the wall of the city [were] adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the twelve gates, twelve pearls; each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl; and the street of the city pure gold, as transparent glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon, that they should shine for it; for the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof [is] the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the nations shall walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And its gates shall not be shut at all by day, for night shall not be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And nothing common, nor that maketh an abomination and a lie, shall at all enter into it; but those only who [are] written in the book of life of the Lamb.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
