To him that overcomes, I will give to him to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write: These things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know thy tribulation and thy poverty; but thou art rich; and the railing of those who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but a synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear nothing [of] what thou art about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He that overcomes shall in no wise be injured of the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the angel of the assembly in Pergamos write: These things says he that has the sharp two-edged sword:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan [is]; and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in the days in which Antipas my faithful witness [was], who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against thee: that thou hast there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a snare before the sons of Israel, to eat [of] idol sacrifices and commit fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So thou also hast those who hold the doctrine of Nicolaitanes in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent therefore: but if not, I come to thee quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him that overcomes, to him will I give of the hidden manna; and I will give to him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he that receives [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know thy works, and love, and faith, and service, and thine endurance, and thy last works [to be] more than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches and leads astray my servants to commit fornication and eat of idol sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gave her time that she should repent, and she will not repent of her fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and her children will I kill with death; and all the assemblies shall know that *I* am he that searches [the] reins and [the] hearts; and I will give to you each according to your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to you I say, the rest who [are] in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but what ye have hold fast till I shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he that overcomes, and he that keeps unto the end my works, to him will I give authority over the nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod; as vessels of pottery are they broken in pieces, as I also have received from my Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I will give to him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
