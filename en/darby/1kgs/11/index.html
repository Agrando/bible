And he said, Nothing; but in any case let me depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>God stirred him up yet an adversary, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from Hadadezer king of Zobah, his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he collected men to him, and became captain of a band, when David slew them [of Zobah]; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and reigned in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zeredah, Solomon's servant (whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman), even he lifted up his hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon was building Millo, and closing the breach of the city of David his father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the man Jeroboam was strong and valiant; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass at that time that Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Ahijah seized the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but one tribe shall he have for my servant David's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my sight, and my statutes and mine ordinances, as David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; for I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake, whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, the ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen for myself to put my name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will take thee, that thou mayest reign over all that thy soul desireth, and thou shalt be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my sight, in keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, that I will be with thee, and build thee a lasting house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Solomon sought to kill Jeroboam; and Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt; and he was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
