And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, I have something to say to thee. And she said, Speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and all Israel had set their faces on me that I should reign; but the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother's, for it was his from Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now I ask one petition of thee; refuse me not. And she said to him, Speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king for he will not refuse thee that he give me Abishag the Shunammite as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Bathsheba went to king Solomon, to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne; and he caused a throne to be set for the king's mother, and she sat on his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; refuse me not. And the king said to her, Ask, my mother, for I will not refuse thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And king Solomon swore by Jehovah saying, God do so to me, and more also, Adonijah has spoken this word against his own life!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And now [as] Jehovah liveth, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who fell on him, that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Go to Anathoth, to thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death; but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou didst bear the ark of Adonai Jehovah before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, to fulfil the word of Jehovah, which he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the report came to Joab (for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he had not turned after Absalom); and Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it was told king Solomon that Joab had fled to the tent of Jehovah; and behold, he is by the altar. And Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Benaiah came to the tent of Jehovah and said to him, Thus saith the king: Come forth. And he said, No; for I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him; and take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me and from the house of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jehovah shall requite the blood which he shed upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, without my father David's knowledge: Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And their blood shall be requited upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and fell upon him, and put him to death; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his stead over the host; and Zadok the priest the king put in the stead of Abiathar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem, and abide there, and go not forth thence anywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it shall be that on the day thou goest forth, and passest over the torrent of Kidron, know for certain that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good: as my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two servants of Shimei's ran away to Achish son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath, to Achish, to seek his servants; and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and had come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not make thee swear by Jehovah, and protest to thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou goest forth, and walkest abroad anywhere, thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst to me, The word that I have heard is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why then hast thou not kept the oath of Jehovah, and the commandment that I charged thee with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the king said to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness of which thy heart is conscious, which thou didst to David my father; and Jehovah returns thy wickedness upon thine own head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before Jehovah for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; who went out and fell upon him, and he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
