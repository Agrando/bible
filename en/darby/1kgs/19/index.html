And behold, an angel touched him, and said to him, Arise, eat!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he looked, and behold, at his head was a cake, baked on hot stones, and a cruse of water. And he ate and drank, and lay down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the angel of Jehovah came again the second time, and touched him, and said, Arise, eat; for the journey is too great for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he arose, and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there he went into a cave, and lodged there. And behold, the word of Jehovah [came] to him, and he said to him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I am left, I alone, and they seek my life, to take it away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before Jehovah. And behold, Jehovah passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and broke in pieces the rocks before Jehovah: Jehovah was not in the wind. And after the wind, an earthquake: Jehovah was not in the earthquake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after the earthquake, a fire: Jehovah was not in the fire. And after the fire, a soft gentle voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice [came] to him and said, What doest thou here, Elijah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, I have been very jealous for Jehovah the God of hosts; for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I am left, I alone, and they seek my life, to take it away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jehovah said to him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when thou comest, anoint Hazael king over Syria;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint king over Israel; and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint prophet in thy stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall come to pass, [that] him that escapeth the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay; and him that escapeth the sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet I have left [myself] seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth that hath not kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was ploughing [with] twelve yokes before him, and he with the twelfth; and Elijah went over to him, and cast his mantle on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and I will follow thee. And he said to him, Go back again; for what have I done to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he returned back from him, and took the yoke of oxen, and killed them, and boiled their flesh with the implements of the oxen, and gave to the people, and they ate. And he arose and went after Elijah, and ministered to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
