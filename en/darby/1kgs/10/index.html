Because Jehovah loves Israel for ever, therefore did he make thee king, to do judgment and justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she gave the king a hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices in very great abundance, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as those which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(And the fleet also of Hiram, which carried gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir sandal-wood in very great abundance, and precious stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king made of the sandal-wood a balustrade for the house of Jehovah, and for the king's house, and harps and lutes for the singers. There came no such sandal-wood, nor was there seen to this day.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, besides what he gave her of the bounty of king Solomon. And she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>besides what [came] by the dealers, and by the traffic of the merchants, and by all the kings of Arabia, and by the governors of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold, he applied six hundred [shekels] of gold to one target;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and three hundred shields of beaten gold, he applied three minas of gold to one shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with refined gold:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was rounded behind; and there were arms on each side at the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the arms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of precious gold: none were of silver, [which] was not of the least account in the days of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the king had on the sea a Tarshish-fleet, with the fleet of Hiram: once in three years came the Tarshish-fleet, bringing gold and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And king Solomon was greater than all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armour, and spices, horses and mules, a rate year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen; and he had a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; and he placed them in the chariot-cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he as the sycamores that are in the lowland for abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the exportation of horses that Solomon had was from Egypt: a caravan of the king's merchants fetched a drove [of horses], at a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so they brought [them] by their means, for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
