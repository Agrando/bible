And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hiram had sent to the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is the account of the levy which king Solomon raised, to build the house of Jehovah, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer, and burned it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Solomon built Gezer, and lower Beth-horon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and cities for chariots, and cities for the horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and on Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All the people that were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the children of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, upon them did Solomon impose a tribute of bondservice until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen; but they were men of war, and his servants, and his chiefs, and his captains, and captains of his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These were the chief superintendents that were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, that ruled over the people that wrought in the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which he had built for her: then he built Millo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And three times in the year did Solomon offer up burnt-offerings and peace-offerings upon the altar that he had built to Jehovah, and he burned incense upon that which was before Jehovah.
