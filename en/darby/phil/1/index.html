at any rate, in every way, whether in pretext or in truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, yea, also I will rejoice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for I know that this shall turn out for me to salvation, through your supplication and [the] supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but in all boldness, as always, now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For for me to live [is] Christ, and to die gain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but if to live in flesh [is my lot], this is for me worth the while: and what I shall choose I cannot tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I am pressed by both, having the desire for departure and being with Christ, [for] [it is] very much better,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but remaining in the flesh [is] more necessary for your sakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and having confidence of this, I know that I shall remain and abide along with you all, for your progress and joy in faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that your boasting may abound in Christ Jesus through me by my presence again with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ, in order that whether coming and seeing you, or absent, I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and not frightened in anything by the opposers, which is to them a demonstration of destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>because to you has been given, as regards Christ, not only the believing on him but the suffering for him also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same conflict which ye have seen in me, and now hear of in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
