The Lord [is] near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things [are] true, whatsoever things [are] noble, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] amiable, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue and if any praise, think on these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I rejoiced in [the] Lord greatly, that now however at length ye have revived your thinking of me, though surely ye did also think [of me], but lacked opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that I speak as regards privation, for as to me *I* have learnt in those circumstances in which I am, to be satisfied in myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have strength for all things in him that gives me power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But ye have done well in taking part in my affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And know also *ye*, O Philippians, that in [the] beginning of the gospel, when I came out of Macedonia, no assembly communicated [anything] to me in [the] way of giving and receiving save *ye* alone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me for my need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not that I seek gift, but I seek fruit abounding to your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I have all things in full supply and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But to our God and Father [be] glory to the ages of ages. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who [are] with me salute you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All the saints salute you, and specially those of the household of Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.
