among whom ye appear as lights in [the] world,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>holding forth [the] word of life, so as to be a boast for me in Christ's day, that I have not run in vain nor laboured in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if also I am poured out as a libation on the sacrifice and ministration of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice in common with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In like manner do *ye* also rejoice, and rejoice with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I hope in [the] Lord Jesus to send Timotheus to you shortly, that *I* also may be refreshed, knowing how ye get on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no one like-minded who will care with genuine feeling how ye get on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For all seek their own things, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child a father, he has served with me in the work of the glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I shall see how it goes with me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but I trust in [the] Lord that I myself also shall soon come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-workman and fellow-soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>since he had a longing desire after you all, and was distressed because ye had heard that he was sick;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for he was also sick close to death, but God had mercy on him, and not indeed on him alone, but also on me, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that seeing him ye might again rejoice, and that *I* might be the less sorrowful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him therefore in [the] Lord with all joy, and hold such in honour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because for the sake of the work he drew near even to death, venturing his life that he might fill up what lacked in your ministration toward me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
