I do not know Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, wish to have the people go off from their works?
