And Moses said to them, This is the bread which Jehovah has given you to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Gather of it every man according to what he can eat, an omer a poll, [according to] the number of your persons: ye shall take every man for those that are in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some much, some little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they measured with the omer: then he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little wanted nothing: they had gathered every man according to the measure of his eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses said to them, Let no man leave [any] of it until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they did not hearken to Moses; and some men left of it until the morning; then worms bred in it and it stank. And Moses was wroth with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they gathered it every morning, every man as much as he could eat; and when the sun became hot, it melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass on the sixth day, that they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one; and all the princes of the assembly came and told Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has said: To-morrow is the rest, the holy sabbath, of Jehovah: bake what ye will bake, and cook what ye will cook; and lay up for yourselves all that remains over, to be kept for the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they laid it up for the morning, as Moses had commanded; and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, Eat it to-day; for to-day is sabbath to Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Six days shall ye gather it; but on the seventh day is sabbath: on it there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day that there went out [some] from the people to gather [it], and they found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do ye refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See, for Jehovah hath given you the sabbath; therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread for two days. Abide every man in his place: let no man go from his place on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the people rested on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the house of Israel called its name Manna; and it was like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it was like cake with honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread that I gave you to eat in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put in it an omer full of manna, and deposit it before Jehovah, to be kept for your generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so Aaron deposited it before the Testimony, to be kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came into an inhabited land: they ate the manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now an omer is the tenth [part] of an ephah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
