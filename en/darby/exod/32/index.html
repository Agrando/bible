Turn from the heat of thine anger, and repent of this evil against thy people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou sworest by thyself, and saidst to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall possess [it] for ever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah repented of the evil that he had said he would do to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, [with] the two tables of the testimony in his hand tables written on both their sides: on this side and on that were they written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the tables [were] God's work, and the writing was God's writing, engraven on the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, and said to Moses, There is a shout of war in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, It is not the sound of a shout of victory, neither is it the sound of a shout of defeat: it is the noise of alternate singing I hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, when he came near the camp, and saw the calf and the dancing, that Moses' anger burned, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and shattered them beneath the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took the calf that they had made, and burned [it] with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed [it] on the water, and made the children of Israel drink [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said to Aaron, What has this people done to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin on them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord burn! thou knowest the people, that they are [set] on mischief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they said to me, Make us a god, who will go before us; for this Moses, the man that has brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what is become of him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I said to them, Who has gold? They broke [it] off, and gave [it] me, and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses saw the people how they were stripped; for Aaron had stripped them to [their] shame before their adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, He that is for Jehovah, [let him come] to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Put every man his sword upon his hip; go and return from gate to gate through the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah, yea, every man with his son, and with his brother, and bring on yourselves a blessing to-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass the next day, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to Jehovah: perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Alas, this people has sinned a great sin, and they have made themselves a god of gold!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now, if thou wilt forgive their sin but if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book that thou hast written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And now go, lead the people whither I have told thee: behold, my Angel shall go before thee; but in the day of my visiting I will visit their sin upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron had made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
