And Moses said to them, Why do ye dispute with me? Why do ye tempt Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is it that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do with this people? Yet a little, and they will stone me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel, and thy staff with which thou didst smite the river, take in thy hand, and go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock on Horeb; and thou shalt strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink.
