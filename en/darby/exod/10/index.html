And he turned and went out from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Pharaoh's bondmen said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: dost thou not yet know that Egypt is ruined?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh. And he said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God. Who are they that shall go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters; with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we have a feast of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, Let Jehovah be so with you, as I let you go, and your little ones: see that evil is before you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not so: go now, ye [that are] men, and serve Jehovah! for it is that ye have desired. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up over the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land all that the hail hath left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt, very grievous; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they covered the face of the whole land, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; and there remained not any green thing on the trees, and in the herbs of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, forgive, I pray you, my sin only this time, and intreat Jehovah your God that he may take away from me this death only!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jehovah turned a very powerful west wind, which took away the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea: there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not let the children of Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward the heavens, that there may be darkness in the land of Egypt so that one may feel darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens; and there was a thick darkness throughout the land of Egypt three days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place, for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pharaoh called Moses and said, Go, serve Jehovah; only, let your flocks and your herds remain; let your little ones also go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, Thou must give also sacrifices and burnt-offerings into our hands, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our cattle also must go with us: there shall not a hoof be left behind; for we must take thereof to serve Jehovah our God; and we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he would not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Pharaoh said to him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, Thou hast spoken rightly: I will see thy face again no more!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
