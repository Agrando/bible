These are the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses came and called the elders of the people, and laid before the mall these words which Jehovah had commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah has spoken will we do! And Moses brought the words of the people back to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, I will come to thee in the cloud's thick darkness, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee also for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and hallow them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and let them be ready for the third day; for on the third day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people on mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And set bounds round about the people, saying, Take heed to yourselves, [not] to go up unto the mountain nor touch the border of it: whatever toucheth the mountain shall certainly be put to death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>not a hand shall touch it, but it shall certainly be stoned, or shot through; whether it be a beast or a man, it shall not live. When the long drawn note of the trumpet soundeth, they shall come up to the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses came down from the mountain to the people, and hallowed the people; and they washed their clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day; do not come near [your] wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and the sound of the trumpet exceeding loud; and the whole people that was in the camp trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the foot of the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the whole of mount Sinai smoked, because Jehovah descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace; and the whole mountain shook greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the sound of the trumpet increased and became exceeding loud; Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mountain; and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, testify to the people that they break not through to Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, shall hallow themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai; for thou hast testified to us, saying, Set bounds about the mountain, and hallow it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jehovah said to him, Go, descend, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but the priests and the people shall not break through to go up to Jehovah, lest he break forth on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses went down to the people, and told them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
