Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I [am] [the] voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] Lord, as said Esaias the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they were sent from among the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye? And *they* said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He says to them, Come and see. They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard [this] from John and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus finds Philip, and says to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold [one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
