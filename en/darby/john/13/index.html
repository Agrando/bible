Jesus answered him, Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus says to him, He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet, but is wholly clean; and ye are clean, but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew him that delivered him up: on account of this he said, Ye are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When therefore he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, having sat down again, he said to them, Do ye know what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Ye call me the Teacher and the Lord, and ye say well, for I am [so].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I therefore, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for I have given you an example that, as I have done to you, ye should do also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Verily, verily, I say to you, The bondman is not greater than his lord, nor the sent greater than he who has sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If ye know these things, blessed are ye if ye do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I speak not of you all. I know those whom I have chosen; but that the scripture might be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I tell you [it] now before it happens, that when it happens, ye may believe that I am [he].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily, I say to you, He who receives whomsoever I shall send receives me; and he that receives me receives him who has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Having said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and testified and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples therefore looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there was at table one of his disciples in the bosom of Jesus, whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter makes a sign therefore to him to ask who it might be of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he, leaning on the breast of Jesus, says to him, Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answers, He it is to whom I, after I have dipped the morsel, give it. And having dipped the morsel, he gives it to Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, after the morsel, then entered Satan into him. Jesus therefore says to him, What thou doest, do quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But none of those at table knew why he said this to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for some supposed, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy the things of which we have need for the feast; or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Having therefore received the morsel, he went out immediately; and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When therefore he was gone out Jesus says, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God be glorified in him, God also shall glorify him in himself, and shall glorify him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me; and, as I said to the Jews, Where I go ye cannot come, I say to you also now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give to you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall all know that ye are disciples of mine, if ye have love amongst yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where goest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I go thou canst not follow me now, but thou shalt follow me after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter says to him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answers, Thou wilt lay down thy life for me! Verily, verily, I say to thee, The cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
