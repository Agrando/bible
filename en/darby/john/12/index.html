[And] if any one serve me, him shall the Father honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But on account of this have I come to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, I both have glorified and will glorify [it] again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The crowd therefore, which stood [there] and heard [it], said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, Not on my account has this voice come, but on yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is [the] judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But this he said signifying by what death he was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides for ever; and how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who *is* this, the Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light amongst you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you. And he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light. Jesus said these things, and going away hid himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But though he had done so many signs before them, they believed not on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of the prophet Esaias which he said might be fulfilled, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>On this account they could not believe, because Esaias said again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart and be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Although indeed from among the rulers also many believed on him, but on account of the Pharisees did not confess [him], that they might not be put out of the synagogue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved glory from men rather than glory from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and he that beholds me, beholds him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I am come into the world [as] light, that every one that believes on me may not abide in darkness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and if any one hear my words and do not keep [them], I judge him not, for I am not come that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He that rejects me and does not receive my words, has him who judges him: the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and I know that his commandment is life eternal. What therefore I speak, as the Father has said to me, so I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
