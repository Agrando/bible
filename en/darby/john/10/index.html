The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but he who serves for wages, and who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now he who serves for wages flees because he serves for wages, and is not himself concerned about the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a division again among the Jews on account of these words;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but many of them said, He has a demon and raves; why do ye hear him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These sayings are not [those] of one that is possessed by a demon. Can a demon open blind people's eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at Jerusalem, and it was winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the Christ, say [so] to us openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye do not believe. The works which I do in my Father's name, these bear witness concerning me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I give them life eternal; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father who has given [them] to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewn you of my Father; for which work of them do ye stone me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called *them* gods to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may know [and believe] that the Father is in me and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They sought therefore again to take him; and he went away from out of their hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptising at the first: and he abode there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to him, and said, John did no sign; but all things which John said of this [man] were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed on him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
