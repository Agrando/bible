But Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his finger on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again stooping down he wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they, having heard [that], went out one by one beginning from the elder ones until the last; and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jesus, lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Has no one condemned thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she said, No one, sir. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is true, because I know whence I came and whither I go: but ye know not whence I come and whither I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Ye judge according to the flesh, I judge no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if also I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two men is true:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am [one] who bear witness concerning myself, and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said to him therefore, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words spoke he in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one took him, for his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said therefore again to them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin; where I go ye cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I go ye cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above. Ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins; for unless ye shall believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said therefore to him, Who art thou? [And] Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but he that has sent me is true, and I, what I have heard from him, these things I say to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus therefore said to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he spoke these things many believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him, If ye abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never been under bondage to any one; how sayest thou, Ye shall become free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever: the son abides for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word has no entrance in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak what I have seen with my Father, and ye then do what ye have seen with your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Ye do the works of your father. They said [therefore] to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one father, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, If God were your father ye would have loved me, for I came forth from God and am come [from him]; for neither am I come of myself, but *he* has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do ye not know my speech? Because ye cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Ye are of the devil, as [your] father, and ye desire to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks falsehood, he speaks of what is his own; for he is a liar and its father:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and because I speak the truth, ye do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convinces me of sin? If I speak truth, why do ye not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He that is of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I do not seek my own glory: there is he that seeks and judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any one shall keep my word, he shall never see death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews therefore said to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham has died, and the prophets, and thou sayest, If any one keep my word, he shall never taste death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who has died? and the prophets have died: whom makest thou thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me, [of] whom ye say, He is our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And ye know him not; but I know him; and if I said, I know him not, I should be like you, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Jews therefore said to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>They took up therefore stones that they might cast [them] at him; but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple, [going through the midst of them, and thus passed on.]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
