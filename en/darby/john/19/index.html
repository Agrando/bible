And he says to them, Behold the man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying, Crucify, crucify [him]. Pilate says to them, Take him ye and crucify [him], for I find no fault in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to [our] law he ought to die, because he made himself Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was the rather afraid,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pilate therefore says to him, Speakest thou not to *me*? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered, Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above. On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [the] greater sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From this time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out saying, If thou releasest this [man], thou art not a friend to Caesar. Every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate therefore, having heard these words, led Jesus out and sat down upon [the] judgment-seat, at a place called Pavement, but in Hebrew Gabbatha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(now it was [the] preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour;) and he says to the Jews, Behold your king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they cried out, Take [him] away, take [him] away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then therefore he delivered him up to them, that he might be crucified; and they took Jesus and led him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called [place] of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one] on this side, and [one] on that, and Jesus in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross. But there was written: Jesus the Nazaraean, the King of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This title therefore many of the Jews read, for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was near; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but that *he* said, I am king of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and the body-coat; but the body-coat was seamless, woven through the whole from the top.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They said therefore to one another, Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my garments among themselves, and on my vesture they cast lots. The soldiers therefore did these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he says unto the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop round it, they put it up to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and having bowed his head, he delivered up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for it was [the] preparation, (for the day of that sabbath was a great [day],) demanded of Pilate that their legs might be broken and they taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly through fear of the Jews, demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus: and Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Nicodemus also, who at first came to Jesus by night, came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [weight].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in linen with the spices, as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But there was in the place where he had been crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There therefore, on account of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
