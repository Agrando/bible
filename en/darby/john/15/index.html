As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abide in the vine, thus neither [can] ye unless ye abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, ye [are] the branches. He that abides in me and I in him, *he* bears much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Unless any one abide in me he is cast out as the branch, and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and ye shall become disciples of mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have spoken these things to you that my joy may be in you, and your joy be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one has greater love than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye are my friends if ye practise whatever I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I call you no longer bondmen, for the bondman does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and have set you that ye should go and [that] ye should bear fruit, and [that] your fruit should abide, that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he may give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things I command you, that ye love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hate you, know that it has hated me before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on account of this the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word which I said unto you, The bondman is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will keep also yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they have not known him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He that hates me hates also my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them the works which no other one has done, they had not had sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But that the word written in their law might be fulfilled, They hated me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father, *he* shall bear witness concerning me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from [the] beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
