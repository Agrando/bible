But I did not say these things unto you from [the] beginning, because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I go to him that has sent me, and none of you demands of me, Where goest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I say the truth to you, It is profitable for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you; but if I go I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having come, he will bring demonstration to the world, of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>of sin, because they do not believe on me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of righteousness, because I go away to [my] Father, and ye behold me no longer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when *he* is come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but whatsoever he shall hear he shall speak; and he will announce to you what is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine and shall announce [it] to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things that the Father has are mine; on account of this I have said that he receives of mine and shall announce [it] to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little while and ye shall see me, [because I go away to the Father].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Some] of his disciples therefore said to one another, What is this he says to us, A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little while and ye shall see me, and, Because I go away to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore, What is this which he says [of] the little while? We do not know [of] what he speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus knew therefore that they desired to demand of him, and said to them, Do ye inquire of this among yourselves that I said, A little while and ye do not behold me; and again a little while and ye shall see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Verily, verily, I say to you, that ye shall weep and lament, ye, but the world shall rejoice; and ye will be grieved, but your grief shall be turned to joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman, when she gives birth to a child, has grief because her hour has come; but when the child is born, she no longer remembers the trouble, on account of the joy that a man has been born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye now therefore have grief; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day ye shall demand nothing of me: verily, verily, I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things I have spoken to you in allegories; the hour is coming that I will no longer speak to you in allegories, but will declare to you openly concerning the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day ye shall ask in my name; and I say not to you that I will demand of the Father for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself has affection for you, because ye have had affection for me, and have believed that I came out from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples say to him, Lo, now thou speakest openly and utterest no allegory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast not need that any one should demand of thee. By this we believe that thou art come from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, [the] hour is coming, and has come, that ye shall be scattered, each to his own, and shall leave me alone; and [yet] I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things have I spoken to you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye have tribulation; but be of good courage: I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
