[The] night is coming, when no one can work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As long as I am in the world, I am [the] light of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed, and came seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbours therefore, and those who used to see him before, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that was sitting and begging?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, It is he; others said, No, but he is like him: *he* said, It is I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They said therefore to him, How have thine eyes been opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered [and said], A man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They said therefore to him, Where is he? He says, I do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Pharisees therefore also again asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put mud upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some of the Pharisees therefore said, This man is not of God, for he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man perform such signs? And there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say therefore again to the blind [man], What dost thou say of him, that he has opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and had received sight, until they had called the parents of him that had received sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they asked them saying, This is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind: how then does he now see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered [them] and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but how he now sees we do not know, or who has opened his eyes we do not know. *He* is of age: ask *him*; *he* will speak concerning himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him [to be the] Christ, he should be excommunicated from the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On this account his parents said, He is of age: ask *him*.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I know, that, being blind [before], now I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they said to him again, What did he do to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them, I told you already and ye did not hear: why do ye desire to hear again? do ye also wish to become his disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God spoke to Moses; but [as to] this [man], we know not whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered and said to them, Now in this is a wonderful thing, that *ye* do not know whence he is, and he has opened mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>[But] we know that God does not hear sinners; but if any one be God-fearing and do his will, him he hears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Since time was, it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this [man] were not of God he would be able to do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not may see, and they which see may become blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And [some] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, Are we blind also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, If ye were blind ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see, your sin remains.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
