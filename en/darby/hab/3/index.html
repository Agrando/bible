Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make [it] known: In wrath remember mercy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And [his] brightness was as the light; Rays [came forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Before him went the pestilence, And a burning flame went forth at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and discomfited the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered, The everlasting hills gave way: His ways are everlasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Was Jehovah wrathful with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers? Was thy rage against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Thy chariots of salvation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thy bow was made naked, The rods [of discipline] sworn according to [thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The mountains saw thee, they were in travail: Torrents of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, Lifted up its hands on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows which shot forth, At the shining of thy glittering spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thou didst march through the land in indignation, Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou didst smite off the head from the house of the wicked, Laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou didst strike through with his own spears the head of his leaders: They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me, Whose exulting was as to devour the afflicted secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, The heap of great waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I heard, and my belly trembled; My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place, That I might rest in the day of distress, When their invader shall come up against the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For though the fig-tree shall not blossom, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labour of the olive-tree shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength, And he maketh my feet like hinds' [feet], And he will make me to walk upon my high places. To the chief Musician. On my stringed instruments.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
