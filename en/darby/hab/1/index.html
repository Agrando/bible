I cry out unto thee, Violence! and thou dost not save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Why dost thou cause me to see iniquity, and lookest thou upon grievance? For spoiling and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore the law is powerless, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked encompasseth the righteous; therefore judgment goeth forth perverted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>See ye among the nations, and behold, and wonder marvellously; for [I] work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be declared [to you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and impetuous nation, which marcheth through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And their horses are swifter than the leopards, and are more agile than the evening wolves; and their horsemen prance proudly, and their horsemen come from afar: they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They come all of them for violence: the crowd of their faces is forwards, and they gather captives as the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a scorn unto him; he derideth every stronghold: for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then will his mind change, and he will pass on, and become guilty: this his power is become his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Art thou not from everlasting, Jehovah my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast appointed him for correction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>[Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on mischief: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, [and] keepest silence when the wicked swalloweth up a [man] more righteous than he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He taketh up all of them with the hook, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them into his drag; therefore he rejoiceth and is glad:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; for by them his portion is become fat, and his meat dainty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall he therefore empty his net, and not spare to slay the nations continually?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
