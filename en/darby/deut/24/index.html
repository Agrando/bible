or if the latter husband die who took her as his wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>her first husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for it is an abomination before Jehovah; and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When a man hath newly taken a wife, he shall not go out with the army, neither shall any kind of business be imposed upon him; he shall be free for his house one year, and shall gladden his wife whom he hath taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No man shall take the hand-mill or the upper millstone in pledge; for it would be taking life in pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man be found who hath stolen one of his brethren of the children of Israel, and who hath treated him as a slave and sold him, that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from thy midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou take great heed, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them shall ye take heed to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what Jehovah thy God did unto Miriam on the way, after that ye came forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When thou dost lend thy brother anything, thou shalt not go into his house to secure his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thou shalt stand outside, and the man to whom thou hast made a loan shall bring out the pledge to thee without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if the man be needy, thou shalt not lie down with his pledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>in any case thou shalt return him the pledge at the going down of the sun, that he may sleep in his own upper garment and bless thee; and it shall be righteousness unto thee before Jehovah thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant [who is] poor and needy of thy brethren, or of thy sojourners who are in thy land within thy gates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>on his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and his soul yearneth after it; lest he cry against thee to Jehovah, and it be a sin in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The fathers shall not be put to death for the sons, neither shall the sons be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, [or] of the fatherless; and thou shalt not take in pledge a widow's garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and that Jehovah thy God redeemed thee from thence; therefore I command thee to do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When thou reapest thy harvest in thy field, and forgettest a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not return to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Jehovah thy God may bless thee in all the work of thy hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When thou shakest thine olive-tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterwards; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
