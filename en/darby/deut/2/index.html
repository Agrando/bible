He hath known thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years hath Jehovah thy God been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, by the plain, by Elath, and by Ezion-geber, and we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither engage with them in battle; for I will not give thee of their land a possession; for unto the children of Lot have I given Ar as a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>(The Emim dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They also are reckoned as giants like the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in Seir dwelt the Horites in times past; and the children of Esau dispossessed them, and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of their possession, which Jehovah gave to them.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now rise up, and pass over the torrent Zered. And we passed over the torrent Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we had come over the torrent Zered, were thirty-eight years; until the whole generation of the men of war was consumed from the midst of the camp, as Jehovah had sworn unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover the hand of Jehovah was against them to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed, having died off from among the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that Jehovah spoke to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou art to pass this day over the border of Moab, [which is] Ar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and come near over against the children of Ammon; thou shalt not distress them nor attack them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon a possession; for unto the children of Lot have I given it as a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(That also is reckoned a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in time past, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>a people great, and many, and tall as the Anakim; and Jehovah destroyed them before them, and they dispossessed them, and dwelt in their stead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>as he did to the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, from before whom he destroyed the Horites; and they dispossessed them, and dwelt in their stead, even to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Avvites who dwelt in the hamlets as far as Gazah the Caphtorim, who came out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon.
