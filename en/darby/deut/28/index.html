for she shall secretly eat them for want of everything in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If thou wilt not take heed to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, to fear this glorious and fearful name, JEHOVAH THY GOD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>then Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, great and persistent plagues and evil and persistent sicknesses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt which thou art afraid of, and they shall cleave unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law, them will Jehovah bring upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And ye shall be left a small company, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah thy God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it shall come to pass, that as Jehovah rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you, so Jehovah will rejoice over you to cause you to perish, and to destroy you; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whereunto thou goest to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And Jehovah will scatter thee among all peoples, from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth; and thou shalt there serve other gods, whom thou hast not known, neither thou nor thy fathers, wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And among these nations shalt thou have no rest, neither shall the sole of thy foot have a resting-place, and Jehovah shall give thee there a trembling heart, languishing of the eyes, and pining of the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And thy life shall hang in suspense before thee; and thou shalt be in terror day and night and shalt be afraid of thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>In the morning thou shalt say, Would that it were even! and in the evening thou shalt say, Would that it were morning! through the fright of thy heart wherewith thou shalt be in terror, and through the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And Jehovah will bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way whereof I said unto thee, Thou shalt see it again no more; and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and there shall be no man to buy [you].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
