for in the month of Abib Jehovah thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And thou shalt sacrifice the passover to Jehovah thy God, of the flock and of the herd, in the place which Jehovah will choose to cause his name to dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Thou shalt eat no leavened bread along with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread with it, bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste, that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt, all the days of thy life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all thy borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst at even on the first day, be left over night until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover in one of thy gates, which Jehovah thy God giveth thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but at the place that Jehovah thy God will choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the time that thou camest forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thou shalt cook and eat it at the place which Jehovah thy God will choose; and in the morning shalt thou turn and go unto thy tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day is a solemn assembly to Jehovah thy God; thou shalt do no work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Seven weeks shalt thou count: from the beginning of putting the sickle into the corn shalt thou begin to count seven weeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And thou shalt hold the feast of weeks to Jehovah thy God with a tribute of a voluntary-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give, according as Jehovah thy God hath blessed thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and thou shalt rejoice before Jehovah thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy bondman, and thy handmaid, and the Levite that is in thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow that are in thy midst in the place that Jehovah thy God will choose to cause his name to dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and thou shalt keep and do these statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The feast of tabernacles shalt thou hold seven days, when thou hast gathered in [the produce] of thy floor and of thy winepress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy bondman, and thy handmaid, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are in thy gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days shalt thou hold a feast to Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah will choose;

thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a bribe; for the bribe blindeth the eyes of the wise, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Perfect justice shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and possess the land that Jehovah thy God giveth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shalt not plant thyself an Asherah of any wood near unto the altar of Jehovah thy God, which thou shalt make thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Neither shalt thou set thee up a statue, which Jehovah thy God hateth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
