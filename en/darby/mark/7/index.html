Do ye not perceive that all that is outside entering into the man cannot defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because it does not enter into his heart but into his belly, and goes out into the draught, purging all meats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, That which goes forth out of the man, that defiles the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>thefts, covetousness, wickednesses, deceit, licentiousness, a wicked eye, injurious language, haughtiness, folly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>all these wicked things go forth from within and defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he rose up and went away thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and having entered into a house he would not have any one know [it], and he could not be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But immediately a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell at his feet</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>(and the woman was a Greek, Syrophenician by race), and asked him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But [Jesus] said to her, Suffer the children to be first filled; for it is not right to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But she answered and says to him, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to her, Because of this word, go thy way, the demon is gone out of thy daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And having gone away to her house she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again having left the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they bring to him a deaf [man] who could not speak right, and they beseech him that he might lay his hand on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers to his ears; and having spit, he touched his tongue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and looking up to heaven he groaned, and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And immediately his ears were opened, and the band of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he charged them that they should speak to no one [of it]. But so much the more *he* charged them, so much the more abundantly *they* proclaimed it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they were astonished above measure, saying, He does all things well; he makes both the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
