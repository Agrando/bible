But they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And looking round upon them with anger, distressed at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea and beyond the Jordan; and they of around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what things he did, came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke to his disciples, in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd, that they might not press upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he healed many, so that they beset him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried saying, *Thou* art the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he rebuked them much, that they might not make him manifest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, and they went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have power [to heal diseases, and] to cast out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he gave to Simon the surname of Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he gave them the surname of Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariote, who also delivered him up. And they come to [the] house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again a crowd comes together, so that they cannot even eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his relatives having heard [of it] went out to lay hold on him, for they said, He is out of his mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having called them to [him], he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if a kingdom has become divided against itself, that kingdom cannot subsist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if a house has become divided against itself, that house cannot subsist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan rise up against himself, and is divided, he cannot subsist, but has an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But no one can, having entered into his house, plunder the goods of the strong [man] unless he first bind the strong [man], and then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Verily I say unto you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and all the injurious speeches [with] which they may speak injuriously;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but whosoever shall speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit, to eternity has no forgiveness; but lies under the guilt of an everlasting sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his brethren and his mother come, and standing without sent to him calling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And a crowd sat around him.
