And a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that going on board ship he sat in the sea, and all the crowd were close to the sea on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he taught them many things in parables. And he said to them in his doctrine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass as he sowed, one fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And another fell on the rocky ground, where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprung up out [of the ground] because it had no depth of earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and when the sun arose it was burnt up, and because of its not having any root, it withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and bore, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he was alone, those about him with the twelve asked him [as to] the parables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, To you is given [to know] the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to them who are without, all things are done in parables,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that beholding they may behold and not see, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest it may be, they should be converted and they should be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he says to them, Do ye not know this parable? and how will ye be acquainted with all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower sows the word:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and these are they by the wayside where the word is sown, and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these are they in like manner who are sown upon the rocky places, who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they have no root in themselves, but are for a time: then, tribulation arising, or persecution on account of the word, immediately they are offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And others are they who are sown among the thorns: these are they who have heard the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the cares of life, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things, entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And these are they who have been sown on the good ground, such as hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit; one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred [fold].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to them, Does the lamp come that it should be put under the bushel or under the couch? [Is it] not that it should be set upon the lamp-stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest; nor does any secret thing take place, but that it should come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear; with what measure ye mete, it shall be meted to you; and there shall be [more] added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whosoever has, to him shall be given; and he who has not, even what he has shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast the seed upon the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep and rise up night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he does not know how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The earth bears fruit of itself, first [the] blade, then an ear, then full corn in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit is produced, immediately he sends the sickle, for the harvest is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, How should we liken the kingdom of God, or with what comparison should we compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As to a grain of mustard [seed], which, when it is sown upon the earth, is less than all seeds which are upon the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and when it has been sown, mounts up and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shadow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but without a parable spoke he not to them; and in private he explained all things to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on that day, when evening was come, he says to them, Let us go over to the other side:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and having sent away the crowd, they take him with [them], as he was, in the ship. But other ships also were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there comes a violent gust of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it already filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And *he* was in the stern sleeping on the cushion. And they awake him up and say to him, Teacher, dost thou not care that we are perishing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And awaking up he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Silence; be mute. And the wind fell, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said to them, Why are ye [thus] fearful? how [is it] ye have not faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared [with] great fear, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
