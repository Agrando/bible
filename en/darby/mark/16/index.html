Ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, the crucified one. He is risen, he is not here; behold the place where they had put him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they went out, and fled from the sepulchre. And trembling and excessive amazement possessed them, and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when he had risen very early, the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>*She* went and brought word to those that had been with him, [who were] grieving and weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when these heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, they disbelieved [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and *they* went and brought word to the rest; neither did they believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven, and reproached [them with] their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that believes and is baptised shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these signs shall follow those that have believed: in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word by the signs following upon [it].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
