And he answered and said to him, *Thou* sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the chief priests accused him urgently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? See of how many things they bear witness against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marvelled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But at [the] feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they begged [of him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now there was the [person] named Barabbas bound with those who had made insurrection with [him], [and] that had committed murder in the insurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the crowd crying out began to beg [that he would do] to them as he had always done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Pilate answered them saying, Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up through envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that he might rather release Barabbas to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Pilate answering said to them again, What will ye then that I do [to him] whom ye call King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cried out again, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Pilate said to them, What evil then has he done? But they cried out the more urgently, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Pilate, desirous of contenting the crowd, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, that he might be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers led him away into the court which is [called the] praetorium, and they call together the whole band.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothe him with purple, and bind round on him a crown of thorns which they had plaited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and, bending the knee, did him homage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own clothes on him; and they lead him out that they may crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they compel to go [with them] a certain passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might carry his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they bring him to the place [called] Golgotha, which, being interpreted, is Place of a skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they offered him wine [to drink] medicated with myrrh; but he did not take [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having crucified him, they part his clothes amongst [themselves], casting lots on them, what each one should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the superscription of what he was accused of was written up: The King of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And with him they crucify two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>[And the scripture was fulfilled which says, And he was reckoned with the lawless.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and saying, Aha, thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>save thyself, and descend from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In like manner the chief priests also, with the scribes, mocking with one another, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and may believe.
