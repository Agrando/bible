And straightway on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there was in their synagogue a man [possessed] by an unclean spirit, and he cried out</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Eh! what have we to do with thee, Jesus, Nazarene? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy one of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the unclean spirit, having torn him, and uttered a cry with a loud voice, came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And all were amazed, so that they questioned together among themselves, saying, What is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And his fame went out straightway into the whole region of Galilee around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And straightway going out of the synagogue, they came with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the mother-in-law of Simon lay in a fever. And straightway they speak to him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he went up to [her] and raised her up, having taken her by the hand, and straightway the fever left her, and she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But evening being come, when the sun had gone down, they brought to him all that were suffering, and those possessed by demons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the whole city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many suffering from various diseases; and he cast out many demons, and did not suffer the demons to speak because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And rising in the morning long before day, he went out and went away into a desert place, and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and those with him went after him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and having found him, they say to him, All seek thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the neighbouring country towns, that I may preach there also, for for this purpose am I come forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he was preaching in their synagogues in the whole of Galilee, and casting out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there comes to him a leper, beseeching him, and falling on his knees to him, and saying to him, If thou wilt thou canst cleanse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But Jesus, moved with compassion, having stretched out his hand, touched him, and says to him, I will, be thou cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as he spoke straightway the leprosy left him, and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And having sharply charged him, he straightway sent him away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and says to him, See thou say nothing to any one, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses ordained, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he, having gone forth, began to proclaim [it] much, and to spread the matter abroad, so that he could no longer enter openly into the city, but was without in desert places, and they came to him from every side.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
