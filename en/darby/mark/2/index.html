Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And straightway Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven [thee]; or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he rose up straightway, and, having taken up his couch, went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he went out again by the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And passing by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office, and says to him, Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with sinners and tax-gatherers, said to his disciples, Why [is it] that he eats and drinks with tax-gatherers and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus having heard [it] says to them, They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those who are ill. I have not come to call righteous [men], but sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and [the disciples] of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then shall they fast in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment: otherwise its new filling-up takes from the old [stuff], and there is a worse rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no one puts new wine into old skins; otherwise the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine is to be put into new skins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And *he* said to them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, *he* and those with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>how he entered into the house of God, in [the section of] Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
