Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I wonder that ye thus quickly change, from him that called you in Christ's grace, to a different gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>which is not another [one]; but there are some that trouble you, and desire to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if even *we* or an angel out of heaven announce as glad tidings to you [anything] besides what we have announced as glad tidings to you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, now also again I say, If any one announce to you as glad tidings [anything] besides what ye have received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For do I now seek to satisfy men or God? or do I seek to please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ's bondman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I let you know, brethren, [as to] the glad tidings which were announced by me, that they are not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For neither did I receive them from man, neither was I taught [them], but by revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For ye have heard [what was] my conversation formerly in Judaism, that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and advanced in Judaism beyond many [my] contemporaries in my nation, being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when God, who set me apart [even] from my mother's womb, and called [me] by his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not counsel with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor went I up to Jerusalem to those [who were] apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but I saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea which [are] in Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he ravaged:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
