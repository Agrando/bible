for I bear you witness that, if possible, plucking out your own eyes ye would have given [them] to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So I have become your enemy in speaking the truth to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are not rightly zealous after you, but desire to shut you out [from us], that ye may be zealous after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But [it is] right to be zealous at all times in what is right, and not only when I am present with you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>my children, of whom I again travail in birth until Christ shall have been formed in you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and I should wish to be present with you now, and change my voice, for I am perplexed as to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, ye who are desirous of being under law, do ye not listen to the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons; one of the maid servant, and one of the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he [that was] of the maid servant was born according to flesh, and he [that was] of the free woman through the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things have an allegorical sense; for these are two covenants: one from mount Sinai, gendering to bondage, which is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which [is] now, for she is in bondage with her children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break out and cry, thou that travailest not; because the children of the desolate are more numerous than [those] of her that has a husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But *ye*, brethren, after the pattern of Isaac, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him [that was born] according to Spirit, so also [it is] now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what says the scripture? Cast out the maid servant and her son; for the son of the maid servant shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brethren, we are not maid servant's children, but [children] of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
