Far be the thought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the things I have thrown down, these I build again, I constitute myself a transgressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For *I*, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, *I*, but Christ lives in me; but [in] that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness [is] by law, then Christ has died for nothing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
