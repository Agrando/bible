For it is written, Cursed is every one who does not continue in all things which [are] written in the book of the law to do them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>but that by law no one is justified with God [is] evident, because The just shall live on the principle of faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but the law is not on the principle of faith; but, He that shall have done these things shall live by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed [is] every one hanged upon a tree,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brethren, (I speak according to man,) even man's confirmed covenant no one sets aside, or adds other dispositions to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to Abraham were the promises addressed, and to his seed: he does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed; which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now I say this, A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which took place four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance [be] on the principle of law, [it is] no longer on the principle of promise; but God gave it in grace to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then the law? It was added for the sake of transgressions, until the seed came to whom the promise was made, ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But a mediator is not of one, but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[Is] then the law against the promises of God? Far be the thought. For if a law had been given able to quicken, then indeed righteousness were on the principle of law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but the scripture has shut up all things under sin, that the promise, on the principle of faith of Jesus Christ, should be given to those that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were guarded under law, shut up to faith [which was] about to be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So that the law has been our tutor up to Christ, that we might be justified on the principle of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but if *ye* [are] of Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
