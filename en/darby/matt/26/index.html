And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that time he sought a good opportunity that he might deliver him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now on the first [day] of [the feast of] unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Go into the city unto such a one, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near, I will keep the passover in thy house with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as they were eating he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And being exceedingly grieved they began to say to him, each of them, Is it *I*, Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answering said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, *he* it is who shall deliver me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of man goes indeed, according as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up; it were good for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Judas, who delivered him up, answering said, Is it *I*, Rabbi? He says to him, *Thou* hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken [the] bread and blessed, broke [it] and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And having taken [the] cup and given thanks, he gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this is my blood, that of the [new] covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I say to you, that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then saith Jesus to them, All *ye* shall be offended in me during this night. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after that I shall be risen, I will go before you to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Peter answering said to him, If all shall be offended in thee, *I* will never be offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that during this night, before [the] cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter says to him, If I should needs die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. Likewise said all the disciples also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here until I go away and pray yonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And taking with [him] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he says to them, My soul is very sorrowful even unto death; remain here and watch with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going forward a little he fell upon his face, praying and saying, My Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not as *I* will, but as *thou* [wilt].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] ready, but the flesh weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again going away a second time he prayed saying, My Father, if this cannot pass [from me] unless I drink it, thy will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And coming he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, Sleep on now and take your rest; behold, the hour has drawn nigh, and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is: seize him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And immediately coming up to Jesus he said, Hail, Rabbi, and covered him with kisses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus said to him, [My] friend, for what purpose art thou come? Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then saith Jesus to him, Return thy sword to its place; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Or thinkest thou that I cannot now call upon my Father, and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me? I sat daily [with you] teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now they that had seized Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Peter followed him at a distance, even to the palace of the high priest, and entering in sat with the officers to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrim sought false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But at the last two false witnesses came forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said, *He* said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days build it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest standing up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if *thou* art the Christ the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus says to him, *Thou* hast said. Moreover, I say to you, From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has blasphemed: what need have we any more of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What think ye? And they answering said, He is liable to the penalty of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and some struck him with the palms of their hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ, Who is it who struck thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But Peter sat without in the palace-court; and a maid came to him, saying, And *thou* wast with Jesus the Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he had gone out into the entrance, another [maid] saw him, and says to those there, This [man] also was with Jesus the Nazaraean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with an oath: I do not know the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a little, those who stood [there], coming to [him], said to Peter, Truly *thou* too art of them, for also thy speech makes thee manifest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately [the] cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said [to him], Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went forth without, and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
