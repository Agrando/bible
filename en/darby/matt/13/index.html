but he who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But blessed are *your* eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see the things which ye behold and did not see [them], and to hear the things which ye hear and did not hear [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>*Ye*, therefore, hear the parable of the sower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [it], the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart: this is he that is sown by the wayside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he that is sown on the rocky places this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but has no root in himself, but is for a time only; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word, he is immediately offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he that is sown among the thorns this is he who hears the word, and the anxious care of this life, and the deceit of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he that is sown upon the good ground this is he who hears and understands the word, who bears fruit also, and produces, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the blade shot up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him, Sir, hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? whence then has it darnel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, A man [that is] an enemy has done this. And the bondmen said to him, Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [up]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said, No; lest [in] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest, and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen, Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and sowed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>which is less indeed than all seeds, but when it is grown is greater than herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from [the] world's foundation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Thus shall it be in the completion of the age: the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, [Lord].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [that is] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he withdrew thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence has this [man] this wisdom and these works of power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brethren James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then has this [man] all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they were offended in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, unless in his country and in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not there many works of power, because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
