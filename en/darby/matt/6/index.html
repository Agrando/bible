Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But thou, when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand does;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>so that thine alms may be in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will render [it] to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets so that they should appear to men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But *thou*, when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and having shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret, and thy Father who sees in secret will render [it] to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as those who are of the nations: for they think they shall be heard through their much speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be not ye therefore like them, for your Father knows of what things ye have need before ye beg [anything] of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus therefore pray *ye*: Our Father who art in the heavens, let thy name be sanctified,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>let thy kingdom come, let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>give us to-day our needed bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and lead us not into temptation, but save us from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if ye forgive men their offences, your heavenly Father also will forgive you [yours],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if ye do not forgive men their offences, neither will your Father forgive your offences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, downcast in countenance; for they disfigure their faces, so that they may appear fasting to men: verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But *thou*, [when] fasting, anoint thy head and wash thy face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so that thou mayest not appear fasting unto men, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who sees in secret shall render [it] to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust spoils, and where thieves dig through and steal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust spoils, and where thieves do not dig through nor steal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for where thy treasure is, there will be also thy heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but if thine eye be wicked, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great the darkness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and will love the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For this cause I say unto you, Do not be careful about your life, what ye should eat and what ye should drink; nor for your body what ye should put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Look at the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into granaries, and your heavenly Father nourishes them. Are *ye* not much more excellent than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But which of you by carefulness can add to his growth one cubit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why are ye careful about clothing? Observe with attention the lilies of the field, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but I say unto you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed as one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if God so clothe the herbage of the field, which is to-day, and to-morrow is cast into [the] oven, will he not much rather you, O [ye] of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Be not therefore careful, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we put on?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for all these things the nations seek after; for your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Be not careful therefore for the morrow, for the morrow shall be careful about itself. Sufficient to the day [is] its own evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
