And the crowds having heard [of it] followed him on foot from the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And going out he saw a great crowd, and was moved with compassion about them, and healed their infirm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when even was come, his disciples came to him saying, The place is desert, and [much of] the [day] time already gone by; dismiss the crowds, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give *ye* them to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But they say to him, We have not here save five loaves and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Bring them here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed: and having broken the loaves, he gave [them] to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all ate and were filled, and they took up what was over and above of fragments twelve hand-baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But those that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side, until he should have dismissed the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having dismissed the crowds, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when even was come, he was alone there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but the ship was already in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition. And they cried out through fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is *I*: be not afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be *thou*, command me to come to thee upon the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said, Come. And Peter, having descended from the ship, walked upon the waters to go to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they had gone up into the ship, the wind fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But those in the ship came and did homage to him, saying, Truly thou art God's Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the men of that place recognised him, they sent to that whole country around, and they brought to him all that were ill,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made thoroughly well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
