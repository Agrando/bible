And they went their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again, having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But about the eleventh [hour], having gone out, he found others standing, and says to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He says to them, Go also ye into the vineyard [and whatsoever may be just ye shall receive].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But when the evening was come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen and pay [them] their wages, beginning from the last even to the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when they [who came to work] about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more, and they received also themselves each a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And on receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, These last have worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answering said to one of them, [My] friend, I do not wrong thee. Didst thou not agree with me for a denarius?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take what is thine and go. But it is my will to give to this last even as to thee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs? Is thine eye evil because *I* am good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called ones, but few chosen ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples with [him] apart in the way, and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and they will deliver him up to the nations to mock and to scourge and to crucify, and the third day he shall rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, doing homage, and asking something of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to her, What wilt thou? She says to him, Speak [the word] that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand and one on thy left in thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup which *I* am about to drink? They say to him, We are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>[And] he says to them, Ye shall drink indeed my cup, but to sit on my right hand and on [my] left, is not mine to give, but to those for whom it is prepared of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the ten, having heard [of it], were indignant about the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus having called them to [him], said, Ye know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them, and the great exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It shall not be thus amongst you, but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and whosoever will be first among you, let him be your bondman;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>as indeed the Son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as they went out from Jericho a great crowd followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And lo, two blind men, sitting by the wayside, having heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the crowd rebuked them, that they might be silent. But they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus, having stopped, called them and said, What will ye that I shall do to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes had sight restored to them, and they followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
