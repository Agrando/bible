What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a letter of divorce and to send [her] away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He says to them, Moses, in view of your hardheartedness, allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, not for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and he who marries one put away commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples say to him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, All cannot receive this word, but those to whom it has been given;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for there are eunuchs which have been born thus from [their] mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs of men; and there are eunuchs who have made eunuchs of themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then there were brought to him little children that he might lay his hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and do not hinder them from coming to me; for the kingdom of the heavens is of such:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and having laid his hands upon them, he departed thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And lo, one coming up said to him, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have life eternal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, What askest thou me concerning goodness? one is good. But if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Honour thy father and thy mother, and Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man says to him, All these have I kept; what lack I yet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell what thou hast and give to [the] poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the young man, having heard the word, went away grieved, for he had large possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus said to his disciples, Verily I say unto you, A rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to enter a needle's eye than a rich man into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when the disciples heard [it] they were exceedingly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus, looking on [them], said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter answering said to him, Behold, *we* have left all things and have followed thee; what then shall happen to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus said to them, Verily I say unto you, That *ye* who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit down upon his throne of glory, *ye* also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And every one who has left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many first shall be last, and last first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
