Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly and say to his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and behold, he goes before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him. Behold, I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring his disciples word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they went to bring his disciples word, behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail! And they coming up took him by the feet, and did him homage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus says to them, Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as they went, behold, some of the watch went into the city, and brought word to the chief priests of all that had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And having assembled with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, Say that his disciples coming by night stole him [while] we [were] sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this should come to the hearing of the governor, *we* will persuade him, and save *you* from all anxiety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they took the money and did as they had been taught. And this report is current among the Jews until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the eleven disciples went into Galilee to the mountain which Jesus had appointed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him, they did homage to him: but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus coming up spoke to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go [therefore] and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined you.
