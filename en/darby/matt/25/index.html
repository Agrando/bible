Go rather to those that sell, and buy for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But as they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and the [ones that were] ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterwards come also the rest of the virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but he answering said, Verily I say unto you, I do not know you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For [it is] as [if] a man going away out of a country called his own bondmen and delivered to them his substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to each according to his particular ability, and immediately went away out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he that had received the five talents went and trafficked with them, and made five other talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In like manner also he that [had received] the two, [he also] gained two others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he that had received the one went and dug in the earth, and hid the money of his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes and reckons with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he that had received the five talents came to [him] and brought five other talents, saying, [My] lord, thou deliveredst me five talents; behold, I have gained five other talents besides them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman, thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he also that had received the two talents came to [him] and said, [My] lord, thou deliveredst me two talents; behold, I have gained two other talents besides them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman, thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he also that had received the one talent coming to [him] said, [My] lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hadst not sowed, and gathering from where thou hadst not scattered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and being afraid I went away and hid thy talent in the earth; behold, thou hast that which is thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And his lord answering said to him, Wicked and slothful bondman, thou knewest that I reap where I had not sowed, and gather from where I had not scattered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>thou oughtest then to have put my money to the money-changers, and when I came I should have got what is mine with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that has the ten talents:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for to every one that has shall be given, and he shall be in abundance; but from him that has not, that even which he has shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And cast out the useless bondman into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit down upon his throne of glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and all the nations shall be gathered before him; and he shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and he will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on [his] left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from [the] world's foundation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for I hungered, and ye gave me to eat; I thirsted, and ye gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>naked, and ye clothed me; I was ill, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then shall the righteous answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, and nourished thee; or thirsting, and gave thee to drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in; or naked, and clothed thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and when saw we thee ill, or in prison, and came to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King answering shall say to them, Verily, I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then shall he say also to those on the left, Go from me, cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for I hungered, and ye gave me not to eat; I thirsted, and ye gave me not to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye did not clothe me; ill, and in prison, and ye did not visit me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then shall *they* also answer saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and have not ministered to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then shall he answer them saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have not done it to one of these least, neither have ye done it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And these shall go away into eternal punishment, and the righteous into life eternal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
