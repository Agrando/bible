And his disciples came to [him] and asked him, saying, Dismiss her, for she cries after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he answering said, I have not been sent save to the lost sheep of Israel's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But she came and did him homage, saying, Lord, help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he answering said, It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, thy faith [is] great. Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed from *that* hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus, going away from thence, came towards the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and sat down there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and great crowds came to him, having with them lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others, and they cast them at his feet, and he healed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that the crowds wondered, seeing dumb speaking, crippled sound, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Jesus, having called his disciples to [him], said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat, and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in [the] wilderness as to satisfy so great a crowd?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? But they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he commanded the crowds to lie down on the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having given thanks, he broke [them] and gave [them] to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And all ate and were filled; and they took up what was over and above of the fragments seven baskets full;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but they that ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And, having dismissed the crowds, he went on board ship and came to the borders of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
