But he that has endured to [the] end, *he* shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when they persecute you in this city, flee to the other; for verily I say to you, Ye shall not have completed the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the bondman above his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>[It is] sufficient for the disciple that he should become as his teacher, and the bondman as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more those of his household?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Fear them not therefore; for there is nothing covered which shall not be revealed, and secret which shall not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What I say to you in darkness speak in the light, and what ye hear in the ear preach upon the houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And be not afraid of those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul; but fear rather him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall to the ground without your Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but of you even the hairs of the head are all numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Fear not therefore; *ye* are better than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Every one therefore who shall confess me before men, *I* also will confess him before my Father who is in [the] heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will *I* also deny before my Father who is in [the] heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Do not think that I have come to send peace upon the earth: I have not come to send peace, but a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I have come to set a man at variance with his father, and the daughter with her mother, and the daughter-in-law with her mother-in-law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and they of his household [shall be] a man's enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He who loves father or mother above me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter above me is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he who does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He that finds his life shall lose it, and he who has lost his life for my sake shall find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a righteous man's reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whosoever shall give to drink to one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
