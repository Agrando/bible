It is no longer fit for anything but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>*Ye* are the light of the world: a city situated on the top of a mountain cannot be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor do [men] light a lamp and put it under the bushel, but upon the lamp-stand, and it shines for all who are in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your light thus shine before men, so that they may see your upright works, and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Think not that I am come to make void the law or the prophets; I am not come to make void, but to fulfil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For verily I say unto you, Until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whosoever then shall do away with one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whosoever shall practise and teach [them], *he* shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say unto you, that unless your righteousness surpass [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill; but whosoever shall kill shall be subject to the judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But *I* say unto you, that every one that is lightly angry with his brother shall be subject to the judgment; but whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be subject to [be called before] the sanhedrim; but whosoever shall say, Fool, shall be subject to the penalty of the hell of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar, and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave there thy gift before the altar, and first go, be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Make friends with thine adverse party quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him; lest some time the adverse party deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Verily I say to thee, Thou shalt in no wise come out thence till thou hast paid the last farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But *I* say unto you, that every one who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But if thy right eye be a snare to thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if thy right hand be a snare to thee, cut it off and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It has been said too, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a letter of divorce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But *I* say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except for cause of fornication, makes her commit adultery, and whosoever marries one that is put away commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Again, ye have heard that it has been said to the ancients, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt render to the Lord what thou hast sworn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But *I* say unto you, Do not swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is [the] throne of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, because it is [the] footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is [the] city of the great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your word be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; but what is more than these is from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ye have heard that it has been said, Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But *I* say unto you, not to resist evil; but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and to him that would go to law with thee and take thy body coat, leave him thy cloak also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whoever will compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>To him that asks of thee give, and from him that desires to borrow of thee turn not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But *I* say unto you, Love your enemies, [bless those who curse you,] do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who [insult you and] persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>that ye may be [the] sons of your Father who is in [the] heavens; for he makes his sun rise on evil and good, and sends rain on just and unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if ye should love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if ye should salute your brethren only, what do ye extraordinary? Do not also the Gentiles the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Be *ye* therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
