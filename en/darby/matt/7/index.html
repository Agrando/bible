Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or what man is there of you who, if his son shall ask of him a loaf of bread, will give him a stone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if he ask a fish, will give him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore *ye*, being wicked, know [how] to give good gifts to your children, how much rather shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to them that ask of him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore all things whatever ye desire that men should do to you, thus do *ye* also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction, and many are they who enter in through it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For narrow the gate and straitened the way that leads to life, and they are few who find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but within are ravening wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By their fruits ye shall know them. Do [men] gather a bunch of grapes from thorns, or from thistles figs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So every good tree produces good fruits, but the worthless tree produces bad fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot produce bad fruits, nor a worthless tree produce good fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By their fruits then surely ye shall know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Not every one who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he that does the will of my Father who is in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many shall say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied through *thy* name, and through *thy* name cast out demons, and through *thy* name done many works of power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and then will I avow unto them, I never knew you. Depart from me, workers of lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whoever therefore hears these my words and does them, I will liken him to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the rain came down, and the streams came, and the winds blew and fell upon that house, and it did not fall, for it had been founded upon the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And every one who hears these my words and does not do them, he shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the rain came down, and the streams came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell, and its fall was great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his doctrine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he taught them as having authority, and not as their scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
