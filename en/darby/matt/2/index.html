And having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And being divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now, they having departed, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take to [thee] the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, having arisen, he took to [him] the little child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he was there until the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the magi, was greatly enraged; and sent and slew all the boys which [were] in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time which he had accurately inquired from the magi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A voice has been heard in Rama, weeping, and great lamentation: Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Herod having died, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Arise, take to [thee] the little child and its mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they who sought the life of the little child are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he arose and took to [him] the little child and its mother, and came into the land of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but having heard that 'Archelaus reigns over Judaea, instead of Herod his father,' he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he went away into the parts of Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth; so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, He shall be called a Nazaraean.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
