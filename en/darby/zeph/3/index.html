Every morning doth he bring his judgment to light; it faileth not: but the unrighteous knoweth no shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have cut off nations: their battlements are desolate; I made their streets waste, that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I said, Only fear me, receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, howsoever I may punish her. But they rose early, they corrupted all their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to assemble the nations, that I may gather the kingdoms together, to pour upon them mine indignation, all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From beyond the rivers of Cush my suppliants, the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine oblation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that exult in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The remnant of Israel shall not work unrighteousness, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: but *they* shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Exult, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; rejoice and be glad with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy; the King of Israel, Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not see evil any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear not; Zion, let not thy hands be slack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jehovah thy God is in thy midst, a mighty one that will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will exult over thee with singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assemblies, who were of thee: the reproach of it was a burden [unto them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save her that halted, and gather her that was driven out; and I will make them a praise and a name in all the lands where they have been put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At that time will I bring you, yea, at the time that I gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise, among all the peoples of the earth, when I shall turn again your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
