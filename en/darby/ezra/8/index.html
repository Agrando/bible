and there we encamped three days; and I surveyed the people and the priests, and found none of the sons of Levi there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I sent for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men, and for Joiarib and for Elnathan, men of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I gave them a commission to Iddo the chief, at the place Casiphia, and I put words in their mouths to say to Iddo [and] his brethren the Nethinim, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring to us ministers for the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel, namely, Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Hashabiah, and with him Isaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and of the Nethinim, whom David and the princes had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinim: all of them were expressed by name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way; for we had spoken to the king saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his anger is against all them that forsake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And we fasted, and besought our God for this; and he was entreated of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I separated twelve of the chiefs of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I weighed to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the heave-offering for the house of our God, which the king and his counsellors and his princes, and all Israel present, had offered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I weighed into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver;

the vessels also are holy; and the silver and the gold is a voluntary offering to Jehovah the God of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Watch and keep [them] until ye weigh them before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites, and the chiefs of the fathers of Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the priests and the Levites received by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And we departed from the river Ahava on the twelfth of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Urijah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the whole by number and by weight; and all the weight was written down at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The children of those that had been carried away, who had come out of the captivity, presented burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he-goats for a sin-offering: all for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they delivered the king's edicts to the king's satraps, and to the governors on this side the river. And they furthered the people and the house of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
