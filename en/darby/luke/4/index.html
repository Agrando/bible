And they said, Is not this the son of Joseph?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, Ye will surely say to me this parable, Physician, heal thyself; whatsoever we have heard has taken place in Capernaum do here also in thine own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, Verily I say to you, that no prophet is acceptable in his [own] country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But of a truth I say to you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months, so that a great famine came upon all the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and to none of them was Elias sent but to Sarepta of Sidonia, to a woman [that was] a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they were all filled with rage in the synagogue, hearing these things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and rising up they cast him forth out of the city, and led him up to the brow of the mountain upon which their city was built, so that they might throw him down the precipice;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but *he*, passing through the midst of them, went his way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and descended to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonished at his doctrine, for his word was with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there was in the synagogue a man having a spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, Eh! what have we to do with thee, Jesus, Nazarene? hast thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy [One] of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out from him. And the demon, having thrown him down into the midst, came out from him without doing him any injury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And astonishment came upon all, and they spoke to one another, saying, What word [is] this? for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And a rumour went out into every place of the country round concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And rising up out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon. But Simon's mother-in-law was suffering under a bad fever; and they asked him for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And standing over her, he rebuked the fever, and it left her; and forthwith standing up she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when the sun went down, all, as many as had persons sick with divers diseases, brought them to him, and having laid his hands on every one of them, he healed them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and demons also went out from many, crying out and saying, *Thou* art the Son of God. And rebuking them, he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him to be the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when it was day he went out, and went into a desert place, and the crowds sought after him, and came up to him, and [would have] kept him back that he should not go from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But he said to them, I must needs announce the glad tidings of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, for for this I have been sent forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
