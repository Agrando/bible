But he said unto them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Strive with earnestness to enter in through the narrow door, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in and will not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>From the time that the master of the house shall have risen up and shall have shut the door, and ye shall begin to stand without and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he answering shall say to you, I know you not whence ye are:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten in thy presence and drunk, and thou hast taught in our streets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he shall say, I tell you, I do not know you whence ye are; depart from me, all [ye] workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but yourselves cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall come from east and west, and from north and south, and shall lie down at table in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The same hour certain Pharisees came up, saying to him, Get out, and go hence, for Herod is desirous to kill thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said to them, Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and accomplish cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third [day] I am perfected;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but I must needs walk to-day and to-morrow and the [day] following, for it must not be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the [city] that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen her brood under her wings, and ye would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Behold, your house is left unto you; and I say unto you, that ye shall not see me until it come that ye say, Blessed [is] he that comes in the name of [the] Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
