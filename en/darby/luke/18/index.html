But when the Son of man comes, shall he indeed find faith on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke also to some, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and made nothing of all the rest [of men], this parable:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee, standing, prayed thus to himself: God, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice in the week, I tithe everything I gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the tax-gatherer, standing afar off, would not lift up even his eyes to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, O God, have compassion on me, the sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I say unto you, This [man] went down to his house justified rather than that [other]. For every one who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they brought to him also infants that he might touch them, but the disciples when they saw [it] rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus calling them to [him] said, Suffer little children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Verily I say to you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a certain ruler asked him saying, Good teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Jesus had heard this, he said to him, One thing is lacking to thee yet: Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens, and come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he heard this he became very sorrowful, for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when Jesus saw that he became very sorrowful, he said, How difficultly shall those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And those who heard it said, And who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter said, Behold, *we* have left all things and have followed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no one who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive manifold more at this time, and in the coming age life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he took the twelve to [him] and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written of the Son of man by the prophets shall be accomplished;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they have scourged [him] they will kill him; and on the third day he will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they understood nothing of these things. And this word was hidden from them, and they did not know what was said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass when he came into the neighbourhood of Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he heard the crowd passing, he inquired what this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they told him that Jesus the Nazaraean was passing by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he called out saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those [who were] going before rebuked him that he might be silent; but *he* cried out so much the more, Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be led to him. And when he drew nigh he asked him [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him, See: thy faith has healed thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people when they saw [it] gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
