But already, when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent to him friends, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore neither did I count myself worthy to come to thee. But say by a word and my servant shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For *I* also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this [one], Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and he does [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jesus hearing this wondered at him, and turning to the crowd following him said, I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they who had been sent returning to the house found the bondman, who was ill, in good health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass afterwards he went into a city called Nain, and many of his disciples and a great crowd went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she a widow, and a very considerable crowd of the city [was] with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Lord, seeing her, was moved with compassion for her, and said to her, Weep not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and coming up he touched the bier, and the bearers stopped. And he said, Youth, I say to thee, Wake up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the dead sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fear seized on all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has been raised up amongst us; and God has visited his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this report went out in all Judaea concerning him, and in all the surrounding country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of John brought him word concerning all these things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and John, having called two of his disciples, sent to Jesus, saying, Art *thou* he that is coming, or are we to wait for another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the men having come to him said, John the baptist has sent us to thee, saying, Art *thou* he that is coming, or are we to wait for another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour he healed many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and to many blind he granted sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answering said to them, Go, bring back word to John of what ye have seen and heard: that blind see, lame walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf hear, dead are raised, poor are evangelized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and blessed is whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the messengers of John having departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in delicate garments? Behold, those who are in splendid clothing and live luxuriously are in the courts of kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and [what is] more excellent than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is he concerning whom it is written, Behold, *I* send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I say unto you, Among them that are born of women a greater [prophet] is no one than John [the baptist]; but he who is a little one in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(And all the people who heard [it], and the tax-gatherers, justified God, having been baptised with the baptism of John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but the Pharisees and the lawyers rendered null as to themselves the counsel of God, not having been baptised by him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>To whom therefore shall I liken the men of this generation, and to whom are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and ye say, Behold an eater and wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and wisdom has been justified of all her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But one of the Pharisees begged him that he would eat with him. And entering into the house of the Pharisee he took his place at table;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, and knew that he was sitting at meat in the house of the Pharisee, having taken an alabaster box of myrrh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and standing at his feet behind [him] weeping, began to wash his feet with tears; and she wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spoke with himself saying, This [person] if he were a prophet would have known who and what the woman is who touches him, for she is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he says, Teacher, say [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There were two debtors of a certain creditor: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but as they had nothing to pay, he forgave both of them [their debt]: [say,] which of them therefore will love him most?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Simon answering said, I suppose he to whom he forgave the most. And he said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And turning to the woman he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house; thou gavest me not water on my feet, but *she* has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thou gavest me not a kiss, but *she* from the time I came in has not ceased kissing my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>My head with oil thou didst not anoint, but *she* has anointed my feet with myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For which cause I say to thee, Her many sins are forgiven; for she loved much; but he to whom little is forgiven loves little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they that were with [them] at table began to say within themselves, Who is this who forgives also sins?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
