And he divided to them what he was possessed of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after not many days the younger son gathering all together went away into a country a long way off, and there dissipated his property, living in debauchery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when he had spent all there arose a violent famine throughout that country, and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he longed to fill his belly with the husks which the swine were eating; and no one gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have abundance of bread, and *I* perish here by famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am no longer worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he rose up and went to his own father. But while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell upon his neck, and covered him with kisses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his bondmen, Bring out the best robe and clothe him in [it], and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for this my son was dead and has come to life, was lost and has been found. And they began to make merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And his elder son was in the field; and as, coming [up], he drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having called one of the servants, he inquired what these things might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, Thy brother is come, and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he became angry and would not go in. And his father went out and besought him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he answering said to his father, Behold, so many years I serve thee, and never have I transgressed a commandment of thine; and to me hast thou never given a kid that I might make merry with my friends:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but when this thy son, who has devoured thy substance with harlots, is come, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he said to him, Child, *thou* art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But it was right to make merry and rejoice, because this thy brother was dead and has come to life again, and was lost and has been found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
