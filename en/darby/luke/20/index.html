I will send my beloved son: perhaps when they see him they will respect [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; [come,] let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having cast him forth out of the vineyard, they killed [him]. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it they said, May it never be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he looking at them said, What then is this that is written, The stone which they that builded rejected, this has become the corner-stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one falling on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the chief priests and the scribes sought the same hour to lay hands on him, and they feared the people; for they knew that he had spoken this parable of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having watched [him], they sent out suborned persons, pretending to be just men, that they might take hold of him in [his] language, so that they might deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest no [man's] person, but teachest with truth the way of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But perceiving their deceit he said to them, Why do ye tempt me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shew me a denarius. Whose image and superscription has it? And answering they said, Caesar's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, Pay therefore what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were not able to take hold of him in [his] expressions before the people, and, wondering at his answer, they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, coming up [to him],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>demanded of him saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one's brother, who has a wife, die, and he die childless, his brother shall take the wife and raise up seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There were then seven brethren: and the first, having taken a wife, died childless;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the second [took the woman, and *he* died childless];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the third took her: and in like manner also the seven left no children and died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and last of all the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the resurrection therefore of which of them does she become wife, for the seven had her as wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but they who are counted worthy to have part in that world, and the resurrection from among [the] dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for neither can they die any more, for they are equal to angels, and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But that the dead rise, even Moses shewed in [the section of] the bush, when he called [the] Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but he is not God of [the] dead but of [the] living; for all live for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For they did not dare any more to ask him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he said to them, How do they say that the Christ is David's son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And, as all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and who love salutations in the market-places, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at suppers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour the houses of widows, and as a pretext make long prayers. These shall receive a severer judgment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
