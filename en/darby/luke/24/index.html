And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazaraean, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to [the] judgment of death and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But *we* had hoped that *he* was [the one] who is about to redeem Israel. But then, besides all these things, it is now, to-day, the third day since these things took place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And withal, certain women from amongst us astonished us, having been very early at the sepulchre,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and, not having found his body, came, saying that they also had seen a vision of angels, who say that he is living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some of those with us went to the sepulchre, and found it so, as the women also had said, but him they saw not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And *he* said to them, O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they drew near to the village where they were going, and *he* made as though he would go farther.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is declining. And he entered in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass as he was at table with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken it, gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And he disappeared from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning in us as he spoke to us on the way, [and] as he opened the scriptures to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, The Lord is indeed risen and has appeared to Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they related what [had happened] on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they were saying these things, he himself stood in their midst, and says to them, Peace [be] unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why are thoughts rising in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>behold my hands and my feet, that it is *I* myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as ye see me having.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But while they yet did not believe for joy, and were wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he took it and ate before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved the Christ to suffer, and to rise from among the dead the third day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations beginning at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And *ye* are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but do ye remain in the city till ye be clothed with power from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he led them out as far as Bethany, and having lifted up his hands, he blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass as he was blessing them, he was separated from them and was carried up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And *they*, having done him homage, returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and were continually in the temple praising and blessing God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
