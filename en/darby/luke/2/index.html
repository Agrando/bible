and this man was just and pious, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and [the] Holy Spirit was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it was divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death before he should see [the] Lord's Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and as the parents brought in the child Jesus that they might do for him according to the custom of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>*he* received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lord, now thou lettest thy bondman go, according to thy word, in peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a light for revelation of [the] Gentiles and [the] glory of thy people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his father and mother wondered at the things which were said concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Lo, this [child] is set for the fall and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>(and even a sword shall go through thine own soul;) so that [the] thoughts may be revealed from many hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was a prophetess, Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of [the] tribe of Asher, who was far advanced in years, having lived with [her] husband seven years from her virginity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and herself a widow up to eighty-four years; who did not depart from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and she coming up the same hour gave praise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they had completed all things according to the law of [the] Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the child grew and waxed strong [in spirit], filled with wisdom, and God's grace was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And his parents went yearly to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when he was twelve years old, and they went up [to Jerusalem] according to the custom of the feast</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and had completed the days, as they returned, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and his parents knew not [of it];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but, supposing him to be in the company that journeyed together, they went a day's journey, and sought him among their relations and acquaintances:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and not having found him they returned to Jerusalem seeking him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers and hearing them and asking them questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when they saw him they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Child, why hast thou dealt thus with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he said to them, Why [is it] that ye have sought me? did ye not know that I ought to be [occupied] in my Father's business?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they understood not the thing that he said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and he was in subjection to them. And his mother kept all these things in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
