[Is] not he that is at table? But *I* am in the midst of you as the one that serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But *ye* are they who have persevered with me in my temptations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And *I* appoint unto you, as my Father has appointed unto me, a kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you, to sift [you] as wheat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but *I* have besought for thee that thy faith fail not; and *thou*, when once thou hast been restored, confirm thy brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said to him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I tell thee, Peter, [the] cock shall not crow to-day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, When I sent you without purse and scrip and sandals, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said therefore to them, But now he that has a purse let him take [it], in like manner also a scrip, and he that has none let him sell his garment and buy a sword;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned with [the] lawless: for also the things concerning me have an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and having knelt down he prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, Father, if thou wilt remove this cup from me: but then, not my will, but thine be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in conflict he prayed more intently. And his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And rising up from his prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them, Why sleep ye? rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>As he was yet speaking, behold, a crowd, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went on before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they who were around him, seeing what was going to follow, said [to him], Lord, shall we smite with [the] sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the high priest and took off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answering said, Suffer thus far; and having touched his ear, he healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders, who were come against him, Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was day by day with you in the temple ye did not stretch out your hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And having laid hold on him, they led him [away], and they led [him] into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And they having lit a fire in the midst of the court and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a certain maid, having seen him sitting by the light, and having fixed her eyes upon him, said, And this [man] was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied [him], saying, Woman, I do not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a short time another seeing him said, And *thou* art of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And after the lapse of about one hour another stoutly maintained it, saying, In truth this [man] also was with him, for also he is a Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, [the] cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord, turning round, looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Peter, going forth without, wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men who held him mocked him, beating [him];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and covering him up, asked him saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And they said many other injurious things to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And when it was day, the elderhood of the people, both [the] chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and led him into their council, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>If *thou* art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not at all believe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if I should ask [you], ye would not answer me at all, nor let me go;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>but henceforth shall the Son of man be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And they all said, *Thou* then art the Son of God? And he said to them, *Ye* say that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, What need have we any more of witness, for we have heard ourselves out of his mouth?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
