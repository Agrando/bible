because thou hast been faithful in that which is least, be thou in authority over ten cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the second came, saying, [My] Lord, thy mina has made five minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said also to this one, And *thou*, be over five cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another came, saying, [My] Lord, lo, [there is] thy mina, which I have kept laid up in a towel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I feared thee because thou art a harsh man: thou takest up what thou hast not laid down, and thou reapest what thou hast not sowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He says to him, Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked bondman: thou knewest that *I* am a harsh man, taking up what I have not laid down and reaping what I have not sowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And why didst thou not give my money to [the] bank; and *I* should have received it, at my coming, with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to those that stood by, Take from him the mina and give [it] to him who has the ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For I say unto you, that to every one that has shall be given; but from him that has not, that even which he has shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Moreover those mine enemies, who would not [have] me to reign over them, bring them here and slay [them] before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And having said these things, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mountain called [the mount] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, Go into the village over against [you], in which ye will find, on entering it, a colt tied up, on which no [child] of man ever sat at any time: loose it and lead it [here].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose [it]? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord has need of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they that were sent, having gone their way, found as he had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were loosing the colt, its masters said to them, Why loose ye the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, Because the Lord has need of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they led it to Jesus; and having cast their own garments on the colt, they put Jesus on [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he went, they strewed their clothes in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as he drew near, already at the descent of the mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began, rejoicing, to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying, Blessed the King that comes in the name of [the] Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he answering said to them, I say unto you, If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And as he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, even at least in this thy day, the things that are for thy peace: but now they are hid from thine eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall make a palisaded mound about thee, and shall close thee around, and keep thee in on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children in thee; and shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou knewest not the season of thy visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those that sold and bought in it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but *ye* have made it a den of robbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he was teaching day by day in the temple: and the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and did not find what they could do, for all the people hung on him to hear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
