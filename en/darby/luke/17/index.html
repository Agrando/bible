I judge not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus *ye* also, when ye shall have done all things that have been ordered you, say, We are unprofitable bondmen; we have done what it was our duty to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass as he was going up to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he entered into a certain village ten leprous men met him, who stood afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they lifted up [their] voice saying, Jesus, Master, have compassion on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And seeing [them] he said to them, Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass as they were going they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, seeing that he was cured, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and fell on [his] face at his feet giving him thanks: and *he* was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but the nine, where [are they]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There have not been found to return and give glory to God save this stranger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Rise up and go thy way: thy faith has made thee well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having been asked by the Pharisees, When is the kingdom of God coming? he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor shall they say, Lo here, or, Lo there; for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to the disciples, Days are coming, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say to you, Lo here, or Lo there; go not, nor follow [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightning shines which lightens from [one end] under heaven to [the other end] under heaven, thus shall the Son of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it took place in the days of Noe, thus also shall it be in the days of the Son of man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>they ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all [of them];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and in like manner as took place in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all [of them]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>after this [manner] shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he who shall be on the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not go down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember the wife of Lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I say to you, In that night there shall be two [men] upon one bed; one shall be seized and the other shall be let go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two [women] shall be grinding together; the one shall be seized and the other shall be let go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be seized and the other let go.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And answering they say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body [is], there the eagles will be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
