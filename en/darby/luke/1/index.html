And he was making signs to them, and continued dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when the days of his service were completed, he departed to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now after these days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus has [the] Lord done to me in [these] days in which he looked upon [me] to take away my reproach among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent of God to a city of Galilee, of which [the] name [was] Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name [was] Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name [was] Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, [thou] favoured one! the Lord [is] with thee: [blessed art *thou* amongst women].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But she, [seeing] [the angel], was troubled at his word, and reasoned in her mind what this salutation might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>*He* shall be great, and shall be called Son of [the] Highest; and [the] Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the ages, and of his kingdom there shall not be an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answering said to her, [The] Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of [the] Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And behold, Elizabeth, thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her that was called barren:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>for nothing shall be impossible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Mary said, Behold the bondmaid of [the] Lord; be it to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Mary, rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with [the] Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed [art] *thou* amongst women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For behold, as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped with joy in my womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed [is] she that has believed, for there shall be a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For he has looked upon the low estate of his bondmaid; for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For the Mighty One has done to me great things, and holy [is] his name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and his mercy [is] to generations and generations to them that fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He has wrought strength with his arm; he has scattered haughty [ones] in the thought of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He has put down rulers from thrones, and exalted the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He has filled the hungry with good things, and sent away the rich empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He has helped Israel his servant, in order to remember mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>(as he spoke to our fathers,) to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth that she should bring forth, and she gave birth to a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that [the] Lord had magnified his mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it came to pass on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called it after the name of his father, Zacharias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother answering said, No; but he shall be called John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said to her, There is no one among thy kinsfolk who is called by this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And having asked for a writing-table, he wrote saying, John is his name. And they all wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake, blessing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came upon all who dwelt round about them; and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these things were the subject of conversation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? And [the] Lord's hand was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Zacharias his father was filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed be [the] Lord the God of Israel, because he has visited and wrought redemption for his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and raised up a horn of deliverance for us in the house of David his servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>as he spoke by [the] mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>deliverance from our enemies and out of the hand of all who hate us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>to fulfil mercy with our fathers and remember his holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>[the] oath which he swore to Abraham our father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>to give us, that, saved out of the hand of our enemies, we should serve him without fear</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>in piety and righteousness before him all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And *thou*, child, shalt be called [the] prophet of [the] Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of [the] Lord to make ready his ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>to give knowledge of deliverance to his people by [the] remission of their sins</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>on account of [the] bowels of mercy of our God; wherein [the] dayspring from on high has visited us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>to shine upon them who were sitting in darkness and in [the] shadow of death, to guide our feet into [the] way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit; and he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
