And he answering him said, Thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find no guilt in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee even on to here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Pilate, having heard Galilee [named], demanded if the man were a Galilaean;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and having learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, remitted him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when Herod saw Jesus he greatly rejoiced, for he had been a long while desirous of seeing him, because of hearing many things concerning him, and he hoped to see some sign done by him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he questioned him in many words, but *he* answered him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the chief priests and the scribes stood and accused him violently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Herod with his troops having set him at nought and mocked him, having put a splendid robe upon him, sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Pilate and Herod became friends with one another the same day, for they had been at enmity before between themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Pilate, having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>said to them, Ye have brought to me this man as turning away the people [to rebellion], and behold, I, having examined him before you, have found nothing criminal in this man as to the things of which ye accuse him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>nor Herod either, for I remitted you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Having chastised him therefore, I will release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>( Now he was obliged to release one for them at the feast.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they cried out in a mass saying, Away with this [man] and release Barabbas to us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who was one who, for a certain tumult which had taken place in the city, and [for] murder, had been cast into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pilate therefore, desirous to release Jesus, again addressed [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they cried out in reply saying, Crucify, crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said the third time to them, What evil then has this [man] done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will chastise him therefore and release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they were urgent with loud voices, begging that he might be crucified. And their voices [and those of the chief priests] prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released him who, for tumult and murder, had been cast into prison, whom they begged for, and Jesus he delivered up to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they led him away, they laid hold on a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, and put the cross upon him to bear it behind Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a great multitude of the people, and of women who wailed and lamented him, followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus turning round to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over me, but weep over yourselves and over your children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for behold, days are coming in which they will say, Blessed [are] the barren, and wombs that have not borne, and breasts that have not given suck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for if these things are done in the green tree, what shall take place in the dry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now two others also, malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they came to the place which is called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And, parting out his garments, they cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people stood beholding, and the rulers also [with them] sneered, saying, He has saved others; let him save himself if this is the Christ, the chosen one of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the soldiers also made game of him, coming up offering him vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, If *thou* be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And there was also an inscription [written] over him in Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew letters: This is the King of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke insultingly to him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost *thou* too not fear God, thou that art under the same judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and *we* indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this [man] has done nothing amiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said to Jesus, Remember me, [Lord,] when thou comest in thy kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And it was about [the] sixth hour, and there came darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple rent in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus, having cried with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, he expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now the centurion, seeing what took place, glorified God, saying, In very deed this man was just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all the crowds who had come together to that sight, having seen the things that took place, returned, beating [their] breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all those who knew him stood afar off, the women also who had followed him from Galilee, beholding these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good man and a just</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(this [man] had not assented to their counsel and deed), of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also waited, [himself also,] for the kingdom of God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>he having gone to Pilate begged the body of Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and having taken it down, wrapped it in fine linen and placed him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had ever been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And it was preparation day, and [the] sabbath twilight was coming on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed, saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath, according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
