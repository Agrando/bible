Thus there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who shall be able to decide between his brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But brother prosecutes his suit with brother, and that before unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Already indeed then it is altogether a fault in you that ye have suits between yourselves. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong? why are ye not rather defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But *ye* do wrong, and defraud, and this [your] brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do ye not know that unrighteous [persons] shall not inherit [the] kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who make women of themselves, nor who abuse themselves with men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor abusive persons, nor [the] rapacious, shall inherit [the] kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful to me, but all things do not profit; all things are lawful to me, but *I* will not be brought under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will bring to nothing both it and them: but the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And God has both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up from among [the dead] by his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then, taking the members of the Christ, make [them] members of a harlot? Far be the thought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do ye not know that he [that is] joined to the harlot is one body? for the two, he says, shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he that [is] joined to the Lord is one Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication.
