Is God occupied about the oxen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>or does he say [it] altogether for our sakes? For for our sakes it has been written, that the plougher should plough in hope, and he that treads out corn, in hope of partaking of [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we have sown to you spiritual things, [is it a] great [thing] if *we* shall reap your carnal things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others partake of this right over you, should not rather *we*? But we have not used this right, but we bear all things, that we may put no hindrance in the way of the glad tidings of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do ye not know that they who labour [at] sacred things eat of the [offerings offered in the] temple; they that attend at the altar partake with the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So also the Lord has ordained to those that announce the glad tidings to live of the glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But *I* have used none of these things. Now I have not written these things that it should be thus in my case; for [it were] good for me rather to die than that any one should make vain my boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if I announce the glad tidings, I have nothing to boast of; for a necessity is laid upon me; for it is woe to me if I should not announce the glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if not of my own will, I am entrusted with an administration.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What is the reward then that I have? That in announcing the glad tidings I make the glad tidings costless [to others], so as not to have made use, as belonging to me, of my right in [announcing] the glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For being free from all, I have made myself bondman to all, that I might gain the most [possible].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I became to the Jews as a Jew, in order that I might gain the Jews: to those under law, as under law, not being myself under law, in order that I might gain those under law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to those without law, as without law, (not as without law to God, but as legitimately subject to Christ,) in order that I might gain [those] without law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I became to the weak, [as] weak, in order that I might gain the weak. To all I have become all things, in order that at all events I might save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I do all things for the sake of the glad tidings, that I may be fellow-partaker with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Know ye not that they who run in [the] race-course run all, but one receives the prize? Thus run in order that ye may obtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But every one that contends [for a prize] is temperate in all things: *they* then indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown, but *we* an incorruptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>*I* therefore thus run, as not uncertainly; so I combat, as not beating the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I buffet my body, and lead it captive, lest [after] having preached to others I should be myself rejected.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
