But when he says that all things are put in subjection, [it is] evident that [it is] except him who put all things in subjection to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when all things shall have been brought into subjection to him, then the Son also himself shall be placed in subjection to him who put all things in subjection to him, that God may be all in all.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Since what shall the baptised for the dead do if [those that are] dead rise not at all? why also are they baptised for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Why do *we* also endanger ourselves every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Daily I die, by your boasting which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If, [to speak] after the manner of man, I have fought with beasts in Ephesus, what is the profit to me if [those that are] dead do not rise? let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Awake up righteously, and sin not; for some are ignorant of God: I speak to you as a matter of shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Fool; what *thou* sowest is not quickened unless it die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain: it may be of wheat, or some one of the rest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and God gives to it a body as he has pleased, and to each of the seeds its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Every flesh [is] not the same flesh, but one [is] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another [flesh] of birds, and another of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And [there are] heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies: but different is the glory of the heavenly, different that of the earthly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>one [the] sun's glory, and another [the] moon's glory, and another [the] stars' glory; for star differs from star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Thus also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body: if there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [one].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thus also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But that which is spiritual [was] not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>the first man out of [the] earth, made of dust; the second man, out of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Such as he made of dust, such also those made of dust; and such as the heavenly [one], such also the heavenly [ones].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have borne the image of the [one] made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly [one].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom, nor does corruption inherit incorruptibility.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all fall asleep, but we shall all be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in an instant, in [the] twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and *we* shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility, and this mortal put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word written: Death has been swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Where, O death, [is] thy sting? where, O death, thy victory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Now the sting of death [is] sin, and the power of sin the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>but thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in [the] Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
