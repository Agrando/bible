Nor do I even examine myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So that do not judge anything before [the] time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have [his] praise from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their application, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us the [lesson of] not [letting your thoughts go] above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for [such a] one against another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why boastest thou as not receiving?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that *we* also might reign with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death. For we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>*We* [are] fools for Christ's sake, but *ye* prudent in Christ: *we* weak, but *ye* strong: *ye* glorious, but *we* in dishonour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are in nakedness, and buffeted, and wander without a home,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and labour, working with our own hands. Railed at, we bless; persecuted, we suffer [it];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>insulted, we entreat: we are become as [the] offscouring of the world, [the] refuse of all, until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Not [as] chiding do I write these things to you, but as my beloved children I admonish [you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if ye should have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus *I* have begotten you through the glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I entreat you therefore, be my imitators.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this reason I have sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved and faithful child in [the] Lord, who shall put you in mind of my ways [as] they [are] in Christ, according as I teach everywhere in every assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But some have been puffed up, as if I were not coming to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but I will come quickly to you, if the Lord will; and I will know, not the word of those that are puffed up, but the power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God [is] not in word, but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What will ye? that I come to you with a rod; or in love, and [in] a spirit of meekness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
