But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to [the part] that lacked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there might be no division in the body, but that the members might have the same concern one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with [it]; and if one member be glorified, all the members rejoice with [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now *ye* are Christ's body, and members in particular.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>[Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all [in possession of] miraculous powers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
