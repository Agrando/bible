But greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he interpret, that the assembly may receive edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I shall speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in teaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Even lifeless things giving a sound, whether pipe or harp, if they give not distinction to the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For also, if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for war?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus also *ye* with the tongue, unless ye give a distinct speech, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking to the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of undistinguishable sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore I do not know the power of the sound, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks a barbarian for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus *ye* also, since ye are desirous of spirits, seek that ye may abound for the edification of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Wherefore let him that speaks with a tongue pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray with a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Since otherwise, if thou blessest with [the] spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the simple [Christian] say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, since he does not know what thou sayest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For *thou* indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank God I speak in a tongue more than all of you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but in [the] assembly I desire to speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also, [rather] than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren, be not children in [your] minds, but in malice be babes; but in [your] minds be grown [men].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is written in the law, By people of other tongues, and by strange lips, will I speak to this people; and neither thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So that tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to unbelievers; but prophecy, not to unbelievers, but to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and simple [persons] enter in, or unbelievers, will not they say ye are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or simple [person] come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling upon [his] face, he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each [of you] has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any one speak with a tongue, [let it be] two, or at the most three, and separately, and let one interpret;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but if there be no interpreter, let him be silent in [the] assembly, and let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And let two or three prophets speak, and let the others judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if there be a revelation to another sitting [there], let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not [a God] of disorder but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let [your] women be silent in the assemblies, for it is not permitted to them to speak; but to be in subjection, as the law also says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Did the word of God go out from you, or did it come to you only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is [the] Lord's commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So that, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid the speaking with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But let all things be done comelily and with order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
