or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save thy wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>However, as the Lord has divided to each, as God has called each, so let him walk; and thus I ordain in all the assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Has any one been called circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: has any one been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but keeping God's commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let each abide in that calling in which he has been called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hast thou been called [being] a bondman, let it not concern thee; but and if thou canst become free, use [it] rather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the bondman that is called in [the] Lord is the Lord's freedman; in like manner [also] the freeman being called is Christ's bondman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ye have been bought with a price; do not be the bondmen of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let each, wherein he is called, brethren, therein abide with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But concerning virgins, I have no commandment of [the] Lord; but I give my opinion, as having received mercy of [the] Lord to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I think then that this is good, on account of the present necessity, that [it is] good for a man to remain so as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; art thou free from a wife? do not seek a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if thou shouldest also marry, thou hast not sinned; and if the virgin marry, they have not sinned: but such shall have tribulation in the flesh; but I spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brethren, the time is straitened. For the rest, that they who have wives, be as not having [any]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and they that weep, as not weeping; and they that rejoice, as not rejoicing; and they that buy, as not possessing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and they that use the world, as not disposing of it as their own; for the fashion of this world passes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I wish you to be without care. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but he that has married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>There is a difference between the wife and the virgin. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she that has married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But I say this for your own profit; not that I may set a snare before you, but for what [is] seemly, and waiting on the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if any one think that he behaves unseemly to his virginity, if he be beyond the flower of his age, and so it must be, let him do what he will, he does not sin: let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he who stands firm in his heart, having no need, but has authority over his own will, and has judged this in his heart to keep his own virginity, he does well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So that he that marries himself does well; and he that does not marry does better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A wife is bound for whatever time her husband lives; but if the husband be fallen asleep, she is free to be married to whom she will, only in [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier if she so remain, according to my judgment; but I think that *I* also have God's Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
