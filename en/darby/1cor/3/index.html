For whereas [there are] among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For when one says, *I* am of Paul, and another, *I* of Apollos, are ye not men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>*I* have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are God's fellow-workmen; ye are God's husbandry, God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is] laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if any one build upon [this] foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare [it], because it is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If the work of any one which he has built upon [the foundation] shall abide, he shall receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but *he* shall be saved, but so as through [the] fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are *ye*.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again, [The] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and *ye* [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
