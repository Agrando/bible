But if [it be] shameful to a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God's image and glory; but woman is man's glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For man is not of woman, but woman of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head, on account of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>However, neither [is] woman without man, nor man without woman, in [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as the woman [is] of the man, so also [is] the man by the woman, but all things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman should pray to God uncovered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does not even nature itself teach you, that man, if he have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But woman, if she have long hair, [it is] glory to her; for the long hair is given [to her] in lieu of a veil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if any one think to be contentious, *we* have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But [in] prescribing [to you on] this [which I now enter on], I do not praise, [namely,] that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For first, when ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you, and I partly give credit [to it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must also be sects among you, that the approved may become manifest among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat [the] Lord's supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For each one in eating takes his *own* supper before [others], and one is hungry and another drinks to excess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this [point] I do not praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and having given thanks broke [it], and said, This is my body, which [is] for you: this do in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink [it], in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For [the] eater and drinker eats and drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>On this account many among you [are] weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But being judged, we are disciplined of [the] Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So that, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together for judgment. But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
