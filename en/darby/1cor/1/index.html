has Paul been crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God's power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where [is the] wise? where scribe? where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but *we* preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those that [are] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God's power and God's wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For consider your calling, brethren, that [there are] not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has God chosen, [and] things that are not, that he may annul the things that are;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so that no flesh should boast before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But of him are *ye* in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in [the] Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
