For he that doubts is like a wave of the sea driven by the wind and tossed about;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for let not that man think that he shall receive anything from the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>[he is] a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But let the brother of low degree glory in his elevation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the rich in his humiliation, because as [the] grass's flower he will pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the sun has risen with its burning heat, and has withered the grass, and its flower has fallen, and the comeliness of its look has perished: thus the rich also shall wither in his goings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed [is the] man who endures temptation; for, having been proved, he shall receive the crown of life, which He has promised to them that love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no man, being tempted, say, I am tempted of God. For God cannot be tempted by evil things, and himself tempts no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But every one is tempted, drawn away, and enticed by his own lust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>then lust, having conceived, gives birth to sin; but sin fully completed brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not err, my beloved brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift comes down from above, from the Father of lights, with whom is no variation nor shadow of turning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>According to his own will begat he us by the word of truth, that we should be a certain first-fruits of *his* creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So that, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for man's wrath does not work God's righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wherefore, laying aside all filthiness and abounding of wickedness, accept with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But be ye doers of [the] word and not hearers only, beguiling yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if any man be a hearer of [the] word and not a doer, *he* is like to a man considering his natural face in a mirror:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he has considered himself and is gone away, and straightway he has forgotten what he was like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But *he* that fixes his view on [the] perfect law, that of liberty, and abides in [it], being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of [the] work, *he* shall be blessed in his doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any one think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his heart, this man's religion is vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
