[Is it] not thence, from your pleasures, which war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ye lust and have not: ye kill and are full of envy, and cannot obtain; ye fight and war; ye have not because ye ask not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask evilly, that ye may consume [it] in your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Adulteresses, know ye not that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore is minded to be [the] friend of the world is constituted enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Think ye that the scripture speaks in vain? Does the Spirit which has taken his abode in us desire enviously?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives more grace. Wherefore he says, God sets himself against [the] proud, but gives grace to [the] lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Subject yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse [your] hands, sinners, and purify [your] hearts, ye double-minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be wretched, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and [your] joy to heaviness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves before [the] Lord, and he shall exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Speak not against one another, brethren. He that speaks against [his] brother, or judges his brother, speaks against [the] law and judges [the] law. But if thou judgest [the] law, thou art not doer of [the] law, but judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One is the lawgiver and judge, who is able to save and to destroy: but who art *thou* who judgest thy neighbour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go to now, ye who say, To-day or to-morrow will we go into such a city and spend a year there, and traffic and make gain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>ye who do not know what will be on the morrow, ([for] what [is] your life? It is even a vapour, appearing for a little while, and then disappearing,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>instead of your saying, If the Lord should [so] will and we should live, we will also do this or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To him therefore who knows how to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
