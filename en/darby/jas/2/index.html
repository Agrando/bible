Do not the rich oppress you, and [do not] *they* drag you before [the] tribunals?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And [do not] *they* blaspheme the excellent name which has been called upon you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If indeed ye keep [the] royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever shall keep the whole law and shall offend in one [point], he has come under the guilt of [breaking] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become transgressor of [the] law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak ye, and so act, as those that are to be judged by [the] law of liberty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for judgment [will be] without mercy to him that has shewn no mercy. Mercy glories over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What [is] the profit, my brethren, if any one say he have faith, but have not works? can faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if a brother or a sister is naked and destitute of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one from amongst you say to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled; but give not to them the needful things for the body, what [is] the profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So also faith, if it have not works, is dead by itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But some one will say, *Thou* hast faith and *I* have works. Shew me thy faith without works, and *I* from my works will shew thee my faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>*Thou* believest that God is one. Thou doest well. The demons even believe, and tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and that by works faith was perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness, and he was called Friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ye see that a man is justified on the principle of works, and not on the principle of faith only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But was not in like manner also Rahab the harlot justified on the principle of works, when she had received the messengers and put [them] forth by another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without a spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
