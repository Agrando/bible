Ye have heaped up treasure in [the] last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the wages of your labourers, who have harvested your fields, wrongfully kept back by you, cry, and the cries of those that have reaped are entered into the ears of [the] Lord of sabaoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ye have lived luxuriously on the earth and indulged yourselves; ye have nourished your hearts [as] in a day of slaughter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>ye have condemned, ye have killed the just; he does not resist you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Have patience, therefore, brethren, till the coming of the Lord. Behold, the labourer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, having patience for it until it receive [the] early and [the] latter rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>*Ye* also have patience: stablish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is drawn nigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Complain not one against another, brethren, that ye be not judged. Behold, the judge stands before the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take [as] an example, brethren, of suffering and having patience, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of [the] Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, we call them blessed who have endured. Ye have heard of the endurance of Job, and seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is full of tender compassion and pitiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, that ye do not fall under judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Does any one among you suffer evil? let him pray. Is any happy? let him sing psalms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any sick among you? let him call to [him] the elders of the assembly, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of [the] Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the prayer of faith shall heal the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he be one who has committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess therefore your offences to one another, and pray for one another, that ye may be healed. [The] fervent supplication of the righteous [man] has much power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Elias was a man of like passions to us, and he prayed with prayer that it should not rain; and it did not rain upon the earth three years and six months;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth caused its fruit to spring forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My brethren, if any one among you err from the truth, and one bring him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>let him know that he that brings back a sinner from [the] error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
