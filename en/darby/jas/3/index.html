If any one offend not in word, *he* [is] a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, we put the bits in the mouths of the horses, that they may obey us, and we turn round their whole bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also the ships, which are so great, and driven by violent winds, are turned about by a very small rudder, wherever the pleasure of the helmsman will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. See how little a fire, how large a wood it kindles!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the tongue [is] fire, the world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set in our members, the defiler of the whole body, and which sets fire to the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every species both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and of sea animals, is tamed and has been tamed by the human species;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but the tongue can no one among men tame; [it is] an unsettled evil, full of death-bringing poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse we men made after [the] likeness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Out of the same mouth goes forth blessing and cursing. It is not right, my brethren, that these things should be thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does the fountain, out of the same opening, pour forth sweet and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can, my brethren, a fig produce olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt [water] make sweet water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who [is] wise and understanding among you; let him shew out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This is not the wisdom which comes down from above, but earthly, natural, devilish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where emulation and strife [are], there [is] disorder and every evil thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful, gentle, yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, unquestioning, unfeigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But [the] fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them that make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
