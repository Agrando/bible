His fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jehovah is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that trust in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But with an overrunning flood he will make a full end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What do ye imagine against Jehovah? He will make a full end: trouble shall not rise up the second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Though they be tangled together [as] thorns, and be as drenched from their drink, they shall be devoured as dry stubble, completely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Out of thee is gone forth one that imagineth evil against Jehovah, a wicked counsellor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus saith Jehovah: Though they be complete in number, and many as they be, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away; and though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds asunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jehovah hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy god will I cut off the graven image, and the molten image: I will prepare thy grave; for thou art vile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth glad tidings, that publisheth peace! Celebrate thy feasts, Judah, perform thy vows: for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
