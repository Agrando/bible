but a grievous word stirreth up anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright; but the mouth of the foolish poureth out folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The eyes of Jehovah are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Gentleness of tongue is a tree of life; but crookedness therein is a breaking of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A fool despiseth his father's instruction; but he that regardeth reproof becometh prudent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the house of a righteous [man] is much treasure; but in the revenue of a wicked [man] is disturbance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The lips of the wise disperse knowledge, but not so the heart of the foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to Jehovah; but the prayer of the upright is his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The way of a wicked [man] is an abomination to Jehovah; but him that pursueth righteousness he loveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Grievous correction is for him that forsaketh the path; he that hateth reproof shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Sheol and destruction are before Jehovah; how much more then the hearts of the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him; he will not go unto the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A joyful heart maketh a cheerful countenance; but by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The heart of an intelligent [man] seeketh knowledge; but the mouth of the foolish feedeth on folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All the days of the afflicted are evil; but a cheerful heart is a continual feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is little with the fear of Jehovah than great store and disquietude therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Better is a meal of herbs where love is, than a fatted ox and hatred therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A furious man stirreth up contention; but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns; but the path of the upright is made plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A wise son maketh a glad father; but a foolish man despiseth his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Folly is joy to him that is void of sense; but a man of understanding regulateth his walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Without counsel purposes are disappointed; but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth; and a word in its season, how good is it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The path of life is upwards for the wise, that he may depart from Sheol beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jehovah plucketh up the house of the proud; but he establisheth the boundary of the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The thoughts of the evil [man] are an abomination to Jehovah; but pure words are pleasant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The heart of a righteous [man] studieth to answer; but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jehovah is far from the wicked; but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That which enlighteneth the eyes rejoiceth the heart; good tidings make the bones fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The ear that heareth the reproof of life shall abide among the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul; but he that heareth reproof getteth sense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The fear of Jehovah is the discipline of wisdom, and before honour [goeth] humility.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
