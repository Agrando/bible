to discern the words of understanding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and judgment, and equity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the wise and their enigmas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools despise wisdom and instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy foot from their path;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it taketh away the life of its possessors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate knowledge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, and shall not find me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>they would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be filled with their own devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from fear of evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
