but Jehovah weigheth the spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Commit thy works unto Jehovah, and thy thoughts shall be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jehovah hath wrought everything on his own account, yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Every proud heart is an abomination to Jehovah: hand for hand, he shall not be held innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>By loving-kindness and truth iniquity is atoned for; and by the fear of Jehovah [men] depart from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When a man's ways please Jehovah, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Better is a little with righteousness, than great revenues without right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The heart of man deviseth his way, but Jehovah directeth his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>An oracle is on the lips of the king: his mouth will not err in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The just balance and scales are Jehovah's; all the weights of the bag are his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; for the throne is established by righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Righteous lips are the delight of kings, and they love him that speaketh aright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The fury of a king is [as] messengers of death; but a wise man will pacify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the light of the king's countenance is life, and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>How much better is it to get wisdom than fine gold, and the getting of intelligence to be preferred to silver!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that taketh heed to his way keepeth his soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pride [goeth] before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Better is it to be of a humble spirit with the meek, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that giveth heed to the word shall find good; and whoso confideth in Jehovah, happy is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wise in heart is called intelligent, and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wisdom is a fountain of life for him that hath it; but the instruction of fools is folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The heart of the wise maketh his mouth intelligent, and upon his lips increaseth learning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pleasant words are [as] a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health for the bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is the ways of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The appetite of the labourer laboureth for him, for his mouth urgeth him on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A man of Belial diggeth up evil, and on his lips there is as a scorching fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A false man soweth contention; and a talebearer separateth very friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into a way that is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He that shutteth his eyes, [it is] to devise froward things; biting his lips, he bringeth evil to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The hoary head is a crown of glory, [if] it is found in the way of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole decision is of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
