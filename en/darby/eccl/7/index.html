This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad, and a gift destroyeth the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Better is the end of a thing than its beginning; better is a patient spirit than a proud spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be not hasty in thy spirit to be vexed; for vexation resteth in the bosom of fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Say not, How is it that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, and profitable to them that see the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For wisdom is a defence [as] money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, [that] wisdom maketh them that possess it to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Consider the work of God; for who can make straight what he hath made crooked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the day of prosperity enjoy good, and in the day of adversity consider: God hath also set the one beside the other, to the end that man should find out nothing [of what shall be] after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All [this] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a righteous [man] that perisheth by his righteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongeth [his days] by his wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God cometh forth from them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty [men] that are in a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also give not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For also thine own heart knoweth that oftentimes thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All this have I tried by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whatever hath been, is far off, and exceeding deep: who will find it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I turned, I and my heart, to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom and reason, and to know wickedness to be folly, and foolishness to be madness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is nets and snares, [and] whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be caught by her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>See this which I have found, saith the Preacher, [searching] one by one to find out the reason;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>which my soul yet seeketh, and I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all those have I not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Only see this which I have found: that God made man upright, but they have sought out many devices.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
