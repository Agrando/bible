Wherefore should God be wroth at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For in the multitude of dreams are vanities; so with many words: but fear God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter; for a higher than the high is watching, and there are higher than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moreover the earth is every way profitable: the king [himself] is dependent upon the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what profit is there to the owner thereof, except the beholding [of them] with his eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sleep of the labourer is sweet, whether he have eaten little or much; but the fulness of the rich doth not suffer him to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or those riches perish by some evil circumstance, and if he have begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked shall he go away again as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came so doth he go away, and what profit hath he, in having laboured for the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All his days also he eateth in darkness, and hath much vexation, and sickness, and irritation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold what I have seen good and comely: [it is] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labour wherewith [man] laboureth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for that is his portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and power to eat thereof, and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour: that is a gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For he will not much remember the days of his life, because God answereth [him] with the joy of his heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
