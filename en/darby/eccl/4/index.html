This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Better is a handful with quietness, than both hands full with labour and pursuit of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There is one [alone] and without a second; also he hath neither son nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, and [he saith not], For whom then am I labouring, and depriving my soul of good? This also is vanity and a grievous occupation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and who hath not another to lift him up!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one alone be warm?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a [man] overpower the one, the two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth no more how to be admonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For out of the prison-house he came forth to reign, although he was born poor in his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I saw all the living that walk under the sun, with the child, the second, that should stand up in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[There is] no end of all the people, of all that stood before them; those however that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after the wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
