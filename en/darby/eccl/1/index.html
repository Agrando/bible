The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which will be done: and there is nothing new under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already in the ages which were before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be remembrance of things that are to come with those who shall live afterwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I applied my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens: this grievous occupation hath God given to the children of men to weary themselves therewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and pursuit of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have acquired wisdom more than all they that have been before me over Jerusalem; and my heart hath seen much of wisdom and knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I applied my heart to the knowledge of wisdom, and to the knowledge of madness and folly: I perceived that this also is a striving after the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
