A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face is changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I [say], Keep the king's commandment, and [that] on account of the oath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Be not hasty to go out of his sight; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatever pleaseth him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because the word of a king is power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man's heart knoweth time and manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For to every purpose there is time and manner. For the misery of man is great upon him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There is no man who hath control over the spirit to retain the spirit; and no one hath control over the day of death; and there is no discharge in that war, neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time when man ruleth man to his hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I have also seen the wicked buried and going away; and such as had acted rightly went from [the] holy place, and were forgotten in the city. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set in them to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and prolong his [days], yet I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, because they fear before him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong [his] days as a shadow, because he feareth not before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are righteous [men] unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; and there are wicked [men] to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I commended mirth, because there is nothing better for man under the sun than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry; for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God hath given him under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then I saw that all [is] the work of God, [and] that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however man may labour to seek [it] out, yet doth he not find [it]; and even, if a wise [man] think to know [it], he shall not be able to find [it] out.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
