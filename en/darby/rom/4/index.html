And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but of debt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Blessed [they] whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>blessed [the] man to whom [the] Lord shall not at all reckon sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[Does] this blessedness then [rest] on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For we say that faith has been reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then has it been reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he received [the] sign of circumcision [as] seal of the righteousness of faith which [he had] being in uncircumcision, that he might be [the] father of all them that believe being in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned to them also;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and father of circumcision, not only to those who are of [the] circumcision, but to those also who walk in the steps of the faith, during uncircumcision, of our father Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For [it was] not by law that the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of [the] world, but by righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if they which [are] of law be heirs, faith is made vain, and the promise made of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For law works wrath; but where no law is neither [is there] transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore [it is] on the principle of faith, that [it might be] according to grace, in order to the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that only which [is] of the law, but to that also which [is] of Abraham's faith, who is father of us all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(according as it is written, I have made thee father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls the things which be not as being;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who against hope believed in hope to his becoming father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body already become dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadening of Sarah's womb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief; but found strength in faith, giving glory to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and being fully persuaded that what he has promised he is able also to do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>wherefore also it was reckoned to him as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it was not written on his account alone that it was reckoned to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but on ours also, to whom, believing on him who has raised from among [the] dead Jesus our Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who has been delivered for our offences and has been raised for our justification, it will be reckoned.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
