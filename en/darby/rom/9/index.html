Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not however as though the word of God had failed; for not all [are] Israel which [are] of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>nor because they are seed of Abraham [are] all children: but, In Isaac shall a seed be called to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, [they that are] the children of the flesh, these [are] not the children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned as seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this word [is] of promise, According to this time I will come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only [that], but Rebecca having conceived by one, Isaac our father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>[the children] indeed being not yet born, or having done anything good or worthless (that the purpose of God according to election might abide, not of works, but of him that calls),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>it was said to her, The greater shall serve the less:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>according as it is written, I have loved Jacob, and I have hated Esau.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we say then? [Is there] unrighteousness with God? Far be the thought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he says to Moses, I will shew mercy to whom I will shew mercy, and I will feel compassion for whom I will feel compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then [it is] not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shews mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very thing I have raised thee up from amongst [men], that I might thus shew in thee my power, and so that my name should be declared in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then, to whom he will he shews mercy, and whom he will he hardens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say to me then, Why does he yet find fault? for who resists his purpose?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Aye, but thou, O man, who art *thou* that answerest again to God? Shall the thing formed say to him that has formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make one vessel to honour, and another to dishonour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if God, minded to shew his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he had before prepared for glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>us, whom he has also called, not only from amongst [the] Jews, but also from amongst [the] nations?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As he says also in Hosea, I will call not-my-people My people; and the-not-beloved Beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, *Ye* [are] not my people, there shall they be called Sons of [the] living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Esaias cries concerning Israel, Should the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for [he] is bringing the matter to an end, and [cutting [it] short in righteousness; because] a cutting short of the matter will [the] Lord accomplish upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And according as Esaias said before, Unless [the] Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom, and made like even as Gomorrha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What then shall we say? That [they of the] nations, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained righteousness, but [the] righteousness that is on the principle of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel, pursuing after a law of righteousness, has not attained to [that] law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Wherefore? Because [it was] not on the principle of faith, but as of works. They have stumbled at the stumblingstone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>according as it is written, Behold, I place in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and he that believes on him shall not be ashamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
