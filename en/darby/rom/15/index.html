but according as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction, that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now the God of endurance and of encouragement give to you to be like-minded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore receive ye one another, according as the Christ also has received you to [the] glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I say that Jesus Christ became a minister of [the] circumcision for [the] truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and that the nations should glorify God for mercy; according as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among [the] nations, and will sing to thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And again he says, Rejoice, nations, with his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again, Praise the Lord, all [ye] nations, and let all the peoples laud him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, Esaias says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and one that arises, to rule over [the] nations: in him shall [the] nations hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye should abound in hope by [the] power of [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I am persuaded, my brethren, I myself also, concerning you, that yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have written to you the more boldly, [brethren,] in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace given to me by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for me to be minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, carrying on as a sacrificial service the [message of] glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have therefore [whereof to] boast in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me, for [the] obedience of [the] nations, by word and deed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in [the] power of signs and wonders, in [the] power of [the] Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and so aiming to announce the glad tidings, not where Christ has been named, that I might not build upon another's foundation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but according as it is written, To whom there was nothing told concerning him, they shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore also I have been often hindered from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now, having no longer place in these regions, and having great desire to come to you these many years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whenever I should go to Spain; (for I hope to see you as I go through, and by you to be set forward thither, if first I shall have been in part filled with your company;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but now I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for Macedonia and Achaia have been well pleased to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who [are] in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They have been well pleased indeed, and they are their debtors; for if the nations have participated in their spiritual things, they ought also in fleshly to minister to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Having finished this therefore, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will set off by you into Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know that, coming to you, I shall come in [the] fulness of [the] blessing of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers for me to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be saved from those that do not believe in Judaea; and that my ministry which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>in order that I may come to you in joy by God's will, and that I may be refreshed with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
