For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they who [thus] resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil [one]. Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority? practise [what is] good, and thou shalt have praise from it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for it is God's minister to thee for good. But if thou practisest evil, fear; for it bears not the sword in vain; for it is God's minister, an avenger for wrath to him that does evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For on this account ye pay tribute also; for they are God's officers, attending continually on this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render to all their dues: to whom tribute [is due], tribute; to whom custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no one anything, unless to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lust; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love works no ill to its neighbour; love therefore [is the] whole law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that *we* should be aroused out of sleep; for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far spent, and the day is near; let us cast away therefore the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and lasciviousness, not in strife and emulation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh to [fulfil its] lusts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
