For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which [is] by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And [shall] not as by one that has sinned [be] the gift? For the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the act of favour, of many offences unto justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one, much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so then as [it was] by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But law came in, in order that the offence might abound; but where sin abounded grace has overabounded,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>in order that, even as sin has reigned in [the power of] death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
