[is] the law sin? Far be the thought. But I had not known sin, unless by law: for I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not lust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, wrought in me every lust; for without law sin [was] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But *I* was alive without law once; but the commandment having come, sin revived, but *I* died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the commandment, which [was] for life, was found, [as] to me, itself [to be] unto death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for sin, getting a point of attack by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew [me].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So that the law indeed [is] holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Did then that which is good become death to me? Far be the thought. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me by that which is good; in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the law is spiritual: but *I* am fleshly, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For that which I do, I do not own: for not what I will, this I do; but what I hate, this I practise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if what I do not will, this I practise, I consent to the law that [it is] right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now then [it is] no longer *I* [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, good does not dwell: for to will is there with me, but to do right [I find] not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I do not practise the good that I will; but the evil I do not will, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if what *I* do not will, this I practise, [it is] no longer *I* [that] do it, but the sin that dwells in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find then the law upon *me* who will to practise what is right, that with *me* evil is there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I see another law in my members, warring in opposition to the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which exists in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O wretched man that I [am]! who shall deliver me out of this body of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then *I* *myself* with the mind serve God's law; but with the flesh sin's law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
