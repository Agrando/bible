and they that are according to Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the mind of the flesh [is] death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and they that are in flesh cannot please God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But *ye* are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not [the] Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [the] dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among [the] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with [him], that we may also be glorified with [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its will, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same], in hope</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only [that], but even *we* ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, [that is] the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For we have been saved in hope; but hope seen is not hope; for what any one sees, why does he also hope?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if what we see not we hope, we expect in patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he who searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But we *do* know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be [the] firstborn among many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? [It is] God who justifies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>who is he that condemns? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather has been [also] raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which [is] in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
