And he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One man esteems day more than day; another esteems every day [alike]. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He that regards the day, regards it to [the] Lord. And he that eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, [it is] to [the] Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For both if we should live, [it is] to the Lord we live; and if we should die, [it is] to the Lord we die: both if we should live then, and if we should die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this [end] Christ has died and lived [again], that he might rule over both dead and living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou make little of thy brother? for we shall all be placed before the judgment-seat of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written, *I* live, saith [the] Lord, that to me shall bow every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us no longer therefore judge one another; but judge ye this rather, not to put a stumbling-block or a fall-trap before his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except to him who reckons anything to be unclean, to that man [it is] unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if on account of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer according to love. Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ has died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not then your good be evil spoken of;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he that in this serves the Christ [is] acceptable to God and approved of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then let us pursue the things which tend to peace, and things whereby one shall build up another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the sake of meat do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil to that man who eats while stumbling [in doing so].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[It is] right not to eat meat, nor drink wine, nor [do anything] in which thy brother stumbles, or is offended, or is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hast *thou* faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Blessed [is] he who does not judge himself in what he allows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he that doubts, if he eat, is condemned; because [it is] not of faith; but whatever [is] not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
