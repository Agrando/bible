And on that day there arose a great persecution against the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and all were scattered into the countries of Judaea and Samaria except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And pious men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into the houses one after another, and dragging off both men and women delivered them up to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those then that had been scattered went through [the countries] announcing the glad tidings of the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, preached the Christ to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the crowds with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip, when they heard [him] and saw the signs which he wrought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For from many who had unclean spirits they went out, crying with a loud voice; and many that were paralysed and lame were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a certain man, by name Simon, had been before in the city, using magic arts, and astonishing the nation of Samaria, saying that himself was some great one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom they had all given heed, from small to great, saying, This is the power of God which is called great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they gave heed to him, because that for a long time he had astonished them by his magic arts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip announcing the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Simon also himself believed; and, having been baptised, continued constantly with Philip; and, beholding the signs and great works of power which took place, was astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the apostles who were in Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who, having come down, prayed for them that they might receive [the] Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for he was not yet fallen upon any of them, only they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Simon, having seen that by the laying on of the hands of the apostles the [Holy] Spirit was given, offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, Give to me also this power, in order that on whomsoever I may lay hands he may receive [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Peter said to him, Thy money go with thee to destruction, because thou hast thought that the gift of God can be obtained by money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not upright before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and supplicate the Lord, if indeed the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for I see thee to be in the gall of bitterness, and bond of unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Simon answering said, Supplicate *ye* for me to the Lord, so that nothing may come upon me of the things of which ye have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They therefore, having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and announced the glad tidings to many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But [the] angel of [the] Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go southward on the way which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza: the same is desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he rose up and went. And lo, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a man in power under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to worship at Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>was returning and sitting in his chariot: and he was reading the prophet Esaias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Philip, running up, heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and said, Dost thou then know what thou art reading of?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, How should I then be able unless some one guide me? And he begged Philip to come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the passage of the scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb in presence of him that shears him, thus he opens not his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his humiliation his judgment has been taken away, and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the eunuch answering Philip said, I pray thee, concerning whom does the prophet say this? of himself or of some other?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Philip, opening his mouth and beginning from that scripture, announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went along the way, they came upon a certain water, and the eunuch says, Behold water; what hinders my being baptised?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Not available</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he commanded the chariot to stop. And they went down both to the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptised him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But when they came up out of the water [the] Spirit of [the] Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no longer, for he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through he announced the glad tidings to all the cities till he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
