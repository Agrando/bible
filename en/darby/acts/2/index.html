and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elders shall dream with dreams;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>yea, even upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those days will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the sun shall be changed to darkness and the moon to blood, before the great and gloriously appearing day of [the] Lord come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the name of [the] Lord shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazaraean, a man borne witness to by God to you by works of power and wonders and signs, which God wrought by him in your midst, as yourselves know</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>him, given up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye, by [the] hand of lawless [men], have crucified and slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death, inasmuch as it was not possible that he should be held by its power;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for David says as to him, I foresaw the Lord continually before me, because he is at my right hand that I may not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore has my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted; yea more, my flesh also shall dwell in hope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, nor wilt thou give thy gracious one to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou hast made known to me [the] paths of life, thou wilt fill me with joy with thy countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Brethren, let it be allowed to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch David, that he has both died and been buried, and his monument is amongst us unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn to him with an oath, of the fruit of his loins to set upon his throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he, seeing [it] before, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither has he been left in hades nor his flesh seen corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus has God raised up, whereof all *we* are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David has not ascended into the heavens, but he says himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>until I have put thine enemies [to be] the footstool of thy feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Let the whole house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And having heard [it] they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles, What shall we do, brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptised, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all who [are] afar off, as many as [the] Lord our God may call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Those then who had accepted his word were baptised; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fear was upon every soul, and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles' means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all that believed were together, and had all things common,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed them to all, according as any one might have need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And every day, being constantly in the temple with one accord, and breaking bread in [the] house, they received their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God, and having favour with all the people; and the Lord added [to the assembly] daily those that were to be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
