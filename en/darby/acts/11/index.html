And there went with me these six brethren also, and we entered into the house of the man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he related to us how he had seen the angel in his house, standing and saying [to him], Send [men] to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who shall speak words to thee whereby *thou* shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them even as upon us also at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptised with water, but *ye* shall be baptised with [the] Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If then God has given them the same gift as also to us when we had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who indeed was *I* to be able to forbid God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they heard these things they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then indeed God has to the nations also granted repentance to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They then who had been scattered abroad through the tribulation that took place on the occasion of Stephen, passed through [the country] to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But there were certain of them, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who entering into Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, announcing the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And [the] Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go through as far as Antioch:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who, having arrived and seeing the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted all with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he was a good man and full of [the] Holy Spirit and of faith; and a large crowd [of people] were added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went away to Tarsus to seek out Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having found [him], he brought him to Antioch. And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and one from among them, by name Agabus, rose up and signified by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine over all the inhabited earth, which also came to pass under Claudius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they determined, according as any one of the disciples was well off, each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea, to minister [to them];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
