And he said to me, *I* am Jesus the Nazaraean, whom *thou* persecutest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they that were with me beheld the light, [and were filled with fear], but heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise up, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which it is appointed thee to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as I could not see, through the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the law, borne witness to by all the Jews who dwelt [there],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>coming to me and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And *I*, in the same hour, received my sight and saw him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen thee beforehand to know his will, and to see the just one, and to hear a voice out of his mouth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what thou hast seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and have thy sins washed away, calling on his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem, and as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and saw him saying to me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And *I* said, Lord, they themselves know that *I* was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe on thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of them who killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to me, Go, for *I* will send thee to the nations afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a one as that from the earth, for it was not fit he should live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as they were crying, and throwing away their clothes, and casting dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying that he should be examined by scourging, that he might ascertain for what cause they cried thus against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as they stretched him forward with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood [by], Is it lawful for you to scourge a man [who is] a Roman and uncondemned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the centurion, having heard it, went and reported it to the chiliarch, saying, What art thou going to do? for this man is a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the chiliarch coming up said to him, Tell me, Art *thou* a Roman? And he said, Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the chiliarch answered, *I*, for a great sum, bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But *I* was also [free] born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Immediately therefore those who were going to examine him left him, and the chiliarch also was afraid when he ascertained that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And on the morrow, desirous to know the certainty [of the matter] why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and having brought Paul down set him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
