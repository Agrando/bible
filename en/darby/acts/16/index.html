And we were staying in that city certain days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And on the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where it was the custom for prayer to be, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when she had been baptised and her house, she besought [us], saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide [there]. And she constrained us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass as we were going to prayer that a certain female slave, having a spirit of Python, met us, who brought much profit to her masters by prophesying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She, having followed Paul and us, cried saying, These men are bondmen of the Most High God, who announce to you [the] way of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this she did many days. And Paul, being distressed, turned, and said to the spirit, I enjoin thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And her masters, seeing that the hope of their gains was gone, having seized Paul and Silas, dragged [them] into the market before the magistrates;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and having brought them up to the praetors, said, These men utterly trouble our city, being Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and announce customs which it is not lawful for us to receive nor practise, being Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the crowd rose up too against them; and the praetors, having torn off their clothes, commanded to scourge [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having laid many stripes upon them they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and secured their feet to the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison shook, and all the doors were immediately opened, and the bonds of all loosed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the jailor being awakened out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword was going to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And having asked for lights, he rushed in, and, trembling, fell down before Paul and Silas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And leading them out said, Sirs, what must I do that I may be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, with all that were in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed [them] from their stripes; and was baptised, he and all his straightway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having brought them into his house he laid the table [for them], and rejoiced with all his house, having believed in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when it was day, the praetors sent the lictors, saying, Let those men go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the jailor reported these words to Paul: The praetors have sent that ye may be let go. Now therefore go out and depart in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly uncondemned, us who are Romans, they have cast us into prison, and now they thrust us out secretly? no, indeed, but let them come themselves and bring us out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the lictors reported these words to the praetors. And they were afraid when they heard they were Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they came and besought them, and having brought them out, asked them to go out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And having gone out of the prison, they came to Lydia; and having seen the brethren, they exhorted them and went away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
