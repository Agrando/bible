This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called [the mount] of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's journey off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they were come into [the city], they went up to the upper chamber, where were staying both Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [son] of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude [the brother] of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with [several] women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in those days Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said, (the crowd of names [who were] together [was] about a hundred and twenty,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Brethren, it was necessary that the scripture should have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before, by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for he was numbered amongst us, and had received a part in this service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(This [man] then indeed got a field with [the] reward of iniquity, and, having fallen down headlong, burst in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own dialect Aceldama; that is, field of blood.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in [the] book of Psalms, Let his homestead become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it; and, Let another take his overseership.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all [the] time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with us of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they appointed two, Joseph, who was called Barsabas, who had been surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed, and said, Thou Lord, knower of the hearts of all, shew which one of these two thou hast chosen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to receive the lot of this service and apostleship, from which Judas transgressing fell to go to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they gave lots on them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
