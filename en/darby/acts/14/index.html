And on the morrow he went away with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And having announced the glad tidings to that city, and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to abide in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having chosen them elders in each assembly, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having passed through Pisidia they came to Pamphylia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and having spoken the word in Perga, they came down to Attalia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and thence they sailed away to Antioch, whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And having arrived, and having brought together the assembly, they related to them all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they stayed no little time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
