or why do ye gaze on us as if we had by our own power or piety made him to walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom *ye* delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when *he* had judged that he should be let go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But *ye* denied the holy and righteous one, and asked that a man [that was] a murderer should be granted to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but the originator of life ye slew, whom God raised from among [the] dead, whereof *we* are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, by faith in his name, his name has made this [man] strong whom ye behold and know; and the faith which is by him has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, brethren, I know that ye did it in ignorance, as also your rulers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but God has thus fulfilled what he had announced beforehand by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Repent therefore and be converted, for the blotting out of your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from [the] presence of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and he may send Jesus Christ, who was foreordained for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whom heaven indeed must receive till [the] times of [the] restoring of all things, of which God has spoken by the mouth of his holy prophets since time began.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses indeed said, A prophet shall [the] Lord your God raise up to you out of your brethren like me: him shall ye hear in everything whatsoever he shall say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall be that whatsoever soul shall not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And indeed all the prophets from Samuel and those in succession after [him], as many as have spoken, have announced also these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>*Ye* are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God appointed to our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To you first God, having raised up his servant, has sent him, blessing you in turning each one [of you] from your wickedness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
