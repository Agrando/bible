For they were tent-makers by trade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in respect of the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But as they opposed and spoke injuriously, he shook his clothes, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own head: *I* [am] pure; from henceforth I will go to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And departing thence he came to the house of a certain [man], by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said by vision in [the] night to Paul, Fear not, but speak and be not silent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>because *I* am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he remained [there] a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one consent rose against Paul and led him to the judgment-seat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, This [man] persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But as Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it was some wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, of reason I should have borne with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if it be questions about words, and names, and the law that ye have, see to it yourselves; [for] *I* do not intend to be judge of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them from the judgment-seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having all laid hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, they beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio troubled himself about none of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Paul, having yet stayed [there] many days, took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he arrived at Ephesus, and left them there. But entering himself into the synagogue he reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they asked him that he would remain for a longer time [with them] he did not accede,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but bade them farewell, saying, [I must by all means keep the coming feast at Jerusalem]; I will return to you again, if God will: and he sailed away from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And landing at Caesarea, and having gone up and saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having stayed [there] some time, he went forth, passing in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures, arrived at Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in his spirit, he spoke and taught exactly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And *he* began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to [them] and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those who believed through grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
