for that indeed an evident sign has come to pass through their means is manifest to all that inhabit Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But that it be not further spread among the people, let us threaten them severely no longer to speak to any man in this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And having called them, they charged [them] not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answering said to them, If it be righteous before God to listen to you rather than to God, judge ye;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for as for us *we* cannot refrain from speaking of the things which we have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they, having further threatened them, let them go, finding no way how they might punish them, on account of the people, because all glorified God for what had taken place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for the man on whom this sign of healing had taken place was above forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having been let go, they came to their own [company], and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they, having heard [it], lifted up [their] voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who hast said by the mouth of thy servant David, Why have [the] nations raged haughtily and [the] peoples meditated vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with [the] nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in this city</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined before should come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy servant Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had believed were one, and not one said that anything of what he possessed was his own, but all things were common to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and with great power did the apostles give witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For neither was there any one in want among them; for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought the price of what was sold</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and laid it at the feet of the apostles; and distribution was made to each according as any one might have need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is, being interpreted, Son of consolation), a Levite, Cyprian by birth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>being possessed of land, having sold [it], brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
