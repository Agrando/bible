But it was certain Jews from Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who ought to appear before thee and accuse, if they have anything against me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me when I stood before the council,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[other] than concerning this one voice which I cried standing amongst them: I am judged this day by you touching [the] resurrection of [the] dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Felix, knowing accurately the things concerning the way, adjourned them, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch is come down I will determine your affair;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>ordering the centurion to keep him, and that he should have freedom, and to hinder none of his friends to minister to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after certain days, Felix having arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he reasoned concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment about to come, Felix, being filled with fear, answered, Go for the present, and when I get an opportunity I will send for thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>hoping at the same time that money would be given him by Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener and communed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when two years were completed, Felix was relieved by Porcius Festus as his successor; and Felix, desirous to oblige the Jews, to acquire their favour, left Paul bound.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
