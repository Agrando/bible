And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and urged him to go up against Ramoth-Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-Gilead? And he said to him, I am as thou, and my people as thy people; and [I will be] with thee in the war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire, I pray thee, this day of the word of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the king of Israel assembled the prophets, four hundred men, and said to them, Shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, and God will give it into the king's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Jehovah besides, that we might inquire of him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of Jehovah; but I hate him, for he prophesies no good concerning me, but always evil: [it is] Micah the son of Imlah. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king of Israel called a chamberlain, and said, Fetch quickly Micah the son of Imlah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, having put on their robes, sat each on his throne; and they sat in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said, Thus saith Jehovah: With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have exterminated them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-Gilead, and prosper; for Jehovah will give it into the king's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the messenger that went to call Micah spoke to him saying, Behold, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one assent: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and declare good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Micah said, As Jehovah liveth, even what my God shall say, that will I declare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he came to the king. And the king said to him, Micah, shall we go against Ramoth-Gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they will be given into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but truth in the name of Jehovah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And Jehovah said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he prophesies no good concerning me, but evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Hear ye therefore the word of Jehovah: I saw Jehovah sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Jehovah said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-Gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before Jehovah and said, I will entice him. And Jehovah said unto him, Wherewith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt entice [him], and also succeed: go forth, and do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, behold, Jehovah has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and Jehovah has spoken evil concerning thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micah upon the cheek, and said, Which way now went the Spirit of Jehovah from me to speak to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Micah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and ye shall say, Thus says the king: Put this [man] in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Micah said, If thou return at all in peace, Jehovah has not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O peoples, all of you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king of Syria commanded the captains of his chariots saying, Fight neither with small nor great, but with the king of Israel only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, That is the king of Israel; and they surrounded him to fight; and Jehoshaphat cried out, and Jehovah helped him; and God diverted them from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And a man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the fastenings and the corslet. And he said to the charioteer, Turn thy hand and drive me out of the camp; for I am wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the battle increased that day; and the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
