And the Levites took it to carry it forth into the brook Kidron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they began on the first of the first month to hallow, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Jehovah; and they hallowed the house of Jehovah eight days; and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they went in to king Hezekiah, and said, We have cleansed all the house of Jehovah, and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the table of the [bread] to be set in rows, and all its vessels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and all the vessels that king Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression have we prepared and hallowed, and behold, they are before the altar of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats for a sin-offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of Aaron to offer [them] upon the altar of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they slaughtered the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar; and they slaughtered the rams, and sprinkled the blood on the altar; and they slaughtered the lambs, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they brought near the he-goats of the sin-offering before the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the priests slaughtered them, and they made purification for sin with their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel; because for all Israel, said the king, is the burnt-offering and the sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he set the Levites in the house of Jehovah with cymbals, with lutes, and with harps, according to the commandment of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of Jehovah through his prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hezekiah commanded to offer up the burnt-offering on the altar. And at the moment the burnt-offering began, the song of Jehovah began, and the trumpets, accompanied by the instruments of David king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded, all [the time] until the burnt-offering was finished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they had ended offering the burnt-offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And king Hezekiah and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise to Jehovah with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and bowed their heads and worshipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves to Jehovah, come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of the Lord. And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart, burnt-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the number of the burnt-offerings, which the congregation brought, was seventy bullocks, a hundred rams, two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Only the priests were too few, and they could not flay all the burnt-offerings; therefore their brethren the Levites helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests had hallowed themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to hallow themselves than the priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for the burnt-offering. And the service of the house of Jehovah was set in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people; for the thing was done suddenly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
