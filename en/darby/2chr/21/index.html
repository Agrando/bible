Then Libnah revolted at the same time from under his hand, because he had forsaken Jehovah the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover he made high places on the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah [thereto].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet saying, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of David thy father: Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, like the fornications of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren, thy father's house who were better than thyself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>behold, Jehovah will smite with a great stroke thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy substance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and thyself with sore sicknesses, with a disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehovah stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, who [are] near the Ethiopians;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they came up into Judah, and broke into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was no son left him, except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after all this, Jehovah smote him in his bowels with an incurable sickness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, from day to day, and at the time when the second year was drawing to a close, that his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness, and he died in cruel sufferings. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being regretted. And they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
