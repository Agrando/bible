Therefore is wrath upon thee from Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Nevertheless there are good things found in thee; for thou hast put away the Asherahs out of the land, and hast directed thy heart to seek God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he set judges in the land throughout the fortified cities of Judah, city by city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to the judges, Take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah, who will be with you in the matter of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now, let the terror of Jehovah be upon you; be careful what ye do, for there is no iniquity with Jehovah, nor respect of persons, nor taking of presents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set some of the Levites and priests, and of the chief fathers of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah and for causes.
