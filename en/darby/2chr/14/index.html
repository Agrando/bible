And Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Asa did what was good and right in the sight of Jehovah his God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he took away the altars of the strange [gods] and the high places, and broke the columns, and cut down the Asherahs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and commanded Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to practise the law and the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he removed out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images; and the kingdom was quiet before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because Jehovah had given him rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and surround them with walls and towers, gates and bars, while the land is yet before us; for we have sought Jehovah our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. And they built and prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Asa had an army that bore targets and spears: out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew the bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these, mighty men of valour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Zerah the Ethiopian came out against him with a host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots, and he came to Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah near Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Asa cried unto Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, it maketh no difference to thee to help, whether there be much or no power: help us, O Jehovah our God, for we rely on thee, and in thy name have we come against this multitude.
