If indeed even without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The then supplying to you the spirit, and working miracles among you, on account of works of law, or on account of obedience of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>even as Abraham believed in the God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Know you certainly, that those of faith, these are sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Having before seen and the writing, that by faith justifies the nations the God, before announced glad tidings to the Abraham: That shall be blessed in thee all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So that those of faith, are blessed with the believing Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As many as for of works of law are, under a curse they are; it has been written for: That accursed every one who not continues in all things those having been written in the book of the law, of the to have done them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That but by law no one is justified before the God, clear; because the just by faith, shall live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the but law not is of faith; but the one having done these things, shall live by them. Galatians</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Anointed us bought off from the curse of the law, having become on behalf of us a curse; (it has been written for: Accursed every one he being hung on a tree;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>so that for the nations the blessing of the Abraham might be in Anointed Jesus, that the annunciation of the spirit we might receive through the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brethren, according to man I speak; though of a man having been ratified a covenant no one sets aside or superadds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the now Abraham were spoken the promises, even for the seed of him. Not he says: And to the seeds as concerning many, but as concerning one. And to the seed of thee; who is Anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This but I say; a covenant previously ratified by the God concerning Anointed, that after four hundred and thirty years having become a law not annuls, so as the to have canceled the promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>if for by law the inheritance, no longer by promise; to the but Abraham through promise has freely given the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then the law? The transgressions on account of it was appointed, (to which time should have come the seed, to whom it has been promised,) having been instituted by means of messengers, in hand of mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The but mediator of one not he is; the but God one is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The then law contrary to the promises of the God? Not let it be. If for was given a law that being able to have made alive, truly by law was the righteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but shut up together the scripture the all things under sin, in order that the promise by faith of Jesus Anointed might be given to the believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Before the but to have come the faith, under law we were guarded being shut up together for the being about faith to have been revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So that the law a childleader of us has become, to Anointed, that by faith we might be justified;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>having come but the faith, no longer under a childleader we are. Galatians</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All for sons of God you are through the faith in Anointed Jesus; Galatians</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>as many as for into Anointed were dipped, Anointed you were clothed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Not there is a Jew, nor a Greek; not there is a slave, nor a freeman; not there is male and female; all for you one are in Anointed Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>if but you of Anointed, certainly of the Abraham seed you are, and according to promise heirs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
