It was and a sabbath in that the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Said then the Jews to the having been healed: A sabbath it is; not it is lawful for thee to carry the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them: He having made a sound, he to me said: Take up the bed of thee, and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They asked then him: Who is the man, he saying to thee: Take up the bed of thee, and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He but having been cured not knew who it is; the for Jesus slipped out, a crowd being in the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After these finds him the Jesus in the temple, and said to him: See, sound thou hast become; no longer do thou sin, that so worse to thee anything may happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Went away the man, and told to the Jews, that Jesus it is, he having made him sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And through this persecuted the Jesus the Jews, because these he did in a sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The and Jesus answered them: The father of me till now works, and I work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Through this therefore more sought him the Jews to kill, because not only he was breaking the sabbath, but also a Father his own said the God, equal himself making to the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Answered then the Jesus and said to them: Indeed indeed I say to you, not is able the son to do of himself nothing, if not anything he may see the Father doing; what for ever he may do, these also the son in like manner does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The for Father loves the son, and all shows to him, what he does; and greater of these shows to him works, so that you may wonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As for the Father raises the dead ones and makes alive; thus also the son, whom he will, makes alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Not even for the Father judges any one; but the judgment all has given to the son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>so that all may honor the son, even as they honor the Father.
