The but Jesus down stooping, with the finger wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When but they continued asking him, having raised up he said to them: He without sin of you, first the stone on her let him cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again down stooping, wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They and having heard, and by the conscience being convinced, went out one by one, beginning from the elders even to the last ones; and left alone the Jesus, and the woman in middle standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Having raised up and the Jesus, and no one seeing but the woman, said to her: The woman, where are those the accusers of thee? no one thee condemned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She and said: No one, O lord. Said and to her the Jesus: Neither I thee condemn; go, and no longer do thou sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Again therefore the Jesus to them spoke, saying: I am the light of the world; he following me, not not shall walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of the life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Said therefore to him the Pharisees: Thou concerning thyself dost testify; the testimony of thee not is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Answered Jesus and said to them: Even if I testify concerning myself, true is the testimony of me; because I know, whence I came, and where I go; you but not know, whence I came, or where I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You according to the flesh judge, I not judge no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Even if judge but I, the judgment the my true is; because alone not I am, but I and the having sent me Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Also in the law and the your it has been written: That two of men the testimony true is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am he testifying concerning myself, and testifies concerning me the having sent me Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They said then to him: Where is the father of thee? Answered Jesus: Neither me you know, nor the Father of me. If me you knew, also the Father of me you would know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These the words he spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one seized him, because not yet had come the hour of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Said therefore again to them the Jesus: I go away, and you will seek me, and in the sin of you you will die; where I go, you not are able to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Said then the Jews: Not will he kill himself, because he says: Where I go, you not are able to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them: You from the beneath are, I from the above am; you from the world this are, I not am from the world this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said therefore to you, that you will die in the sins of you; if for not you may believe, that I am, you will die in the sins of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said therefore to him: Thou who art? And said to them the Jesus: The beginning what, what even I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Many things I have about you to say, and to judge; but he having sent me true is; and I what I heard from him, these things I say to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Not they knew, that the Father to them he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Said then to them the Jesus: When you may left up the son of the man, then you will know that I am; and from myself I do nothing, but as taught me the Father of me these things I say;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and he having sent me, with me is; not left me alone the Father, because I the things pleasing to him do always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>These of him speaking, many believed into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Said then the Jesus to those having believed him Jews: If you may abide in the word the my, truly disciples of me you are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make free you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him: Seed of Abraham we are, and to no one have we been slaves at any time; how thou sayest: That free you shall become?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Answered them the Jesus: Indeed indeed I say to you, that every one who is doing the sin, a slave is of the sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The but slave not abides in the house to the age; the son abides to the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If then the son you may make free, really free you shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know, that seed of Abraham you are; but you seek me to kill, because the word the mine not has place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I what have seen from the Father of me, I speak; and you therefore what you have seen from the father of you, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said to him: The father of us Abraham is. Says to them the Jesus: If children of the Abraham you are, the works of the Abraham you would do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now but you seek me to kill, a man, who the truth to you has spoken, which I have heard from the God; this Abraham not did. You do the works of the father of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They said then to him: We from fornication not have been born; one father we have, the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Said to them the Jesus: If the God a father of you was, you would love me; I for from the God came out and am come; not even for of myself I have come, but he me sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why the speech the mine not know you? Because not you are able to hear the word the mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You from the father the accuser are, and the lusts of the father of you you wish to do. He a manslayer was from a beginning, and in the truth not has stood; because not is truth in him. When may speak the falsehood, from the own he speaks; because a liar is, also the father of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>I but because the truth I speak, not you believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who of you convicts me concerning sin? If truth I speak, why you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He being from the God, the words of the God hears; through this you not hear, because from the God not you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Answered the Jews and said to him: Not well say we, that a Samaritan art thou, and a demon thou hast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Answered Jesus: I a demon not have, but I honor the Father of me, and you dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>I but not seek the glory of me; it is he seeking and judging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Indeed indeed I say to you, if any one the word the mine may keep, death not not he may see to the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Said then to him the Jews: Now we know, that a demon thou hast; Abraham died and the prophets, and thou sayest: If any one the word of me may keep, not not may taste of death to the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Not thou greater art of the father of us Abraham, who died? and the prophets died; whom thyself makest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Answered Jesus: If I glorify myself, the glory of me nothing is. He is the Father of me he glorifying me, whom you say, that a God of you he is,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and not you know him; I but know him. And if I say, that not I know him, I shall be like you, a liar. But I know him, and the word of him I keep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Abraham the father of you ardently desired, that he might see the day the my; and he saw, and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Said then the Jews to him: Fifty years not yet thou art, and Abraham hast thou seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Said to them the Jesus: Indeed indeed I say to you, before Abraham to have been born, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>They took up therefore stones, that they might cast on him; Jesus but hid himself, and went out of the temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
