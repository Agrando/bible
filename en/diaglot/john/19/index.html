And he says to them: See the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When therefore saw him the highpriests and officers, they cried out saying: Crucify, crucify him. Says to them the Pilate: Take him you, and crucify; I for not find in him a fault.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Answered him the Jews: We a law have, and according to the law of us he ought to die, because himself, a son of God he made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When therefore heard the Pilate this the word, more he was afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and went into the judgment hall again, and says to the Jesus: Whence art thou? The but Jesus an answer not gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Says then to him the Pilate: To me not thou doest speak? not knowest thou, that authority I have to crucify thee; and authority I have to release thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Answered Jesus: Not thou couldst have authority not any against me, if not it was to thee having been given from above; on account of this he delivering up me to thee, greater sin has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From this seeks the Pilate to release him. The but Jews cried out, saying: If this thou release, not thou art a friend of the Caesar; every one the king himself making, speaks against the Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The therefore Pilate having heard this the word, brought out the Jesus, and sat down on the tribunal into a place being called Pavement, in Hebrew but Gabbatha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(it was and a preparation of the passover, hour and about sixth;) and he says to the Jews: See the king of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They but cried out: Away, away; crucify him. Says to them the Pilate: The king of you shall I crucify? Answered the highpriests: Not we have a king, if not Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then therefore he delivered up him to them, that he might be crucified. They took and the Jesus and led.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And carrying the cross of himself, he went out into the being called of a skull a place, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Where him they crucified, and with him others two, hence and hence, in middle and the Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wrote and also a title the Pilate, and placed upon the cross. It was and having been written: Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This therefore the title many read of the Jews, because near was the place of the city, where was crucified the Jesus; and it was having been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Latin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Said therefore to the Pilate the highpriests of the Jews: Not write thou: The king of the Jews; but that he said: A king I am of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Answered the Pilate: What I have written, I have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The then soldiers, when they crucified the Jesus, took the mantles of him, (and made four parts, to each soldier a part,) and the coat. Was but the coat without seam, from the top woven throughout whole;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>they said then to each other: Not let us tear him, but we may cast lots about him, of whom it shall be. That the writing might be fulfilled that saying: They divided the mantles of me for themselves, and on the raiment of me they cast a lot. The indeed therefore soldiers these things did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Stood now by the cross of the Jesus the mother of him, and the sister of the mother of him, Mary that of the Klopas, and Mary the Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus therefore seeing the mother, and the disciples standing by, whom he loved, he says to the mother of himself: O woman, lo, the son of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he says to the disciples: Lo, the mother of thee. And from that the hour took the disciple her into the own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this knowing the Jesus, that all things already had been finished that might be finished the writing, says: I thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A vessel therefore stood of vinegar full; they and filling a sponge of vinegar, and to a hyssopstalk putting round, brought of him to the mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When therefore took the vinegar the Jesus said: It has been finished; and having inclined the head, he gave up the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The then Jews (that not might remain on the cross the bodies in the sabbath; since a preparation it was; was for great the day that of the sabbath) asked the Pilate, that might be broken of them the legs, and they might be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Came therefore the soldiers, and of the indeed first, they brake the legs, and of the other that having been crucified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>To but the Jesus having come, when they saw him already having died, not they broke of him the legs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but one of the soldiers with a spear of him the side pierced, and immediately came out blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he having seen has testified, and true of him is the testimony; and he knows, that rue things he says, so that also you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Occurred for these things, that the writing might be fulfilled: A bone not shall be broken of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another writing says: They shall look into whom they pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After and these things, asked the Pilate the Joseph that from Arimathea, (being a disciple of the Jesus, having been hid but through the fear of the Jews,) that he might take away the body of the Jesus, and permitted the Pilate. He came therefore and took away the body of the Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Came and also Nicodemus, (the having come to the Jesus by night the first,) bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes about pounds a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They took therefore the body of the Jesus, and bound it with linen cloths with the spices, as customary it is with the Jews to embalm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Was and in the place, where he was crucified, a garden, and in the garden a tomb new, in which not yet no one was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There therefore on account of the preparation of the Jews, because near was the tomb, they laid the Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
