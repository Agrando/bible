They say to him: O lord, come, and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Wept the Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Said then the Jews: See, how he loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Some but of them said: Not was able this, he having opened the eyes of the blind to have caused, that even this not should die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus therefore again being agitated in himself, comes to the tomb.

The but Jesus lifted up the eyes above, and said: O Father, I give thanks to thee, that thou didst hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I and knew, that always me thou hearest; but on account of the crowd that standing I spoke, so that they may believe, that thou me has sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And these things saying, with a voice loud he cried out: O Lazarus, come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Came out he having been dead, having been bound the feet and the hands with bandages, and the face of him with a napkin bound about. Says to them the Jesus: Loose you him, and allow to go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many therefore of the Jews, those having come to the Mary, and having gazed upon what he did, believed into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Some but of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what did the Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Assembled then the highpriests and the Pharisees a high council, and said: What are we doing? because this the man many signs does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we allow him thus, all will believe into him; and will come the Romans, and will take away of us both the place and the nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>One and a certain of them, Caiaphas, highpriest being of the year that, said to them: You not know nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Neither do you consider, that it is better for us, that one man should die in behalf of the people, and not whole the nation should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>This but from himself not he said; but highpriest being of the year that, he prophesied, that was about Jesus to die in behalf of the nation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not in behalf of the nation alone, but that also the children of the God those having been scattered he should gather into one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>From that therefore the day they took counsel together, that they might kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus therefore no longer publicly walked among the Jews, but went away thence into the country near the desert, into Ephraim being called a city; and there remained with the disciples of himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Was and near the passover the Jews; and went up many into Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They sought then the Jesus, and said with each other in the temple standing: What think you? that not not he may come to the feast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Had given now both the highpriests and the Pharisees a commandment, that if any one should know where he is, he should show, how they might seize him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
