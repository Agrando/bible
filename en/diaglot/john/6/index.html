And the bread also, which I will give, the flesh of me is, which I will give in behalf of the world life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Were contending therefore with one another the Jews, saying: How is able this to us to give the flesh to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Said them to them the Jesus: Indeed indeed I say to you, if not you may eat the flesh of the son of the man, and you may drink of him the blood, not have life in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He eating of me the flesh, and drinking of me the blood, has life agelasting; and I will raise up him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The for flesh of me truly is food, and the blood of me truly is drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He eating of me the flesh, and drinking of me the blood, in me abides, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As sent me the living Father, and I live through the Father; also he eating me, even he shall live through me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread, that from the heaven having come down; not as ate the fathers of you, and died; he eating this the bread, shall live into the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>These things he said in a synagogue teaching in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Many therefore having heard of the disciples of him, said: Hard is this the saying; who is able it to hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Knowing but the Jesus in himself, that were murmuring about this the disciples of himself, he said to them: This you offends?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>If then you should see the son of the man ascending, where he was the first?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The spirit is that making alive; the flesh not profits nothing. The words, which I speak to you, spirit is and life is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But are of you some, who not believe; knew for from beginning the Jesus, some are who not believing, and who is he about betraying him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And he said: Through this I have said to you that no one is able to come to me, if not may be having been given to him from the Father of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>From this many went the disciples of him into the things behind; and no longer with him were walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Said therefore the Jesus to the twelve: Not and you wish to go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Answered him Simon Peter: O lord, to whom shall we go? words of life agelasting thou hast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and we have believed and have known, that thou art the holy one of the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Answered them the Jesus: Not I you the twelve choose? and of you one an accuser is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He spoke now the Judas of Simon Iscariot; this for was about him to deliver up, one being of the twelve.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
