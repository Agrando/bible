Answered the Jesus: Thou sayest; that a king am I. I for this have been born, and for this I have come into the world, that I may testify to the truth. Every one who being of the truth, hears of me the voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Says to him the Pilate: What is truth? And this saying, again he went out to the Jews, and says to them: I not one fault find in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>It is but a custom for you, that one to you I release in the passover; are you willing therefore, to you I release the king of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They cried out then again all saying: Not this, but the Barabbas. Was now the Barabbas a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
