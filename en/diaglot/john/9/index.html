He went away therefore, and washed himself, and came seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The then neighbors, and those seeing him the before, because a beggar he was, said: Not this is he sitting and begging?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Others said: That this is. Others but: That like him it is. He said: That I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They said then to him: How were opened of thee the eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Answered he and said: A man, being named Jesus, clay made, and rubbed of me the eyes, and said to me: Go into the Siloam, and wash thyself.

He says: Not I know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They bring him to the Pharisees, that once blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It was and a sabbath, when the clay made the Jesus, and opened of him the eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Again therefore asked him also the Pharisees, how he obtained sight. He and said to them: Clay he put of me on the eyes, and I washed myself, and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Said therefore of the Pharisees some: This the man not is from the God, because the sabbath not he keeps. Others said: How is able a man a sinner such signs to do? And a division was among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say to the blind again: Thou what sayest concerning him, seeing that he opened of thee the eyes? He and said: That a prophet he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Not believed therefore the Jews concerning him, that blind he was, and obtained sight, till when they called the parents of him the having obtained sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they asked them, saying: This is the son of you, whom you say, that blind he was born? how then now he sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Answered them the parents of him and said: We know, that this is the son of us, and that blind he was born;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>how but now he sees, not we know; or who opened of him the eyes, we not know, he full age has, him ask you; he concerning himself shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things said the parents of him, because they feared the Jews. Already for had agreed the Jews, that if any one him should confess Anointed, from a synagogue should be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Through this the parents of him said: That full age he has, him ask you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They called therefore a second time the man, who was blind, and said to him: Give glory to the God; we know, that the man this a sinner is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Answered then he and said: If a sinner he is, not I know; one I know, that blind being, now I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said and to him again: What did he to thee? how opened of thee the eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them: I said to you already, and not you did hear; why again do you wish to hear? not also you wish of him disciples to be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They reviled him, and said: Thou art a disciple of him; we but of the Moses are disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know, that to Moses has spoken the God; this but not we know whence is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Answered the man and said to them: In for this a wonder is, that you not know whence he is, and he has opened of me the eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know but, that sinners the God not hears; but if any one a worshipper of God may be, and the will him may do, this he hears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>From the age not it was heard, that opened any one eyes of blind having been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If not was this from God, not were able to do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said to him: In sins thou wast born wholly; and thou teachest us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heard the Jesus, that they cast him out; and having found him, said to him: Thou believest into the son of the God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Answered he and said: And who is he, O sir, that I may believe into him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Said and to him the Jesus: Even thou hast seen him, and he talking with thee, he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He and said: I believe, O sir; and he prostrated to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And said the Jesus: For judgment I into the world this came, that those not seeing might see, and those seeing blind might become.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And heard of the Pharisees these things those being with him, and said to him: Not also we blind are?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Said to them the Jesus: If blind you were, not you would have sin; now but you say: That we see; the therefore sin of you remains.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
