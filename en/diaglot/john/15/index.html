As the branch not is able fruit to bear of itself, if not it may abide in the vine; so neither you, if not in me you abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, you the branches. He abiding in me, and I am in him, this bears fruit much; because apart from me not you are able to do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If not any one may abide in me, he is cast out, like the branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and into a fire they cast, and it is burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you abide in me and the words of me in you may abide, whatever you may wish you shall ask, and it shall be for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In this was glorified the Father of me, that fruit much you might bear, and you shall be to me disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As loved me the Father, and I loved you; abide you in the love the mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If the commandments of me you may keep, you will abide in the love of me; as I the commandments of the Father of me have kept, and abide of him in the love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things I have spoken to you, that the joy the mine in you may abide, and the joy of you may be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is the commandment the mine, that you love each other, as I loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater of this love no one has, that any one the life of himself may lay down in behalf of the friends of himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You friends of me are, if you may do what things I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No more you I call slaves; because the slaves not knows what does of him the lord; you but I have called friends, because all things which I heard from the Father of me, I made known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Not you me did choose, but I chose you, and appointed you, that you might go and fruit might bear, and the fruit of you might abide; so that whatever you may ask the Father in the name of me, he may give to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things I command you, that you may love each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world you hates, you know, that me before you it has hated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If of the world you were, the world would the own kiss, because but of the world not you are, but I chose you out of the world, on account of this hates you the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember you the world, of which I said to you.
