These things but to you from a beginning not I said, because with you I was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now but I go to him having sent me, and no one of you asks me: Where goest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because these things I have spoken to you, the sorrow has filled of you the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I the truth say to you; it is better for you, that I should go away. If for not I should go away, the helper not will come to you; if but I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having come he will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Concerning sin indeed, because not they believe into me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>concerning righteousness but, because to the Father of me I go away, and no more you behold me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>concerning and judgment, because the ruling of the world this has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet many things I have to say to you, but not you are able to bear now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When but many may come he the spirit of the truth, he will lead you into all the truth. Not for he will speak from himself, but whatever he may hear, he will speak, and the things coming he will declare to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He me will glorify, because out of the mine will take, and will declare to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things what was the Father, mine is. On account of this I said, that out of the mine he takes, and declares to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while, and not you see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, because I am going to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Said then of the disciples of him to each other: What is this which he says to us: A little while, and not you see me; and again a little while and you shall see me; and: Because I am going to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore: This what is which he says, the little while? Not we know what he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Knew the Jesus, that they wish him to ask, and said to them: Concerning this inquire you with each other, because I said: A little while, and not you see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Indeed indeed I say to you, that will weep and will lament you, the but world will rejoice; you and will be sorrowful, but the sorrow of you into joy shall become.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The woman when she may bear, sorrow has, because has come the hour of her; when but she may have borne the child, no more she remembers of the distress, on account of the joy, that was born a man into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you therefore sorrow indeed now have; again but I will see you, and will be rejoiced of you the heart, and the joy of you no one takes from you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and in that the day me not you will ask nothing; Indeed indeed I say to you, that whatever you may ask the Father in the name of me, he will give to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Till now not you asked nothing in the name of me; ask you, and you shall receive, so that the joy of you may be completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things in figures I have spoken to you; comes an hour, when no more in figures I will speak to you, but plainly concerning the Father i will tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that the day in the name of me you will ask; and not I say to you, that I will entreat the Father concerning you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>himself for the Father loves you, because you me have loved and have believed, that I from the God came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came out from the Father, and have come into the world; again I leave the world; and am going to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Say to him the disciples of him: Lo, now plainly thou speakest, and a figure not one thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know, that thou knowest all things, and no need has, that any one thee should ask; in this we believe, that from God thou didst come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Answered them the Jesus: Now do you believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Lo, comes an hour, and now is come, that you will be scattered every one to the own, and me alone you may leave; and not I am alone, because the Father with me is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things I have spoken to you, that in me peace you may have.
