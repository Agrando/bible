the but Lazarus one was of those reclining with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The then Mary having taken a pound of balsam of spikenard genuine of great price, anointed the feet of the Jesus, and wiped with the hairs of herself the feet of him; the and house was filled with the odor of the balsam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Says therefore one of the disciples of him, Judas of Simon Iscariot, he being about him to deliver up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why this the balsam not sold three hundred denarii, and given to poor ones?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said now this, not because about the poor it concerned him, but because a thief he was, and the box he had, and the things being put in he carried off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Said therefore the Jesus: Let alone her; for the day of the embalming of me she has kept it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The poor for always you have with yourselves, me but not always you have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Knew therefore a crowd great of the Jews, that there he is; and they came not on account of the Jesus alone; but that also the Lazarus they might see, whom he raised out of dead ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Took counsel but the highpriests, that also the Lazarus they might kill;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because many on account of him went away of the Jews, and believed into the Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the morrow a crowd great, who having come to the feast, having heard, that was coming Jesus into Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>they took the branches of the palmtrees, and went out to a meeting with him, and cried out: Hosanna, worthy of blessing he coming in name of Lord, the king of the Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Finding and the Jesus a young ass, he sat on it, as it is having been written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Not fear, O daughter of Sion; lo, the king of thee comes sitting on a foal of an ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These things now not knew the disciples of him the first; but when was glorified the Jesus, then they remembered, that these things was about him having been written, and these things they did to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Testified then the crowd, that being with him, that the Lazarus he called out of the tomb, and raised him out of dead ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On account of this also met him the crowd, because they heard this him to have done the sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The then Pharisees said to themselves: You see that not you gain nothing; see, the world after him is going away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Were and some Greeks of those going up, that they might worship in the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These therefore came to Philip, that from Bethsaida of the Galilee, and were asking him, saying: O sir, we wish the Jesus to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Come Philip, and says to the Andrew; and again Andrew and Philip say to the Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The but Jesus answered them, saying: Has come the hour, that may be glorified the son of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Indeed indeed I say to you, if not the grain of the wheat falling into the ground should die, he alone abides; if but it may die, much fruit it bears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He loving the life of himself, shall lose her; and he hating the life of himself in the world this, into life agelasting shall keep her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If me may serve any one, me let him follow; and where am I, there also the servant the mine shall be; if any one me may serve, will honor him the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now the soul of me is troubled; and what shall I say? O Father, save me from the hour this? But on account of this I came to the hour this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>O Father, glorify of thee the name. Came then a voice out of the heaven: Both I glorified, and again will glorify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The therefore crowd that standing and hearing, said thunder to have been. Others said: A messenger to him has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Answered the Jesus and said: Not on account of me this the voice had come, but on account of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now a judgment is the world this; now the ruler of the world this, will be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And if I should be lifted up from the earth, all will draw to myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>This but he said, signifying by what death he was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Answered him the crowd: We heard out of the law, that the Anointed abides into the age; and how thou sayest, that it behooves to be lifted up the son of the man? who is this the son of the man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Said then to them the Jesus: Yet a little time the light among you is. Walk you, while the light you have, that not darkness you may overtake; and he walking in the darkness not knows where he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While the light you have, believe into the light, that sons of light you may become. These things spoke the Jesus, and going away he was hid from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So many but of him signs having been done in presence of them not they did believe into him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: O lord, who believed the report of us? and the arm of Lord to whom was it revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>On account of this not they were able to believe; because again said Esaias:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He has blinded of them the eyes, and has hardened of them the heart; so that not they might see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and should turn back, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These things said Esaias, because he saw the glory of him, and spoke concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless truly and of the rulers many believed into him; but on account of the Pharisees not did confess, so that not from synagogues they might be;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>they loved for the glory of the men more, than the glory of the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Jesus and cried and said: He believing into me, not believe into me, but into him having sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and he seeing me, see him having sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I a light into the world have come, that all the believing into me, in the darkness not may abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if any one of me may hear the words, and not may believe, I not judge him; (not for I came, that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>he rejecting me, and not receiving the words of me has that judging him; the word which I spoke, that shall judge him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because I from myself not spoke; but the having sent me Father he me a commandment gave, what I should say and what I should I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know, that the commandment of him life agelasting is. What therefore say I, as has spoken to me the Father, so I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
