I am going to prepare a place for you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and if I should go, and should prepare for you a place, again I am coming, and will receive you to myself; so that where am I, also you may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And where I am going you know, and the way you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Says to him Thomas: O lord, not we know where thou art going? and how are we able the way to know?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Says to him the Jesus: I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father, if not through me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you had known me, also the Father of me you would have known; and from now you know him, and have seen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Says to him Philip: O lord, show to us the Father, and it is enough for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Says to him the Jesus: So long a time with you am I, and not knowest thou me, O Philip?
