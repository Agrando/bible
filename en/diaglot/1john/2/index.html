By this we know, that in him we are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The one saying in him to abide, is bound, as he walked, also himself thus to walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved ones, not a commandment new I write to you, but a commandment old, which you had from a beginning; the commandment the old, is the word which you heard from a beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again a commandment new I write to you, which is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the light the true now shines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The one saying in the light to be, and the brother of himself hating, in the darkness he is till now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The one loving the brother of himself, in the light abides, and a stumblingblock in him not is;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>the but one hating the brother of himself, in the darkness is, and in the darkness walks, and not knows where he goes, because the darkness blinded the eyes of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I write to you, O dear children, because are forgiven to you the sins through the name of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write to you, O fathers, because you have known him from a beginning; I write to you, O young men, because you have overcome the evil one; I write to you, children, because you have known the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I wrote to you, O fathers, because you have known him from a beginning.
