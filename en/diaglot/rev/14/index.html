and the voice which I heard, as of harpers harping on the harps of themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they sing a song new in presence of the throne, and in presence of the four living ones, and of the elders; and no one was able to learn the song, if not the hundred fortyfour thousands, those having been bought from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There are, those with women not were defiled; virgins for they are; these are those following the lamb where ever he may go; these were bought from the men a fruitfruit to the God and to the lamb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and in the mouth of them not was found falsehood; without blame for they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I saw another messenger flying in midheaven, having glad tidings agelasting to proclaim those sitting on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying with a voice great: Fear you the God and give you to him glory, because is come the hour of the judgment of him; and worship you the one having made the heaven and the earth and the sea and fountains of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another messenger followed, saying: It is fallen, is fallen Babylon the great; because of the wine of the wrath of the fornication of herself she was given to drink all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And another messenger third followed them, saying with a voice great: If any one worships the wildbeast and the image of him, and receives a mark on the forehead of himself, or on the hand of himself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>even he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of the God, of that having been mingled unmixed in the cup of the anger of him, and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in presence of the holy messengers and in presence of the lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And smoke of the torment of them for ages of ages rises up; and not they have rest day and night those worshipping the wildbeast and the image of him, and if any one receives the mark of the name of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here patient endurance of the holy ones is, those keeping the commandments of the God, and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice out of the heaven, saying: Write thou: Blessed ones the dead ones those in Lord dying from hence forth; yes, says the spirit, so that they may rest from the labors of themselves; the but works of them follows with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I saw, and lo a cloud white, and on the cloud sitting like a son of man, having on the head of himself a crown golden, and in the hand of himself a sickle sharp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another messenger came forth out of the temple, crying with a voice great to the one sitting on the cloud: Send thou the sickle of thee, and reap thou, because is come the hour of the to reap, because is dry the harvest of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And cast the one sitting on the cloud the sickle of himself on the earth;
