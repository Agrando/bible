And I saw out of the sea a wildbeast coming up, having horns ten and heads seven, and on the horns of him ten diadems, and on the heads of him names of blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the wildbeast which I saw, was like to a leopard, and the feet of him as of a bear, and the mouth of him as a mouth of a lion. And gave to him the dragon the power of himself, and the throne of himself, and authority great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And one of the heads of him as if having been slain to death; and the stroke of the death of him was healed. And wondered whole the earth after the wilds beast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and they did homage to the dragon, because he gave the authority to the wildbeast, and they did homage to the wildbeast, saying: Who like to the wildbeast? and who is able to make war with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and was given to him authority to act months forty two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he opened the mouth of himself for blasphemy against the God, to blaspheme the name of him, and the tabernacle of him, and those in the heaven, tabernacling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was given to him war to make with the holy ones, and to overcome them; and was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And will worship him all those dwelling on the earth, of which not has been written the name in the scroll of the life of the lamb of that having been killed, from a casting down of a world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If any one has an hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If any one captivity leads together, into captivity he shall be led; if any one with a sword will kill, it is necessary him with a sword to be killed.
