They and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again going out about sixth and ninth hour, he did in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>About and the eleventh hour going out, he found others standing, and he says to them: Why here stood you all the day idle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him: Because no one us hired. He says to them: Go also you into the vineyard; and whatever maybe just, you shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Evening and having come on, says the lord of the vineyard to the steward of him: Call the laborers, and give to them the hire, beginning from the last, till the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And having come those about the eleventh hour, received each a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Having then those first, supposed, that more they shall receive; and received also they each a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Having received but they murmured against the householder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying: That these the last one hour worked, and equal to us them thou hast made, to the having endured the burden of the day, and the burning heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He but answering said to one of them: Friend, not I wrong thee; not of a denarius didst thou agree to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take thee thine and go, I wish and to this the last to give as also of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Or not is it lawful to me to do what I will with the my own? or the eye of thee evil is, because I good am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus shall be the last, first; and the first, last. Many for are called, few but chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And going up the Jesus to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples privately in the way, and said to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and the son of the man will be delivered up to the highpriests and scribes; and they will condemn him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and they will deliver up him to the Gentiles for the to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify; and in the third day he will stand up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with the sons of her, prostrating, and asking something from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He and said to her: What wilt thou? She says to him: Say that may sit these the two sons of me, one at right of thee, and one at left of thee, in the kingdom of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Answering but the Jesus said: Not you know, what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup, which I am about to drink? They say to him: We are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he says to them: The indeed cup of me you shall drink; the but to sit at right of me and at left of me, not is mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared by the Father of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And having heard the ten, were angry on account of the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The but Jesus, having called them, said: You know, that the rulers of the nations domineer over them. Not thus great exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Not thus it shall be among you; but whoever may wish among you great to become, let him be of you servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and whoever may wish among you to be first, let him be of you a slave;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>even as the son of the man not came to be served but to serve, and to give the life of him a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And departing of them from Jericho, followed him a crowd great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And lo, two blind men, sitting by the way, hearing that Jesus passes by, cried out, saying: Pity us, O lord, son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The and crowd reproved them, that they might be silent. They but more did cry out, saying: Pity us, O lord, son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And having stopped the Jesus he called them, and said: What do you wish I should do to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They say to him: O lord, that may be opened of us the eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Being moved with pity and the Jesus, he touched the eyes of them; and immediately saw again of them the eyes; and they followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
