Then coming they laid the hands on the Jesus, and they seized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And lo, one of the with Jesus, stretching the hand, drew out the sword of him; and striking the slave of the highpriest, cut off of him the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then says to him the Jesus: Return thee the sword into the place of her; all for the taking a sword, by a sword shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Or thinkest thou, that not I am able now to entreat the Father of me, and will furnish to me more then twelve legions of messengers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How then should be fulfilled the writings, that thus it must be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that the hour said the Jesus to the crowds: As upon a robber came you out with swords and clubs, to take me; every day with you I did sit teaching in the temple, and not you seized me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>This but all has been done, that might be fulfilled the writings of the prophets. Then the disciples all, leaving him, they fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>They and seizing the Jesus, they led to Caiaphas the highpriest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>The but Peter followed him at a distance, to the palace of the highpriest; and having gone in, sat with the attendants, to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The and highpriests and the elders and the highcouncil whole sought false testimony against the Jesus, so that him they might deliver to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And not they found, many falsewitnesses having come. Afterwards but coming two falsewitnesses</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>said: This affirmed; I am able to destroy the temple of the God, and in three days to build it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And rising up the highpriest said to him: Nothing answerest thou? what these of thee testify against?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The but Jesus was silent. And answering the highpriest said to him: I adjure thee by the God of the living, that to us thou tell, if thou art the Anointed, the son of the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Says to him the Jesus: Thou has said. Besides I say to you, from now you shall see the son of the man sitting at right of the power, and coming upon the clouds of the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the highpriest rent the clothes of him, saying: That he blasphemes; what further need have we of witnesses? see, now you heard the blasphemy of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What to you thinks? they and answering said: Liable to death he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spat into the face of him, and beat with the fist him: they and struck with palms of their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying: Prophesy to us, O Anointed, who is he striking thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>The and Peter without sat in the courtyard. And came to him one maidservant, saying: Also thou wast with Jesus of the Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He but denied in presence of them all, saying: Not I know what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Going out and he into the portico, saw him another, and says to those there; also this was with Jesus of the Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with an oath; That not I know the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>After a little and approaching those having stood by, said to the Peter: Certainly also thou of them art; even for the speech of thee manifest thee makes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse, and to swear. That not I know the man. And instantly a cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And remembered the Peter of the word of the Jesus, declaring to him; That before a cock crows, thrice thou wilt deny me. And going out, he wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
