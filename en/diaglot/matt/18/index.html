Necessary for it is to come the snares; but woe to the man to that through whom the snare comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If therefore the hand of thee or the foot of thee insnares thee, cut off them, and cast from thee; good to thee it is to enter into the life lame or a cripple, than two hands or two feet having to be cast into the fire the agelasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if the eye of thee insnares thee, tear out it, and cast from thee; good of thee it is oneeyed into the life to enter, than two eyes having to be cast into the Gehenna of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>See, not you may despise one of the littleones these; I say for to you that the messengers of them in heavens perpetually see the face of the Father of me, that in heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Is come for the son of the man to save the having been lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>What to you seems right? if should have any man a hundred sheep, and should go astray one from them; not leaving the ninetynine upon the mountain, going he seeks that having strayed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he should happen to find it, indeed I say to you, that he rejoices over it more, than over the ninenine, those not having been led astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus not it is will in the presence of the Father of you of that in heavens, that should perish one of the littleones of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If and should in error against thee the brother of thee, go, test him between thee and him alone. If thee he may hear thou hast won the brother of thee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If but not he may hear, take with thee besides one or two; that by mouth two of witnesses or of three may be proved every word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If and he should disregard them, tell thou to the congregation; if and also of the congregation he should disregard, let him be to thee as the Gentile and the taxgather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Indeed i say to you, whatever you may bind on the earth, shall be having been bound in the heaven; and whatever you may loose on the earth, shall be having been loosed in the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say to you, that if two of you may agree upon the earth, about any matter, whatever they may ask, it shall be to them from the Father of me, of that in heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where for are two or three having come together in the my name, there i am in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then coming to him the Peter, said: O lord, how often shall sin against me the brother of me, and I shall forgive him? till seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Says to him the Jesus: Not I say to thee, till seven times, but till seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore this has been compared the kingdom of the heavens to a man king, who wished to settle an account with the slaves of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Having begun and of him to settle, they brought to him one a debtor of ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Not having but of him to pay, ordered him the lord of him to be sold, and the wife of him, and the children, and all as much as he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Falling down therefore the slave he prostrated to him, saying: O lord, have patience with me, and all to thee I will pay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>being moved with pity then the lord of the slave of that, loosed him, and the debt remitted to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Going out but the slave that, found one of the fellowslaves of him, who owned to him a hundred denarii; and seizing him he coked him, saying: Pay to me if any thing thou owest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Falling down therefore the fellowslave of him, besought him, saying: Have patience with me, and all I will pay to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He and not he would; but going away he cast him into prison, till he should pay that he was owing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Seeing and the fellowslaves of him that having been done, were grieved much; and going they related to the lord of them all that having been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then having called him the lord of him, says to him: O slave wicked, all the debt that I remitted to thee, because thou besought me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>not was it binding also thee to have pitied the fellow slave of thee, as also I thee pitied?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And being provoked the lord of him delivered him to the jailors, till he may pay all that owing to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So also the Father of me the heavenly will do to you if not you forgive each one the brother of him from the hearts of you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
