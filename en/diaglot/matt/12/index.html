And coming it finds it being empty, having been swept, and having been set in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then it goes, and takes with itself seven other spirits, more wicked of itself, and they entering finds an abode there; and becomes the last (state) of the man that worse of the first. Thus will be and the generation this the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While and he is talking to the crowds, lo, the mother and the brothers of him stood without, seeking to him to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Said then one to him: Lo, the mother of thee and the brothers of thee without stand, seeking to thee to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He but answering said to the man informing him: Who is the mother of me? and who are the brothers of me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And stretching out the hand of him towards the disciples of him, said: Lo, the mother of me, and the brothers of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Whoever for may do the will of the Father of me, that in heavens, the same of me a brother and a sister and a mother is.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
