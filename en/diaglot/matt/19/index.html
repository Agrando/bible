What then the God has joined together, a man not disunites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him: Why then Moses did enjoin to give a scroll of separation, and to release her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He says to them: That Moses for the hardness of heart of you suffered you to release the wives of you; from a beginning but not it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I say but to you, that whoever may release the wife of him, except for fornication, and may marry another, commits adultery; and he her being released marrying, commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They say to him the disciples of him: If thus is the case of the man with woman, not it is profitable to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He but said to them: Not all admit the word this, but to whom it has been given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There are for eunuchs, who from womb of mother were born so; and there are eunuchs, who were made eunuchs by the men; and there are eunuchs, who made eunuchs themselves on account of the kingdom of the heavens.
