The and Jesus says them: Yes; Never have you read: That out of mouth of babes and of suckling (ones) thou has perfected praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And having left them, he went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Early but, returning into the city, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And seeing a figtree one by the way, he came to her, and nothing found in her except leaves alone; and he says to her: No more by thee fruit may be produced to the age. And withered immediately the figtree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And seeing the disciples wondered, saying: How soon withered the figtree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Answering and the Jesus said to them: Indeed I say to you, if you may have faith, and not should doubt, not only the (miracle) of the figtree you shall do, but also if to the mountain this you should say: Be thou lifted up, and be cast into the sea; it shall be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all, whatever you shall ask in the prayer, believing you shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having come to him into the temple, came to him teaching the highpriests and the elders of the people, saying: By what authority these (things) doest thou? and who to thee gave the authority this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Answering and the Jesus said to them: I will ask you also I word one; which if you may say to me, also I to you will tell, by what authority these (things) I do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the dipping of John whence was? from heaven, or from men? They and reasoned among themselves, saying: If we should say, from heaven; he will say to us: Why then not did you believe to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>if but we should say from men; we fear the crowd; all for hold the John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they answering to the Jesus said: Not we know. Said to them and he: Neither I say to you by what authority these (things) I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>What but to you seems right? A man had children two; and coming to the first, he said: Son, go, today work in the vineyard of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He and answering said: Not I will; afterward but having changed his mind, he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And coming to the other, he said just the same. He and answering said: I lord, and not went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Who of the two did the will of the father? They say to him: The first. Says to them the Jesus: Indeed I say to you, that the taxgatherers and the harlots go before you in the kingdom of the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Came for to you John in a way of righteousness, and not you believed him; the but taxgatherers and the harlots believed him; you and seeing not repented afterwards, of the to believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable hear you; a man was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and a hedge to it placed around, and digged in it a winepress, and built a tower; and let out it to husbandmen, and went abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When and drew near the time of the fruits, he sent the slaves of him, to the husbandmen, to receive the fruits of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And having taken the husbandmen the slaves of him, him indeed they flayed, him and they killed, him and they pelted with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again he sent other slaves, greater the first; and they did to them in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Afterwards and he sent to them the son of him, saying: They will regard the son of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The but husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir; come, we may kill him, and may retain the inheritance of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And having taken him, they cast out of the vineyard, and killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When therefore may come the lord of the vineyard, what will he do to the husbandmen to those?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say to him: Wretches wretchedly destroy them; and the vineyard will let out to other husbandmen, who will render to him the fruits in the seasons of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He says to them the Jesus: Never have you read in the writings: A stone which rejected they building, the same was made into a head of a corner; from Lord was this, and it is wonderful in eyes of us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>On account of this I say to you, that shall be taken from you the kingdom of the God, and shall be given to a nation making the fruits of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he falling on the stone this, shall be broken; on whom but it shall fall, it will crush to pieces him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And having heard the highpriests and the Pharisees the parables of him, knew, that about them he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And seeking him to seize, they feared the crowds; since as a prophet him they held.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
