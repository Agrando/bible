and all the crowds on the shore stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he spake to them much in parables, saying: Lo, went out the sower of the (seed) to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And in the sowing it, some indeed fell on the path; and came the birds, and ate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Others and fell on the rocky ground where not it had earth much; and immediately sprung up, through the not to have a depth of earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>sun and having arisen, it was scorched; and through the not have a root, was dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Others and fell among the thorns; and sprung up the thorns, and coked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Others and fell on the ground the good; and bore fruit, the one a hundred, the other sixty, the other thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He having ear to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And coming the disciples said to him: Why in parables speakest thou to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He and answering said to the: Because to you it is given to know the secrets of the kingdom of the heavens; to them but not it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whoever for has, it shall be given to him, and he will be gifted with abundance; Whoever but not has, even what he has, shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore this in parables to them I speak, for seeing not they see, and hearing not they hear, neither do they understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And is fulfilled to them the prophecy of Esaias, that saying: By hearing you shall hear, and not not may you understand; and seeing you will see, and not not you may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Has grown fat for the heart of the people this, and with the ears heavily they hear, and the eyes of them they shut, lest they should see with the eyes, and with the ears they should hear, and with the heart should understand, and they should turn, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Of you but blessed the eyes for they see; and the ears of you for they hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Indeed for I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see, what you see, and not saw; and to hear, what you hear, and not heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You therefore hear the parable of the sower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Any one hearing the word of the kingdom, and not understanding, comes the wicked (one), and snatches that having been sown in the heart of him; this is, that on the path being sown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That but on the rocky ground being sown, this, who the word hearing and forthwith with joy receiving it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>not he has but a root in himself, but transient is; arising and trial or persecution through the word, immediately he is offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That but into the thorns being sown, this is, who the word hearing, and the care of the age this, and the delusion of the riches chokes the word; and unfruitful becomes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That but on the ground the good being sown, this is, who the word hearing, and understanding; who really bear fruit, and yields, the one a hundred, the other sixty, the other thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable he proposed to them, saying: May be compared the kingdom of the heavens to a man sowing good seed in the field of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In and the to sleep the men, came of him the enemy, and sowed darnel through midst of the wheat; and went forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When and was spring up the blade and fruit yielded, then appeared also the darnel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Coming and the slaves of the householder, said to him: O lord, not good seed didst thou sow in the thy field? whence then has it darnel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He and said to them: An enemy a man this has done. The and slaves said to him: Dost thou wish then going forth we should gather them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said: No; lest, gathering the darnel, you should root up with them the wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Leave them to grow together both till the harvest; and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvesters: Gather you first the darnel, and bind you them into bundles, for the to burn them; the but wheat bring together into the barn of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable he proposed to them, saying: Like is the kingdom of the heavens to a grain of mustard, which taking a man sowed in the field of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Which less indeed is of all of the seeds; when but it may be grown, greater of the herbs is, and becomes a tree, so that to come the birds of the heaven, and to make nests in the branches of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Another parable he spake to them: Like is the kingdom of the heavens to leaven, which taking a woman mixed in of meal measures three, till of it was leavened whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These all spake the Jesus in parables to the crowds, and without a parable not he spake to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so that it might be fulfilled the word spoken through the prophet, say: I will open in parables the mouth of me; I will openly declare things having been hid from a beginning of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then leaving the crowds, went into the house the Jesus. And came to him the disciples of him, saying: Explain to us the parable of darnels of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He and answering said to them: He sowing the good seed, is the son of the man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the and field, is the world; the and good seed, they are the sons of the kingdom; the and darnel, are the sons of the wicked (one);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>the and enemy, he having sown them, is the adversary; the and harvest, end of the age is; the and reapers, messengers are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As therefore are gathered the darnel, and in a fire are burned; so will it he in the end of the age this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Will send the son of the man the messengers of him, and they will gather out of the kingdom of him all the seducers and those working the lawlessness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they will cast them into the furnace of the fire; there shall be a weeping and gnashing of the teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the righteous shall shine, as the sun, in the kingdom of the father of them. He having ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Again like is the kingdom of the heaven to a treasure having been hid in the field, which finding a man be hides, and from the joy of him he goes, and all as much he has sells, and buys the field that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Again like is the kingdom of the heaven to a man a merchant, seeking choice pearls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Finding and one costly pearl, going he sold all as much as he had, and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Again like is the kingdom of the heaven, to a dragÂ–net, being cast into the sea, and of every kind bringing together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which when it is full, drawing to the shore, and sitting down they collected the good into vessels, the but bad away they cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So it will be in the end of the age. Shall go forth the messengers, and shall separate the wicked from among the just,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and shall cast them into the furnace of the fire; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Says to them the Jesus: Have you understood these things all? They say to him: Yes O Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He then said to them: Therefore this every scribe, being instructed to the kingdom of the heavens, like is to a man an householder, who brings out of the treasury of him new and old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it came to pass, when had concluded the Jesus the parables these, he departed thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And coming into the country of him, he taught them in the synagogue of them, so as to astonish them, and to say, Whence this the wisdom this, and these powers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Not this is the of the carpenter son? Not the mother of him is called Mary? and the brothers of him James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and the sisters of him not all with us are? whence then this these all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they found a difficulty in him. The and Jesus said to them: Not is a prophet unhonored, if not in the country of him, and in the house of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And not he did do there mighty works many, because of the unbelief of them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
