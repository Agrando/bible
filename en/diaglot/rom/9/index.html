So be it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not so as but, that has fallen off the word of the God; not for all those from Israel, these Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nor because they are seed of Abraham, all children, but in Isaac shall be called to thee a seed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>this is, not the children of the flesh, these children of the God; but the children of the promise are counted for seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Of promise for the word this: According to the season this I will come, and shall be to the Sarah a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Not only and, but also Rebecca, from one conception having Isaac the father of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not yet for they having been born, nor having done anything good or bad, (so that the according to an election purpose of the God might abide, not from works, but from the one calling.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>it was said to her: That the greater shall be subject to the lesser;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>as it has been written: The Jacob I loved, the but Esau I hated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What then shall we say? not injustice with the God? Not let it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To the for Moses he says: I will pity whom I pity, and compassionate whom I should compassionate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then not of the one willing, nor of the one running, but of the pitying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Says for the writing to the Pharaoh: That for same this I raised up thee, that I might show in thee the power of me, and that may be declared the name of me in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then whom he wills, he pities; whom and he wills, he hardens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say then to me: Why still does he find fault? to the for will of him who has been opposed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But indeed, O man, thou who art, the one answering again to the God? Not shall say the thing formed to the one having formed: Why me madest thou thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or not has authority the potter of the clay, out of the same mixture to make, this indeed for honor a vessel, that and for dishonor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If but wishing the God to show the wrath, and make known the power of himself, bore in much longsuffering vessels of wrath having been fitted for destruction;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and that he might make known the wealth of the glory of himself on vessels of mercy, which were previously prepared for glory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whom even he called us, not only from Jews, but also from Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As also in the Hosea he says: I will call that not a people of me, a people of me; and her not beloved, beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them: Not a people of me you, there they shall be called sons of God living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Esaias but cries on behalf of the Israel: If should be the number of the sons of Israel as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>An account for he is finishing and cutting short in righteousness because an account having been cut short will make a Lord on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as before said Esaias: If not Lord of hosts left to us a seed, as Sodom we should have become, and as Gomorrah we should have been made like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What then shall we say?
