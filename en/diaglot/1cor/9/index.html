Not Jesus Anointed the Lord of us have seen? not the work of me you are in Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If to others not I am an apostle, at all events to you I am; the for seal of the my apostleship you are in Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The my defence to those me condemning, this is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Not not have we a right to eat and to drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Not not have we a right a sister a wife to lead about, as also the others apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or only I and Barnabas not have we a right of the not to work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who serves in war with his own wages any time? who plants a vineyard, and from of the fruit of it not eats? or who tends a flock, and from of the milk of the flock not eats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Not according to man these things I speak? or not and the law these things says?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In for the Moses law it has been written: Not thou shalt muzzle an ox threshing. Not for the oxen cares the God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>or on account of us altogether he says? On account of us for it was written, because in hope it is right he plowing to plow; and he threshing, in hope of that to partake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we to you the spiritual things sowed, a great thing, if we of you the fleshly things shall reap?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others of the of you right partake, not rather we? But not we did use the right this; but all things we endure, so that not hindrance any we may give to the glad tidings of the Anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Not know you, that those the holy things performing, from of the temple eat? those to the altar attending, with the altar are partakers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus also the Lord has appointed for those the glad tidings proclaiming, from of the glad tidings to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I but not have used not one of these things. Not I did write and these things, that thus it may be done to me; well for to me rather to die, than the boasting of me that any one should make void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If for I may announce glad tidings, not it is to me a cause of boasting; necessity for to me lies on; woe for to me is if not I should preach glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If for willing this I do, a reward I have; if but unwilling, a stewardship I have been entrusted with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What then to me is the reward? So that announcing glad tidings without expense I will place the glad tidings of the Anointed, in order that not to fully use the authority of me in the glad tidings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Free for being from all, to all myself I was enslaved, that the more I might gain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and I became to the Jews as a Jew, that Jews I might gain; to those under law as under law, (not being myself under law,) that those under law I might gain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to those without law as without law, (not being without law to God, but within law to Anointed,) that I might gain lawless ones;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I became to the weak as weak, that the weak ones I might gain; to them all I have become the all things, that by all means some I may save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This but I do on account of the glad tidings, that a copartner of it I may become.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not know you, that those in a racecourse running, all indeed run, one but receives the prize? Thus run you, that you may obtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Every one but the contending, all things possesses selfcontrol; they indeed therefore, that a perishable wreath they may receive; we but, an imperishable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I therefore thus run, as not uncertainly; thus I box, as not air beating;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but I browbeat of me the body and lead it captive, lest possibly to others having proclaimed, myself without proof should become.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
