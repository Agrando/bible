(It shall sound for, and the dead ones shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>It is necessary for the incorruptible this to be clothed with incorruption, and the mortal this to be clothed with immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When but the corruptible this shall be clothed with incorruption, and the mortal this shall be clothed with immortality, then will happen the word that having been written: Was swallowed up the death into victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Where of thee, O death, the sting? where of thee, O unseen, the victory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The but sting of the death, the sin; the and power of the sin, the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>To the but God thanks, to the one having given to us, the victory through the Lord of us Jesus Anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Wherefore, brethren of me beloved, steadfast be you, unmovable, abounding in the work of the Lord at all times, knowing, that the labor of you not is vain in Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
