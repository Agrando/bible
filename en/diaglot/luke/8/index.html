Denying and all, said the Peter and those with him: O master, the crowds press on thee and crowd; and sayest thou: Who the having touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The and Jesus said: Touched me some one; I for know a power went out from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Seeing and the woman, that not she was unnoticed trembling came, and falling down to him, through what cause she touched him, related to him in presence of all of the people, and how she was cured immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He and said to her: Take courage, O daughter; the faith of thee has saved thee; go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While of him speaking, comes some one from of the synagoguerulers, saying to him: That is dead the daughter of thee; not trouble thou the teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>The but Jesus having heard, answered him, saying: Not fear; only believe you, and she shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Coming and in to the house, not he suffered to enter no one, except Peter and John and James, and the father of the child and the mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Was weeping and all, and lamenting her. He but said: Not weep you; not she is dead, but sleeps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He but having put out all, and having grasped the hand of her, called out, saying: The child, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And returned the breath of her, and she stood up immediately. And he commanded to her to be given to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And were astonished the parents of her. He but charged them no one to tell that having been done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
