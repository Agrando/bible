What then will do to them the lord of the vineyard?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and will destroy these husbandmen those, and give the vineyard to others. Having heard and they said: Not let it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He but, having looked to them, he said: What then is that having been written this: A stone which rejected of builders, this has been made into a head corner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All the falling upon that the stone, will be bruised; on whom but it may fall, will grind to power him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And sought the highpriests and the scribes to put on him the hands in this the hour; but they feared the people; they knew for, that to them the parable this he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having watched they sent spies, feigning themselves righteous to be; that they might lay hold of him of a word, in order to the to deliver up him to the rule and to the authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, saying: O teacher, we know, that rightly thou speakest and thou teachest, and not thou dost accept a countenance, but in truth the way of the God thou teachest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to Caesar tax to give, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Perceiving but to them the craftiness, he said to them: Why me tempt you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Show you to me a denarius; of whom has it a likeness and inscription? Answering and they said: Of Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He and said to them: Give you back then the things of Caesar, to Caesar; and the things of the God, to the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And not they were able to take hold of him of a word in presence of the people; and wondering at the answer of him, they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Approaching and some of the Sadducees, those denying a resurrection not to be, asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying: O teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any one a brother should die having a wife, and this childless should die, that should take the brother of him the wife, and should raise up seed to the brother of himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Seven now brothers were; and the first having taken a wife, died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And took the second the wife, and this died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the third took her; in like manner and also the seven; not they left children, and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Last and of all died also the woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the therefore resurrection, of which of them will be a wife? the for seven had her a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And answering he said to them the Jesus: The sons of the age this marry and are given marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>those but having been accounted worthy of the age that to obtain, and of the resurrection that out of dead ones, neither marry, nor are given in marriage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>nor for to die more are able; like angels for they are, and sons they are of the God, of the resurrection sons being.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>That but rise the dead ones, even Moses declared at the bush, when he calls a Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>A God now not he is of dead ones, but of living ones; all for to him live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Answering and some of the scribes said: O teacher, well thou hast spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>No longer and they presumed to ask him nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He said and to them: How say they the Anointed a son of David to be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And yet himself David says in a book of psalms: Said the Lord to the lord of me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Sit thou at right hand of me till I may place the enemies of thee a footstool of the feet of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>David therefore a lord him calls, and how a son of him is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Hearing and all of the people, he said to the disciples of himself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Beware of the scribes, those wishing to walk in robes, and loving salutations in the markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places in the feasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>they devour the houses of the widows, and for a show long they pray; the so will receive greater judgment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
