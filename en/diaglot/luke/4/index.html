And not he ate nothing in the days those; and being ended of them, afterwards he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And said to him the accuser: If a son thou art of the God, say to the stone this, that it may become a loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And answered Jesus to him, saying: It is written: That not on bread alone shall live the man, but on every word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And having led up him the accuser into mountain high, he showed to him all the kingdom of the habitable in a moment of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And said to him the accuser: To thee I will give the authority this all, and the glory of them;

and entered, according to the custom to him in the day of the sabbaths, into the synagogue; and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And was delivered to him a roll of Esaias the prophet; and having unrolled the roll, he found the place, where it was having been written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A spirit of a Lord upon me; of which on account of he has anointed me to publish glad tidings to poor ones, he has sent me to publish to captives a deliverance, and to build ones recovery of sight, to sent away those having been crushed in freedom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to publish a year of a Lord acceptable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And having rolled up the roll, having given back to the attendant, he sat down; and of all in the synagogue the eyes were looking steadily to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He began and to say to them: That today is fulfilled that writing this in to the ears of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all bore testimony to him, and wondered at the words of the graciousness, those proceeding out of the mouth of him, and said: Not this is the son of Joseph?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them: Surely you will say to me the illustration this: Physician, heal thyself; what things we have heard having been done in Capernaum, do thou also here in the country of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said and: Indeed I say to you, that no one a prophet acceptable is in the country of himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In truth but I say to you, many widows were in the days of Elias in the Israel, when was shut up the heaven for years three and months six, so that came a famine great over all the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and to no one of them was sent Elias, if not into Sarepta of the Sidon to a woman a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And many lepers were in of Elisha the prophet in the Israel;

and he was teaching them in the sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonished on the teaching of him; for with authority was the word of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the synagogue was a man having a spirit of a demon unclean, and he cried out with a voice loud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying: Ah, what to us and to thee, Jesus O Nazarene? comest thou to destroy us; I know thee who thou art, the holy of the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And rebuked him the Jesus, saying: Be silent, and come out out of him. And having thrown him the demon into midst, came out of him, nothing hurting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And came amazement on all; and talked to one another, saying: What the word this, for with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And went forth a report concerning him into every place of the country around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Having risen up and out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon; motherinlaw and of the Simon was seized with fever great; and they asked him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And standing above her, he rebuked the fever; and it left her. Forthwith and rising up she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Setting and of the sun, all as many as had being afflicted with disease various, brought them to him; he and one by one separately of them the hands having placed, he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Came out and also demons from many, crying out and saying: That thou art the son of the God. And rebuking not he permitted them to say, that they knew the Anointed him to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Being come and day, coming out he went into a desert place; and the crowds sought him, and came to him, and urged him not to depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He but said to them: That also to the other cities to publish glad tidings me must the kingdom of the God; because for this I have been sent forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he was preaching in the synagogue of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
