To dig not I have strength, to beg I am ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I know what i will do, that, when I may be put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into the house of themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And having summoned one each of the debtors of the lord of himself, he said to the first: How much owest thou to the lord of me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He and said: A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him: Receive of thee the bill, and sitting down quickly write thou fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then to another he said: Thou and how much owest thou? He and said: A hundred cors of wheat. And he says to him: Receive of thee the bill, and write eighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And praised the lord the steward the unjust, because prudently he had done; for the sons of the age this more prudent above the sons of the light for the generation that of themselves are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I to you say: Make you to yourselves friends out of the mammon of the unjust; that, when you may fail, they may receive you into the agelasting tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He faithful in least also in much faithful is; and he in least unjust, and in much unjust is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore in the unrighteous mammon faithful not you have been, the true who to you will entrust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and if in the another faithful not you have been, the yours who to you will give?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one domestic is able two lords to serve; either for the one he will hate, and the other he will love; or one he will cling to, and the other he will slight. Not you are able God to serve and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Heard and these all also the Pharisees, moneylovers being; and they mocked him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them: You are those justifying yourselves in presence of the men; the but God knows the hearts of you; for that by men highly prized, an abomination in presence of the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets till John; from then the kingdom of the God is preached, and every one into her presses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Easier but it is the heaven and the earth to pass away, than of the law one fine point to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one who dismissing the wife of himself, and marrying another, commits adultery; and every one who her being divorced from an husband marrying, commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A man now certain was rich, and was clothed purple and fine linen, feasting every day sumptuously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A poor and certain was named Lazarus, who was laid at the gate of him being covered with sores,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and longing to be fed from the crumbs those falling from the table of the rich; but even the dogs coming licked the sores of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It happened and to die the poor, and to be borne away him by the messengers into the bosom Abraham. Died and also the rich, and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in the unseen having lifted the eyes of himself, being in torment, sees the Abraham from a distance, and Lazarus in the bosoms of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he crying out said: O father Abraham, do thou pity me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of the finger of himself of water, and may cool the tongue of me; for I am in pain in the flame this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Said and Abraham: O child, remember, that thou didst receive the things good of thee in the life of the, and Lazarus in like manner the things bad; now but this is comforted, thou and art in pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And besides all these, between of us and of you a chasm great has been fixed, so that those wishing to pass over hence to you, not is able, nor those thence to us cross over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He said then: I beseech then thee, O father, that thou wouldst send him to the house of the father of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I have for five brothers; that he may testify to them, that not also they may come into the place this of the torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Says to him Abraham: They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He and said: No, O father, Abraham; but if one from dead ones may go to them, they will reform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He said but to him: If Moses and the prophets not they hear, neither if one out of dead one should rise, will they be convinced.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
