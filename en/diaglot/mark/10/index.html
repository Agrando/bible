Are you able to drink the cup, which I drink, and the dipping, which I am dipped, to be dipped?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They and said to him: We are able. The and Jesus said to them: The indeed cup, which I drink, you will drink; and the dipping, which I am dipped, you will be dipped;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>the but to sit at right of me and at left, not is mine to give, but to whom it has been prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And having heard the ten, they began to be angry about James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The but Jesus having called them, he says to them: You know, that those presuming to rule the nations, lord it over them, and the great of them exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Not so but it shall be among you; but whoever may wish to become great among you, shall be of you a servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever may wish of you to become first, shall be of all a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And for the son of the man not came to be served, but to serve, and to give the life of himself a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they come into Jericho; and going out of him from Jericho, and the disciples of him, and a crowd great, a son of Timeus, Bartimeus the blind, sat by the way begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And hearing, that Jesus the Nazarene it is, he began to cry out and to say: The son of David, Jesus, have pity me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And rebuked him many, so that he might be silent; he but much more cried out: O son of David, have pity on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And stopping the Jesus, said him to be called; and they called the blind, saying; to him: Take courage, rise up; he calls thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He and throwing off the mantle of himself, arising came to the Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And answering says to him the Jesus: What dost thou wish I may do to thee? The and blind said to him: Rabboni, that i may see again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The and Jesus said to him: Go; the faith of thee has saved thee. And immediately he saw again, and followed him in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
