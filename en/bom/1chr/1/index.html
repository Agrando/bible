And it came to pass that they did have in this same year a number of battles, in which the Nephites did beat the Lamanites and did slay many of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass that the Lamanites withdrew their design, and there was peace settled in the land; and peace did remain for the space of about four years, that there was no bloodshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land, insomuch that the Lord did take away his beloved disciples, and the work of miracles and of healing did cease because of the iniquity of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not come upon any, because of their wickedness and unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I, *being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a sober mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth was shut, and I was forbidden that I should preach unto them; for behold they had wilfully rebelled against their God; and the beloved disciples were taken away out of the land, because of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But I did remain among them, but I was forbidden to preach unto them, because of the hardness of their hearts; and because of the hardness of their hearts the land was cursed for their sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these Gadianton robbers, who were among the Lamanites, did infest the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof began to hide up their treasures in the earth; and they became slippery, because the Lord had cursed the land, that they could not hold them, nor retain them again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass that there were sorceries, and witchcrafts, and magics; and the power of the evil one was wrought upon all the face of the land, even unto the fulfilling of all the words of Abinadi, and also Samuel the Lamanite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
