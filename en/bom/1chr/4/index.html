And while they were yet weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take possession of the city Desolation, and did slay many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the city Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the seashore; and it was also near the city Desolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it was because the armies of the Nephites went up unto the Lamanites that they began to be smitten; for were it not for that, the Lamanites could have had no power over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake the wicked; and it is by the wicked that the wicked are punished; for it is the wicked that stir up the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did make preparations to come against the city Teancum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass in the three hundred and sixty and fourth year the Lamanites did come against the city Teancum, that they might take possession of the city Teancum also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by the Nephites.
