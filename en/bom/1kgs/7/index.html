And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass in the *thirty and first year that they were divided into tribes, every man according to his family, kindred and friends; nevertheless they had come to an agreement that they would not go to war one with another; but they were not united as to their laws, and their manner of government, for they were established according to the minds of those who were their chiefs and their leaders. But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass that Nephi-having been visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds-went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book. And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in the name of Jesus did he cast out devils and unclean spirits; and even his brother did he raise from the dead, after he had been stoned and suffered death by the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the people saw it, and did witness of it, and were angry with him because of his power; and he did also do many more miracles, in the sight of the people, in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus passed away the *thirty and second year also. And Nephi did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now I would have you to remember also, that there were none who were brought unto repentance who were not baptized with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, there were ordained of Nephi, men unto this ministry, that all such as should come unto them should be baptized with water, and this as a witness and a testimony before God, and unto the people, that they had repented and received a remission of their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there were many in the commencement of this year that were baptized unto repentance; and thus the more part of the year did pass away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
