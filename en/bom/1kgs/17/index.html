Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I perceive that ye desire that I should show unto you what I have done unto your brethren at Jerusalem, for I see that your faith is sufficient that I should heal you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could come for the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass that he commanded that their little children should be brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they brought their little children and set them down upon the ground round about him, and Jesus stood in the midst; and the multitude gave way till they had all been brought unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass that when they had all been brought, and Jesus stood in the midst, he commanded the multitude that they should kneel down upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass that when they had knelt upon the ground, Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record who heard him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And after this manner do they bear record: The eye hath never seen, neither hath the ear heard, before, so great and marvelous things as we saw and heard Jesus speak unto the Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying unto the Father, he arose; but so great was the joy of the multitude that they were overcome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass that Jesus spake unto them, and bade them arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they arose from the earth, and he said unto them: Blessed are ye because of your faith. And now behold, my joy is full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when he had said these words, he wept, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had done this he wept again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he spake unto the multitude, and said unto them: Behold your little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as they looked to behold they cast their eyes towards heaven, and they saw the heavens open, and they saw angels descending out of heaven as it were in the midst of fire; and they came down and encircled those little ones about, and they were encircled about with fire; and the angels did minister unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the multitude did see and hear and bear record; and they know that their record is true for they all of them did see and hear, every man for himself; and they were in number about two thousand and five hundred souls; and they did consist of men, women, and children.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
