I have been called of him to declare his word among his people, that they might have everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it hath become expedient that I, according to the will of God, that the prayers of those who have gone hence, who were the holy ones, should be fulfilled according to their faith, should make a record of these things which have been done-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yea, a small record of that which hath taken place from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem, even down until the present time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore I do make my record from the accounts which have been given by those who were before me, until the commencement of my day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And then I do make a record of the things which I have seen with mine own eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I know the record which I make to be a just and a true record; nevertheless there are many things which, according to our language, we are not able to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now I make an end of my saying, which is of myself, and proceed to give my account of the things which have been before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I am Mormon, and a pure descendant of Lehi. I have reason to bless my God and my Savior Jesus Christ, that he brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, (and no one knew it save it were himself and those whom he brought out of that land) and that he hath given me and my people so much knowledge unto the salvation of our souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Surely he hath blessed the house of Jacob, and hath been merciful unto the seed of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And insomuch as the children of Lehi have kept his commandments he hath blessed them and prospered them according to his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yea, and surely shall he again bring a remnant of the seed of Joseph to the knowledge of the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as surely as the Lord liveth, will he gather in from the four quarters of the earth all the remnant of the seed of Jacob, who are scattered abroad upon all the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he hath covenanted with all the house of Jacob, even so shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house of Jacob be fulfilled in his own due time, unto the restoring all the house of Jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant that he hath covenanted with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then shall they know their Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and then shall they be gathered in from the four quarters of the earth unto their own lands, from whence they have been dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth so shall it be. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
