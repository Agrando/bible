Look unto me, and endure to the end, and ye shall live; for unto him that endureth to the end will I give eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have given unto you the commandments; therefore keep my commandments. And this is the law and the prophets, for they truly testified of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he said unto those twelve whom he had chosen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ye are my disciples; and ye are a light unto this people, who are a remnant of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And behold, this is the land of your inheritance; and the Father hath given it unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And not at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should tell it unto your brethren at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither at any time hath the Father given me commandment that I should tell unto them concerning the other tribes of the house of Israel, whom the Father hath led away out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This much did the Father command me, that I should tell unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now, because of stiffneckedness and unbelief they understood not my word; therefore I was commanded to say no more of the Father concerning this thing unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, verily, I say unto you that the Father hath commanded me, and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among them because of their iniquity; therefore it is because of their iniquity that they know not of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And verily, I say unto you again that the other tribes hath the Father separated from them; and it is because of their iniquity that they know not of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said: Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they understood me not, for they supposed it had been the Gentiles; for they understood not that the Gentiles should be converted through their preaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they understood me not that I said they shall hear my voice; and they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time hear my voice-that I should not manifest myself unto them save it were by the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But behold, ye have both heard my voice, and seen me; and ye are my sheep, and ye are numbered among those whom the Father hath given me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
