And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass that when he said these words, he commanded his Disciples that they should take of the wine of the cup and drink of it, and that they should also give unto the multitude that they might drink of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass that they did so, and did drink of it and were filled; and they gave unto the multitude, and they did drink, and they were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when the Disciples had done this, Jesus said unto them: Blessed are ye for this thing which ye have done, for this is fulfilling my commandments, and this doth witness unto the Father that ye are willing to do that which I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this shall ye always do to those who repent and are baptized in my name; and ye shall do it in remembrance of my blood, which I have shed for you, that ye may witness unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I give unto you a commandment that ye shall do these things. And if ye shall always do these things blessed are ye, for ye are built upon my rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall, and the gates of hell are ready open to receive them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore blessed are ye if ye shall keep my commandments, which the Father hath commanded me that I should give unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as I have prayed among you even so shall ye pray in my church, among my people who do repent and are baptized in my name. Behold I am the light; I have set an example for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words unto his Disciples, he turned again unto the multitude and said unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always lest ye enter into temptation; for Satan desireth to have you, that he may sift you as wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore ye must always pray unto the Father in my name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, ye shall meet together oft; and ye shall not forbid any man from coming unto you when ye shall meet together, but suffer them that they may come unto you and forbid them not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But ye shall pray for them, and shall not cast them out; and if it so be that they come unto you oft ye shall pray for them unto the Father, in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up-that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words, he turned his eyes again upon the Disciples whom he had chosen, and said unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you another commandment, and then I must go unto my Father that I may fulfil other commandments which he hath given me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now behold, this is the commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall not suffer any one knowingly to partake of my flesh and blood unworthily, when ye shall minister it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall forbid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name; and if it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall minister unto him of my flesh and blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if he repent not he shall not be numbered among my people, that he may not destroy my people, for behold I know my sheep, and they are numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, keep these sayings which I have commanded you that ye come not under condemnation; for wo unto him whom the Father condemneth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I give you these commandments because of the disputations which have been among you. And blessed are ye if ye have no disputations among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And now I go unto the Father, because it is expedient that I should go unto the Father for your sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings, he touched with his hand the Disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the multitude heard not the words which he spake, therefore they did not bear record; but the Disciples bare record that he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost. And I will show unto you hereafter that this record is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it came to pass that when Jesus had touched them all, there came a cloud and overshadowed the multitude that they could not see Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And while they were overshadowed he departed from them, and ascended into heaven. And the Disciples saw and did bear record that he ascended again into heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
