And it came to pass that they arose and ministered unto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when they had ministered those same words which Jesus had spoken-nothing varying from the words which Jesus had spoken-behold, they knelt again and prayed to the Father in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they did pray for that which they most desired; and they desired that the Holy Ghost should be given unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they had thus prayed they went down unto the water's edge, and the multitude followed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass that Nephi went down into the water and was baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he came up out of the water and began to baptize. And he baptized all those whom Jesus had chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass when they were all baptized and had come up out of the water, the Holy Ghost did fall upon them, and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And behold, they were encircled about as if it were by fire; and it came down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it, and did bear record; and angels did come down out of heaven and did minister unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass that while the angels were ministering unto the disciples, behold, Jesus came and stood in the midst and ministered unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass that he spake unto the multitude, and commanded them that they should kneel down again upon the earth, and also that his disciples should kneel down upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass that when they had all knelt down upon the earth, he commanded his disciples that they should pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And behold, they began to pray; and they did pray unto Jesus, calling him their Lord and their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass that Jesus departed out of the midst of them, and went a little way off from them and bowed himself to the earth, and he said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Father, I thank thee that thou hast given the Holy Ghost unto these whom I have chosen; and it is because of their belief in me that I have chosen them out of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Father, I pray thee that thou wilt give the Holy Ghost unto all them that shall believe in their words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost because they believe in me; and thou seest that they believe in me because thou hearest them, and they pray unto me; and they pray unto me because I am with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now Father, I pray unto thee for them, and also for all those who shall believe on their words, that they may believe in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father, he came unto his disciples, and behold, they did still continue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and they did not multiply many words, for it was given unto them what they should pray, and they were filled with desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray unto him; and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light of his countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as white as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jesus said unto them: Pray on; nevertheless they did not cease to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he turned from them again, and went a little way off and bowed himself to the earth; and he prayed again unto the Father, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I have chosen, because of their faith, and I pray for them, and also for them who shall believe on their words, that they may be purified in me, through faith on their words, even as they are purified in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Father, I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me out of the world, because of their faith, that they may be purified in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one, that I may be glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Jesus had spoken these words he came again unto his disciples; and behold they did pray steadfastly, without ceasing, unto him; and he did smile upon them again; and behold they were white, even as Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass that he went again a little way off and prayed unto the Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And tongue cannot speak the words which he prayed, neither can be written by man the words which he prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the multitude did hear and do bear record; and their hearts were open and they did understand in their hearts the words which he prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nevertheless, so great and marvelous were the words which he prayed that they cannot be written, neither can they be uttered by man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying he came again to the disciples, and said unto them: So great faith have I never seen among all the Jews; wherefore I could not show unto them so great miracles, because of their unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Verily I say unto you, there are none of them that have seen so great things as ye have seen; neither have they heard so great things as ye have heard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
