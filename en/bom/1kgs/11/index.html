Blessed be the name of the Most High God! And they did fall down at the feet of Jesus, and did worship him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass that he spake unto Nephi (for Nephi was among the multitude) and he commanded him that he should come forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Nephi arose and went forth, and bowed himself before the Lord and did kiss his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Lord commanded him that he should arise. And he arose and stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Lord said unto him: I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize. And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them-Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And now behold, these are the words which ye shall say, calling them by name, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will declare unto you my doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And whoso believeth in me, and is baptized, the same shall be saved; and they are they who shall inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And whoso believeth not in me, and is not baptized, shall be damned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And thus will the Father bear record of me, and the Holy Ghost will bear record unto him of the Father and me; for the Father, and I, and the Holy Ghost are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and become as a little child, and be baptized in my name, or ye can in nowise receive these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And again I say unto you, ye must repent, and be baptized in my name, and become as a little child, or ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and the winds beat upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Therefore, go forth unto this people, and declare the words which I have spoken, unto the ends of the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
