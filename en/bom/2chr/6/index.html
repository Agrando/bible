And when they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land they bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass that they went forth upon the face of the land, and began to till the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jared had four sons; and they were called Jacom, and Gilgah, and Mahah, and Orihah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the brother of Jared also begat sons and daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the friends of Jared and his brother were in number about twenty and two souls; and they also begat sons and daughters before they came to the promised land; and therefore they began to be many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they were taught to walk humbly before the Lord; and they were also taught from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass that they began to spread upon the face of the land, and to multiply and to till the earth; and they did wax strong in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the brother of Jared began to be old, and saw that he must soon go down to the grave; wherefore he said unto Jared: Let us gather together our people that we may number them, that we may know of them what they will desire of us before we go down to our graves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And accordingly the people were gathered together. Now the number of the sons and the daughters of the brother of Jared were twenty and two souls; and the number of sons and daughters of Jared were twelve, he having four sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass that they did number their people; and after that they had numbered them, they did desire of them the things which they would that they should do before they went down to their graves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass that the people desired of them that they should anoint one of their sons to be a king over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now behold, this was grievous unto them. And the brother of Jared said unto them: Surely this thing leadeth into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jared said unto his brother: Suffer them that they may have a king. And therefore he said unto them: Choose ye out from among our sons a king, even whom ye will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the brother of Jared; and his name was Pagag. And it came to pass that he refused and would not be their king. And the people would that his father should constrain him, but his father would not; and he commanded them that they should constrain no man to be their king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came to pass that they chose all the brothers of Pagag, and they would not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass that neither would the sons of Jared, even all save it were one; and Orihah was anointed to be king over the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he began to reign, and the people began to prosper; and they became exceedingly rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass that Jared died, and his brother also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass that Orihah did walk humbly before the Lord, and did remember how great things the Lord had done for his father, and also taught his people how great things the Lord had done for their fathers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
