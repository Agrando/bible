And Coriantumr had taken all the people with him as he fled before Lib in that quarter of the land whither he fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when he had come to the plains of Agosh he gave battle unto Lib, and he smote upon him until he died; nevertheless, the brother of Lib did come against Coriantumr in the stead thereof, and the battle became exceedingly sore, in the which Coriantumr fled again before the army of the brother of Lib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now the name of the brother of Lib was called Shiz. And it came to pass that Shiz pursued after Coriantumr, and he did overthrow many cities, and he did slay both women and children, and he did burn the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there went a fear of Shiz throughout all the land; yea, a cry went forth throughout the land-Who can stand before the army of Shiz? Behold, he sweepeth the earth before him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass that the people began to flock together in armies, throughout all the face of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they were divided; and a part of them fled to the army of Shiz, and a part of them fled to the army of Coriantumr.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And so great and lasting had been the war, and so long had been the scene of bloodshed and carnage, that the whole face of the land was covered with the bodies of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And so swift and speedy was the war that there was none left to bury the dead, but they did march forth from the shedding of blood to the shedding of blood, leaving the bodies of both men, women, and children strewed upon the face of the land, to become a prey to the worms of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land, even upon all the face of the land; wherefore the people became troubled by day and by night, because of the scent thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless, Shiz did not cease to pursue Coriantumr; for he had sworn to avenge himself upon Coriantumr of the blood of his brother, who had been slain, and the word of the Lord which came to Ether that Coriantumr should not fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thus we see that the Lord did visit them in the fulness of his wrath, and their wickedness and abominations had prepared a way for their everlasting destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came to pass that Shiz did pursue Coriantumr eastward, even to the borders by the seashore, and there he gave battle unto Shiz for the space of three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And so terrible was the destruction among the armies of Shiz that the people began to be frightened, and began to flee before the armies of Coriantumr; and they fled to the land of Corihor, and swept off the inhabitants before them, all them that would not join them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they pitched their tents in the valley of Corihor; and Coriantumr pitched his tents in the valley of Shurr. Now the valley of Shurr was near the hill Comnor; wherefore, Coriantumr did gather his armies together upon the hill Comnor, and did sound a trumpet unto the armies of Shiz to invite them forth to battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass that they came forth, but were driven again; and they came the second time, and they were driven again the second time. And it came to pass that they came again the third time, and the battle became exceedingly sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass that Shiz smote upon Coriantumr that he gave him many deep wounds; and Coriantumr, having lost his blood, fainted, and was carried away as though he were dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now the loss of men, women and children on both sides was so great that Shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue the armies of Coriantumr; wherefore, they returned to their camp.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
