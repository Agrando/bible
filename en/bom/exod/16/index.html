Then I said: Here am I; send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said: Go and tell this people-Hear ye indeed, but they understood not; and see ye indeed, but they perceived not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes-lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said I: Lord, how long? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Lord have removed men far away, for there shall be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But yet there shall be a tenth, and they shall return, and shall be eaten, as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
