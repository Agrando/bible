The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Syrians before and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The ancient, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows; for every one of them is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly.
