and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks-nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O house of Jacob, come ye and let us walk in the light of the Lord; yea, come, for ye have all gone astray, every one to his wicked ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, O Lord, thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and hearken unto soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their land is also full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the mean man boweth not down, and the great man humbleth himself not, therefore, forgive him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O ye wicked ones, enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for the fear of the Lord and the glory of his majesty shall smite thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it shall come to pass that the lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the day of the Lord of Hosts soon cometh upon all nations, yea, upon every one; yea, upon the proud and lofty, and upon every one who is lifted up, and he shall be brought low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, and the day of the Lord shall come upon all the cedars of Lebanon, for they are high and lifted up; and upon all the oaks of Bashan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills, and upon all the nations which are lifted up, and upon every people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And upon all the ships of the sea, and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low; and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the idols he shall utterly abolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them and the glory of his majesty shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he hath made for himself to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them and the majesty of his glory shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils;
