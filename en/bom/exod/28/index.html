For the day shall come that the Lord God will speedily visit the inhabitants of the earth; and in that day that they are fully ripe in iniquity they shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But behold, if the inhabitants of the earth shall repent of their wickedness and abominations they shall not be destroyed, saith the Lord of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But behold, that great and abominable church, the whore of all the earth, must tumble to the earth, and great must be the fall thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the kingdom of the devil must shake, and they which belong to it must needs be stirred up unto repentance, or the devil will grasp them with his everlasting chains, and they be stirred up to anger, and perish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For behold, at that day shall he rage in the hearts of the children of men, and stir them up to anger against that which is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And others will he pacify, and lull them away into carnal security, that they will say: All is well in Zion; yea, Zion prospereth, all is well-and thus the devil cheateth their souls, and leadeth them away carefully down to hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none-and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yea, they are grasped with death, and hell; and death, and hell, and the devil, and all that have been seized therewith must stand before the throne of God, and be judged according to their works, from whence they must go into the place prepared for them, even a lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, wo be unto him that is at ease in Zion!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wo be unto him that crieth: All is well!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yea, wo be unto him that hearkeneth unto the precepts of men, and denieth the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yea, wo be unto him that saith: We have received, and we need no more!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And in fine, wo unto all those who tremble, and are angry because of the truth of God! For behold, he that is built upon the rock receiveth it with gladness; and he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Wo be unto him that shall say: We have received the word of God, and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Cursed is he that putteth his trust in man, or maketh flesh his arm, or shall hearken unto the precepts of men, save their precepts shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Wo be unto the Gentiles, saith the Lord God of Hosts! For notwithstanding I shall lengthen out mine arm unto them from day to day, they will deny me; nevertheless, I will be merciful unto them, saith the Lord God, if they will repent and come unto me; for mine arm is lengthened out all the day long, saith the Lord God of Hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
