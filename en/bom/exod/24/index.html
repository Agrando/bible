And the house of Israel shall possess them, and the land of the Lord shall be for servants and handmaids; and they shall take them captives unto whom they were captives; and they shall rule over their oppressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall give thee rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it shall come to pass in that day, that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say: How hath the oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the scepters of the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none hindereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet; they break forth into singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, the fir-trees rejoice at thee, and also the cedars of Lebanon, saying: Since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming; it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All they shall speak and say unto thee: Art thou also become weak as we?
