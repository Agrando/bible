HC 1: 47-48. Joseph Knight believed the declarations of Joseph Smith concerning his possession of the Book of Mormon plates and the work of translation then in progress, and several times had given material assistance to Joseph Smith and his scribe, which enabled them to continue translating. At Joseph Knight's request the Prophet inquired of the Lord and received the revelation.] A GREAT and marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Behold, I am God; give heed to my word, which is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore, give heed unto my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, as you have asked, behold, I say unto you, keep my commandments, and seek to bring forth and establish the cause of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I speak unto you, and also to all those who have desires to bring forth and establish this work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love, having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things, whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, I am the light and the life of the world, that speak these words, therefore give heed with your might, and then you are called.
