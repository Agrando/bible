HC 4: 274-286. Because of increasing persecutions and illegal procedures against them by public officers, the saints had been compelled to leave Missouri. The exterminating order issued by Lilburn W. Boggs, Governor of Missouri, dated October 27, 1838, had left them no alternative. See HC 3: 175. In 1841, when this revelation was given, the city of Nauvoo, occupying the site of the former village of Commerce, Illinois, had been built up by the saints, and here the headquarters of the Church had been established.] VERILY, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, I am well pleased with your offering and acknowledgments, which you have made; for unto this end have I raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Your prayers are acceptable before me; and in answer to them I say unto you, that you are now called immediately to make a solemn proclamation of my gospel, and of this stake which I have planted to be a cornerstone of Zion, which shall be polished with the refinement which is after the similitude of a palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This proclamation shall be made to all the kings of the world, to the four corners thereof, to the honorable president-elect, and the high-minded governors of the nation in which you live, and to all the nations of the earth scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Let it be written in the spirit of meekness and by the power of the Holy Ghost, which shall be in you at the time of the writing of the same;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it shall be given you by the Holy Ghost to know my will concerning those kings and authorities, even what shall befall them in a time to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For, behold, I am about to call upon them to give heed to the light and glory of Zion, for the set time has come to favor her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Call ye, therefore, upon them with loud proclamation, and with your testimony, fearing them not, for they are as grass, and all their glory as the flower thereof which soon falleth, that they may be left also without excuse-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And that I may visit them in the day of visitation, when I shall unveil the face of my covering, to appoint the portion of the oppressor among hypocrites, where there is gnashing of teeth, if they reject my servants and my testimony which I have revealed unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And again, I will visit and soften their hearts, many of them for your good, that ye may find grace in their eyes, that they may come to the light of truth, and the Gentiles to the exaltation or lifting up of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the day of my visitation cometh speedily, in an hour when ye think not of; and where shall be the safety of my people, and refuge for those who shall be left of them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Awake, O kings of the earth! Come ye, O, come ye, with your gold and your silver, to the help of my people, to the house of the daughters of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Robert B. Thompson help you to write this proclamation, for I am well pleased with him, and that he should be with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let him, therefore, hearken to your counsel, and I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings; let him be faithful and true in all things from henceforth, and he shall be great in mine eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But let him remember that his stewardship will I require at his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Again, let my servant John C. Bennett help you in your labor in sending my word to the kings and people of the earth, and stand by you, even you my servant Joseph Smith, in the hour of affliction; and his reward shall not fail if he receive counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And for his love he shall be great, for he shall be mine if he do this, saith the Lord. I have seen the work which he hath done, which I accept if he continue, and will crown him with blessings and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And again, I say unto you that it is my will that my servant Lyman Wight should continue in preaching for Zion, in the spirit of meekness, confessing me before the world; and I will bear him up as on eagles' wings; and he shall beget glory and honor to himself and unto my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>That when he shall finish his work I may receive him unto myself, even as I did my servant David Patten, who is with me at this time, and also my servant Edward Partridge, and also my aged servant Joseph Smith, Sen., who sitteth with Abraham at his right hand, and blessed and holy is he, for he is mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again, verily I say unto you, my servant George Miller is without guile; he may be trusted because of the integrity of his heart; and for the love which he has to my testimony I, the Lord, love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I therefore say unto you, I seal upon his head the office of a bishopric, like unto my servant Edward Partridge, that he may receive the consecrations of mine house, that he may administer blessings upon the heads of the poor of my people, saith the Lord. Let no man despise my servant George, for he shall honor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let my servant George, and my servant Lyman, and my servant John Snider, and others, build a house unto my name, such a one as my servant Joseph shall show unto them, upon the place which he shall show unto them also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall be for a house for boarding, a house that strangers may come from afar to lodge therein; therefore let it be a good house, worthy of all acceptation, that the weary traveler may find health and safety while he shall contemplate the word of the Lord; and the corner-stone I have appointed for Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This house shall be a healthful habitation if it be built unto my name, and if the governor which shall be appointed unto it shall not suffer any pollution to come upon it. It shall be holy, or the Lord your God will not dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And again, verily I say unto you, let all my saints come from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And send ye swift messengers, yea, chosen messengers, and say unto them: Come ye, with all your gold, and your silver, and your precious stones, and with all your antiquities; and with all who have knowledge of antiquities, that will come, may come, and bring the box-tree, and the fir-tree, and the pine-tree, together with all the precious trees of the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And with iron, with copper, and with brass, and with zinc, and with all your precious things of the earth; and build a house to my name, for the Most High to dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For there is not a place found on earth that he may come to and restore again that which was lost unto you, or which he hath taken away, even the fulness of the priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For a baptismal font there is not upon the earth, that they, my saints, may be baptized for those who are dead-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this ordinance belongeth to my house, and cannot be acceptable to me, only in the days of your poverty, wherein ye are not able to build a house unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But I command you, all ye my saints, to build a house unto me; and I grant unto you a sufficient time to build a house unto me; and during this time your baptisms shall be acceptable unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But behold, at the end of this appointment your baptisms for your dead shall not be acceptable unto me; and if you do not these things at the end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a church, with your dead, saith the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For verily I say unto you, that after you have had sufficient time to build a house to me, wherein the ordinance of baptizing for the dead belongeth, and for which the same was instituted from before the foundation of the world, your baptisms for your dead cannot be acceptable unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For therein are the keys of the holy priesthood ordained, that you may receive honor and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And after this time, your baptisms for the dead, by those who are scattered abroad, are not acceptable unto me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For it is ordained that in Zion, and in her stakes, and in Jerusalem, those places which I have appointed for refuge, shall be the places for your baptisms for your dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again, verily I say unto you, how shall your washings be acceptable unto me, except ye perform them in a house which you have built to my name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For, for this cause I commanded Moses that he should build a tabernacle, that they should bear it with them in the wilderness, and to build a house in the land of promise, that those ordinances might be revealed which had been hid from before the world was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, verily I say unto you, that your anointings, and your washings, and your baptisms for the dead, and your solemn assemblies, and your memorials for your sacrifices by the sons of Levi, and for your oracles in your most holy places wherein you receive conversations, and your statutes and judgments, for the beginning of the revelations and foundation of Zion, and for the glory, honor, and endowment of all her municipals, are ordained by the ordinance of my holy house, which my people are always commanded to build unto my holy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And verily I say unto you, let this house be built unto my name, that I may reveal mine ordinances therein unto my people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For I deign to reveal unto my church things which have been kept hid from before the foundation of the world, things that pertain to the dispensation of the fulness of times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I will show unto my servant Joseph all things pertaining to this house, and the priesthood thereof, and the place whereon it shall be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And ye shall build it on the place where you have contemplated building it, for that is the spot which I have chosen for you to build it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>If ye labor with all your might, I will consecrate that spot that it shall be made holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if my people will hearken unto my voice, and unto the voice of my servants whom I have appointed to lead my people, behold, verily I say unto you, they shall not be moved out of their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But if they will not hearken to my voice, nor unto the voice of these men whom I have appointed, they shall not be blest, because they pollute mine holy grounds, and mine holy ordinances, and charters, and my holy words which I give unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And it shall come to pass that if you build a house unto my name, and do not do the things that I say, I will not perform the oath which I make unto you, neither fulfil the promises which ye expect at my hands, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For instead of blessings, ye, by your own works, bring cursings, wrath, indignation, and judgments upon your own heads, by your follies, and by all your abominations, which you practise before me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that when I give a commandment to any of the sons of men to do a work unto my name, and those sons of men go with all their might and with all they have to perform that work, and cease not their diligence, and their enemies come upon them and hinder them from performing that work, behold, it behooveth me to require that work no more at the hands of those sons of men, but to accept of their offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and commandments I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Therefore, for this cause have I accepted the offerings of those whom I commanded to build up a city and a house unto my name, in Jackson county, Missouri, and were hindered by their enemies, saith the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And I will answer judgment, wrath, and indignation, wailing, and anguish, and gnashing of teeth upon their heads, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And this I make an example unto you, for your consolation concerning all those who have been commanded to do a work and have been hindered by the hands of their enemies, and by oppression, saith the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>For I am the Lord your God, and will save all those of your brethren who have been pure in heart, and have been slain in the land of Missouri, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And again, verily I say unto you, I command you again to build a house to my name, even in this place, that you may prove yourselves unto me that ye are faithful in all things whatsoever I command you, that I may bless you, and crown you with honor, immortality, and eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And now I say unto you, as pertaining to my boarding house which I have commanded you to build for the boarding of strangers, let it be built unto my name, and let my name be named upon it, and let my servant Joseph and his house have place therein, from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>For this anointing have I put upon his head, that his blessing shall also be put upon the head of his posterity after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And as I said unto Abraham concerning the kindreds of the earth, even so I say unto my servant Joseph: In thee and in thy seed shall the kindred of the earth be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Therefore, let my servant Joseph and his seed after him have place in that house, from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And let the name of that house be called Nauvoo House; and let it be a delightful habitation for man, and a resting-place for the weary traveler, that he may contemplate the glory of Zion, and the glory of this, the corner-stone thereof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>That he may receive also the counsel from those whom I have set to be as plants of renown, and as watchmen upon her walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Behold, verily I say unto you, let my servant George Miller, and my servant Lyman Wight, and my servant John Snider, and my servant Peter Haws, organize themselves, and appoint one of them to be a president over their quorum for the purpose of building that house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And they shall form a constitution, whereby they may receive stock for the building of that house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And they shall not receive less than fifty dollars for a share of stock in that house, and they shall be permitted to receive fifteen thousand dollars from any one man for stock in that house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>But they shall not be permitted to receive over fifteen thousand dollars stock from any one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And they shall not be permitted to receive under fifty dollars for a share of stock from any one man in that house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And they shall not be permitted to receive any man, as a stockholder in this house, except the same shall pay his stock into their hands at the time he receives stock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And in proportion to the amount of stock he pays into their hands he shall receive stock in that house; but if he pays nothing into their hands he shall not receive any stock in that house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And if any pay stock into their hands it shall be for stock in that house, for himself, and for his generation after him, from generation to generation, so long as he and his heirs shall hold that stock, and do not sell or convey the stock away out of their hands by their own free will and act, if you will do my will, saith the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And again, verily I say unto you, if my servant George Miller, and my servant Lyman Wight, and my servant John Snider, and my servant Peter Haws, receive any stock into their hands, in moneys, or in properties wherein they receive the real value of moneys, they shall not appropriate any portion of that stock to any other purpose, only in that house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And if they do appropriate any portion of that stock anywhere else, only in that house, without the consent of the stockholder, and do not repay fourfold for the stock which they appropriate anywhere else, only in that house, they shall be accursed, and shall be moved out of their place, saith the Lord God; for I, the Lord, am God, and cannot be mocked in any of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Verily I say unto you, let my servant Joseph pay stock into their hands for the building of that house, as seemeth him good; but my servant Joseph cannot pay over fifteen thousand dollars stock in that house, nor under fifty dollars; neither can any other man, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And there are others also who wish to know my will concerning them, for they have asked it at my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Therefore, I say unto you concerning my servant Vinson Knight, if he will do my will let him put stock into that house for himself, and for his generation after him, from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And let him lift up his voice long and loud, in the midst of the people, to plead the cause of the poor and the needy; and let him not fail, neither let his heart faint; and I will accept of his offerings, for they shall not be unto me as the offerings of Cain, for he shall be mine, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>Let his family rejoice and turn away their hearts from affliction; for I have chosen him and anointed him, and he shall be honored in the midst of his house, for I will forgive all his sins, saith the Lord. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>Verily I say unto you, let my servant Hyrum put stock into that house as seemeth him good, for himself and his generation after him, from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Let my servant Isaac Galland put stock into that house; for I, the Lord, love him for the work he hath done, and will forgive all his sins; therefore, let him be remembered for an interest in that house from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>Let my servant Isaac Galland be appointed among you, and be ordained by my servant William Marks, and be blessed of him, to go with my servant Hyrum to accomplish the work that my servant Joseph shall point out to them, and they shall be greatly blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>Let my servant William Marks pay stock into that house, as seemeth him good, for himself and his generation, from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="81">81</a>Let my servant Henry G. Sherwood pay stock into that house, as seemeth him good, for himself and his seed after him, from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="82">82</a>Let my servant William Law pay stock into that house, for himself and his seed after him, from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="83">83</a>If he will do my will let him not take his family unto the eastern lands, even unto Kirtland; nevertheless, I, the Lord, will build up Kirtland, but I, the Lord, have a scourge prepared for the inhabitants thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="84">84</a>And with my servant Almon Babbitt, there are many things with which I am not pleased; behold, he aspireth to establish his counsel instead of the counsel which I have ordained, even that of the Presidency of my Church; and he setteth up a golden calf for the worship of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="85">85</a>Let no man go from this place who has come here essaying to keep my commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="86">86</a>If they live here let them live unto me; and if they die let them die unto me; for they shall rest from all their labors here, and shall continue their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="87">87</a>Therefore, let my servant William put his trust in me, and cease to fear concerning his family, because of the sickness of the land. If ye love me, keep my commandments; and the sickness of the land shall redound to your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="88">88</a>Let my servant William go and proclaim my everlasting gospel with a loud voice, and with great joy, as he shall be moved upon by my Spirit, unto the inhabitants of Warsaw, and also unto the inhabitants of Carthage, and also unto the inhabitants of Burlington, and also unto the inhabitants of Madison, and await patiently and diligently for further instructions at my general conference, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="89">89</a>If he will do my will let him from henceforth hearken to the counsel of my servant Joseph, and with his interest support the cause of the poor, and publish the new translation of my holy word unto the inhabitants of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="90">90</a>And if he will do this I will bless him with a multiplicity of blessings, that he shall not be forsaken, nor his seed be found begging bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="91">91</a>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant William be appointed, ordained, and anointed, as counselor unto my servant Joseph, in the room of my servant Hyrum, that my servant Hyrum may take the office of Priesthood and Patriarch, which was appointed unto him by his father, by blessing and also by right;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="92">92</a>That from henceforth he shall hold the keys of the patriarchal blessings upon the heads of all my people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="93">93</a>That whoever he blesses shall be blessed, and whoever he curses shall be cursed; that whatsoever he shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever he shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="94">94</a>And from this time forth I appoint unto him that he may be a prophet, and a seer, and a revelator unto my church, as well as my servant Joseph;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="95">95</a>That he may act in concert also with my servant Joseph; and that he shall receive counsel from my servant Joseph, who shall show unto him the keys whereby he may ask and receive, and be crowned with the same blessing, and glory, and honor, and priesthood, and gifts of the priesthood, that once were put upon him that was my servant Oliver Cowdery;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="96">96</a>That my servant Hyrum may bear record of the things which I shall show unto him, that his name may be had in honorable remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="97">97</a>Let my servant William Law also receive the keys by which he may ask and receive blessings; let him be humble before me, and be without guile, and he shall receive of my Spirit, even the Comforter, which shall manifest unto him the truth of all things, and shall give him, in the very hour, what he shall say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="98">98</a>And these signs shall follow him-he shall heal the sick, he shall cast out devils, and shall be delivered from those who would administer unto him deadly poison;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="99">99</a>And he shall be led in paths where the poisonous serpent cannot lay hold upon his heel, and he shall mount up in the imagination of his thoughts as upon eagles' wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="100">100</a>And what if I will that he should raise the dead, let him not withhold his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="101">101</a>Therefore, let my servant William cry aloud and spare not, with joy and rejoicing, and with hosannas to him that sitteth upon the throne forever and ever, saith the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="102">102</a>Behold, I say unto you, I have a mission in store for my servant William, and my servant Hyrum, and for them alone; and let my servant Joseph tarry at home, for he is needed. The remainder I will show unto you hereafter. Even so. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="103">103</a>And again, verily I say unto you, if my servant Sidney will serve me and be counselor unto my servant Joseph, let him arise and come up and stand in the office of his calling, and humble himself before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="104">104</a>And if he will offer unto me an acceptable offering, and acknowledgments, and remain with my people, behold, I, the Lord your God, will heal him that he shall be healed; and he shall lift up his voice again on the mountains, and be a spokesman before my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="105">105</a>Let him come and locate his family in the neighborhood in which my servant Joseph resides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="106">106</a>And in all his journeyings let him lift up his voice as with the sound of a trump, and warn the inhabitants of the earth to flee the wrath to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="107">107</a>Let him assist my servant Joseph, and also let my servant William Law assist my servant Joseph, in making a solemn proclamation unto the kings of the earth, even as I have before said unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="108">108</a>If my servant Sidney will do my will, let him not remove his family unto the eastern lands, but let him change their habitation, even as I have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="109">109</a>Behold, it is not my will that he shall seek to find safety and refuge out of the city which I have appointed unto you, even the city of Nauvoo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="110">110</a>Verily I say unto you, even now, if he will hearken unto my voice, it shall be well with him. Even so. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="111">111</a>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Amos Davies pay stock into the hands of those whom I have appointed to build a house for boarding, even the Nauvoo House.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="112">112</a>This let him do if he will have an interest; and let him hearken unto the counsel of my servant Joseph, and labor with his own hands that he may obtain the confidence of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="113">113</a>And when he shall prove himself faithful in all things that shall be entrusted unto his care, yea, even a few things, he shall be made ruler over many;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="114">114</a>Let him therefore abase himself that he may be exalted. Even so. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="115">115</a>And again, verily I say unto you, if my servant Robert D.
