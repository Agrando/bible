He had already served as a secretary to the Prophet in recording many of the revelations received in the Fayette, New York, area.] BEHOLD, it is expedient in me that my servant John should write and keep a regular history, and assist you, my servant Joseph, in transcribing all things which shall be given you, until he is called to further duties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Again, verily I say unto you that he can also lift up his voice in meetings, whenever it shall be expedient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And again, I say unto you that it shall be appointed unto him to keep the church record and history continually; for Oliver Cowdery I have appointed to another office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Wherefore, it shall be given him, inasmuch as he is faithful, by the Comforter, to write these things.
