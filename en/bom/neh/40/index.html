HC 1: 145. Preceding the record of this revelation, the Prophet wrote: "As James Covill rejected the word of the Lord, and returned to his former principles and people, the Lord gave unto me and Sidney Rigdon the following revelation."] BEHOLD, verily I say unto you, that the heart of my servant James Covill was right before me, for he covenanted with me that he would obey my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he received the word with gladness, but straightway Satan tempted him; and the fear of persecution and the cares of the world caused him to reject the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wherefore he broke my covenant, and it remaineth with me to do with him as seemeth me good.
