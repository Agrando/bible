HC 1: 111-115. This revelation was given some days prior to the conference beginning September 26, 1830.] LISTEN to the voice of Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, the Great I AM, whose arm of mercy hath atoned for your sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who will gather his people even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, even as many as will hearken to my voice and humble themselves before me, and call upon me in mighty prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that at this time your sins are forgiven you, therefore ye receive these things; but remember to sin no more, lest perils shall come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Verily, I say unto you that ye are chosen out of the world to declare my gospel with the sound of rejoicing, as with the voice of a trump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Lift up your hearts and be glad, for I am in your midst, and am your advocate with the Father; and it is his good will to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, as it is written-Whatsoever ye shall ask in faith, being united in prayer according to my command, ye shall receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Wherefore the decree hath gone forth from the Father that they shall be gathered in unto one place upon the face of this land, to prepare their hearts and be prepared in all things against the day when tribulation and desolation are sent forth upon the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the hour is nigh and the day soon at hand when the earth is ripe; and all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that wickedness shall not be upon the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the hour is nigh, and that which was spoken by mine apostles must be fulfilled; for as they spoke so shall it come to pass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I will reveal myself from heaven with power and great glory, with all the hosts thereof, and dwell in righteousness with men on earth a thousand years, and the wicked shall not stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, and it hath gone forth in a firm decree, by the will of the Father, that mine apostles, the Twelve which were with me in my ministry at Jerusalem, shall stand at my right hand at the day of my coming in a pillar of fire, being clothed with robes of righteousness, with crowns upon their heads, in glory even as I am, to judge the whole house of Israel, even as many as have loved me and kept my commandments, and none else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For a trump shall sound both long and loud, even as upon Mount Sinai, and all the earth shall quake, and they shall come forth-yea, even the dead which died in me, to receive a crown of righteousness, and to be clothed upon, even as I am, to be with me, that we may be one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, behold, I say unto you that before this great day shall come the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall be turned into blood, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and there shall be greater signs in heaven above and in the earth beneath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there shall be weeping and wailing among the hosts of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there shall be a great hailstorm sent forth to destroy the crops of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall come to pass, because of the wickedness of the world, that I will take vengeance upon the wicked, for they will not repent; for the cup of mine indignation is full; for behold, my blood shall not cleanse them if they hear me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wherefore, I the Lord God will send forth flies upon the face of the earth, which shall take hold of the inhabitants thereof, and shall eat their flesh, and shall cause maggots to come in upon them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And their tongues shall be stayed that they shall not utter against me; and their flesh shall fall from off their bones, and their eyes from their sockets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it shall come to pass that the beasts of the forest and the fowls of the air shall devour them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall be cast down by devouring fire, according as it is spoken by the mouth of Ezekiel the prophet, who spoke of these things, which have not come to pass but surely must, as I live, for abominations shall not reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And again, verily, verily, I say unto you that when the thousand years are ended, and men again begin to deny their God, then will I spare the earth but for a little season;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the end shall come, and the heaven and the earth shall be consumed and pass away, and there shall be a new heaven and a new earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For all old things shall pass away, and all things shall become new, even the heaven and the earth, and all the fulness thereof, both men and beasts, the fowls of the air, and the fishes of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And not one hair, neither mote, shall be lost, for it is the workmanship of mine hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, behold, verily I say unto you, before the earth shall pass away, Michael, mine archangel, shall sound his trump, and then shall all the dead awake, for their graves shall be opened, and they shall come forth-yea, even all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the righteous shall be gathered on my right hand unto eternal life; and the wicked on my left hand will I be ashamed to own before the Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherefore I will say unto them-Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, behold, I say unto you, never at any time have I declared from mine own mouth that they should return, for where I am they cannot come, for they have no power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But remember that all my judgments are not given unto men; and as the words have gone forth out of my mouth even so shall they be fulfilled, that the first shall be last, and that the last shall be first in all things whatsoever I have created by the word of my power, which is the power of my Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For by the power of my Spirit created I them; yea, all things both spiritual and temporal-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>First spiritual, secondly temporal, which is the beginning of my work; and again, first temporal, and secondly spiritual, which is the last of my work-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Speaking unto you that you may naturally understand; but unto myself my works have no end, neither beginning; but it is given unto you that ye may understand, because ye have asked it of me and are agreed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass that Adam, being tempted of the devil-for, behold, the devil was before Adam, for he rebelled against me, saying, Give me thine honor, which is my power; and also a third part of the hosts of heaven turned he away from me because of their agency;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they were thrust down, and thus came the devil and his angels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And, behold, there is a place prepared for them from the beginning, which place is hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Wherefore, it came to pass that the devil tempted Adam, and he partook of the forbidden fruit and transgressed the commandment, wherein he became subject to the will of the devil, because he yielded unto temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be cast out from the Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But, behold, I say unto you that I, the Lord God, gave unto Adam and unto his seed, that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I, the Lord God, should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and redemption, through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And thus did I, the Lord God, appoint unto man the days of his probation-that by his natural death he might be raised in immortality unto eternal life, even as many as would believe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they that believe not unto eternal damnation; for they cannot be redeemed from their spiritual fall, because they repent not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For they love darkness rather than light, and their deeds are evil, and they receive their wages of whom they list to obey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But behold, I say unto you, that little children are redeemed from the foundation of the world through mine Only Begotten;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Wherefore, they cannot sin, for power is not given unto Satan to tempt little children, until they begin to become accountable before me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For it is given unto them even as I will, according to mine own pleasure, that great things may be required at the hand of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And, again, I say unto you, that whoso having knowledge, have I not commanded to repent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he that hath no understanding, it remaineth in me to do according as it is written. And now I declare no more unto you at this time. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
