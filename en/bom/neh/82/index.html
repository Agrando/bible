HC 1: 267-269. The occasion was a general council of the Church at which Joseph Smith the Prophet was sustained as the President of the High Priesthood, to which office he had previously been ordained at a conference of high priests, elders, and members, at Amherst, Ohio, January 25, 1832 (see heading to Section 75). Formerly unusual names were used in the publication of this revelation to conceal the identity of the persons named (see heading to Section 78). These unusual names have now been dropped, except in cases where the identification is not known (see verse 11).] VERILY, verily, I say unto you, my servants, that inasmuch as you have forgiven one another your trespasses, even so I, the Lord, forgive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Nevertheless, there are those among you who have sinned exceedingly; yea, even all of you have sinned; but verily I say unto you, beware from henceforth, and refrain from sin, lest sore judgments fall upon your heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For of him unto whom much is given much is required; and he who sins against the greater light shall receive the greater condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Ye call upon my name for revelations, and I give them unto you; and inasmuch as ye keep not my sayings, which I give unto you, ye become transgressors; and justice and judgment are the penalty which is affixed unto my law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, what I say unto one I say unto all: Watch, for the adversary spreadeth his dominions, and darkness reigneth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the anger of God kindleth against the inhabitants of the earth; and none doeth good, for all have gone out of the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now, verily I say unto you, I, the Lord, will not lay any sin to your charge; go your ways and sin no more; but unto that soul who sinneth shall the former sins return, saith the Lord your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a new commandment, that you may understand my will concerning you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or, in other words, I give unto you directions how you may act before me, that it may turn to you for your salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I, the Lord, am bound when ye do what I say; but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, verily I say unto you, that it is expedient for my servants Edward Partridge and Newel K. Whitney, A. Sidney Gilbert and Sidney Rigdon, and my servant Joseph Smith, and John Whitmer and Oliver Cowdery, and W. W. Phelps and Martin Harris to be bound together by a bond and covenant that cannot be broken by transgression, except judgment shall immediately follow, in your several stewardships-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To manage the affairs of the poor, and all things pertaining to the bishopric both in the land of Zion and in the land of Kirtland;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have consecrated the land of Kirtland in mine own due time for the benefit of the saints of the Most High, and for a stake to Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For Zion must increase in beauty, and in holiness; her borders must be enlarged; her stakes must be strengthened; yea, verily I say unto you, Zion must arise and put on her beautiful garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, I give unto you this commandment, that ye bind yourselves by this covenant, and it shall be done according to the laws of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, here is wisdom also in me for your good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you are to be equal, or in other words, you are to have equal claims on the properties, for the benefit of managing the concerns of your stewardships, every man according to his wants and his needs, inasmuch as his wants are just-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord's storehouse, to become the common property of the whole church-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This order I have appointed to be an everlasting order unto you, and unto your successors, inasmuch as you sin not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the soul that sins against this covenant, and hardeneth his heart against it, shall be dealt with according to the laws of my church, and shall be delivered over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, verily I say unto you, and this is wisdom, make unto yourselves friends with the mammon of unrighteousness, and they will not destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Leave judgment alone with me, for it is mine and I will repay. Peace be with you; my blessings continue with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For even yet the kingdom is yours, and shall be forever, if you fall not from your steadfastness. Even so. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
