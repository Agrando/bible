HC 1: 403-406. This revelation came in consequence of the persecution upon the saints in Missouri. It is natural that the saints in Missouri, having suffered physically and also having lost property, should feel an inclination toward retaliation and revenge. Therefore the Lord gave this revelation. Although some news of the problems in Missouri had no doubt reached the Prophet in Kirtland (nine hundred miles away), the seriousness of the situation could have been known to him at this date only by revelation.] VERILY I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Waiting patiently on the Lord, for your prayers have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded with this seal and testament-the Lord hath sworn and decreed that they shall be granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore, he giveth this promise unto you, with an immutable covenant that they shall be fulfilled; and all things wherewith you have been afflicted shall work together for your good, and to my name's glory, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And now, verily I say unto you concerning the laws of the land, it is my will that my people should observe to do all things whatsoever I command them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as pertaining to law of man, whatsoever is more or less than this, cometh of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I, the Lord God, make you free, therefore ye are free indeed; and the law also maketh you free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; otherwise whatsoever is less than these cometh of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I give unto you a commandment, that ye shall forsake all evil and cleave unto all good, that ye shall live by every word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For he will give unto the faithful line upon line, precept upon precept; and I will try you and prove you herewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name's sake, shall find it again, even life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, be not afraid of your enemies, for I have decreed in my heart, saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant, even unto death, that you may be found worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if ye will not abide in my covenant ye are not worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, renounce war and proclaim peace, and seek diligently to turn the hearts of the children to their fathers, and the hearts of the fathers to the children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And again, the hearts of the Jews unto the prophets, and the prophets unto the Jews; lest I come and smite the whole earth with a curse, and all flesh be consumed before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let not your hearts be troubled; for in my Father's house are many mansions, and I have prepared a place for you; and where my Father and I am, there ye shall be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with many who are in the church at Kirtland;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they do not forsake their sins, and their wicked ways, the pride of their hearts, and their covetousness, and all their detestable things, and observe the words of wisdom and eternal life which I have given unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Verily I say unto you, that I, the Lord, will chasten them and will do whatsoever I list, if they do not repent and observe all things whatsoever I have said unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And again I say unto you, if ye observe to do whatsoever I command you, I, the Lord, will turn away all wrath and indignation from you, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, I speak unto you concerning your families-if men will smite you, or your families, once, and ye bear it patiently and revile not against them, neither seek revenge, ye shall be rewarded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if ye bear it not patiently, it shall be accounted unto you as being meted out as a just measure unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And again, if your enemy shall smite you the second time, and you revile not against your enemy, and bear it patiently, your reward shall be an hundredfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And again, if he shall smite you the third time, and ye bear it patiently, your reward shall be doubled unto you four-fold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And these three testimonies shall stand against your enemy if he repent not, and shall not be blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, verily I say unto you, if that enemy shall escape my vengeance, that he be not brought into judgment before me, then ye shall see to it that ye warn him in my name, that he come no more upon you, neither upon your family, even your children's children unto the third and fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And then, if he shall come upon you or your children, or your children's children unto the third and fourth generation, I have delivered thine enemy into thine hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then if thou wilt spare him, thou shalt be rewarded for thy righteousness; and also thy children and thy children's children unto the third and fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Nevertheless, thine enemy is in thine hands; and if thou rewardest him according to his works thou art justified; if he has sought thy life, and thy life is endangered by him, thine enemy is in thine hands and thou art justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, this is the law I gave unto my servant Nephi, and thy fathers, Joseph, and Jacob, and Isaac, and Abraham, and all mine ancient prophets and apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And again, this is the law that I gave unto mine ancients, that they should not go out unto battle against any nation, kindred, tongue, or people, save I, the Lord, commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if any nation, tongue, or people should proclaim war against them, they should first lift a standard of peace unto that people, nation, or tongue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if that people did not accept the offering of peace, neither the second nor the third time, they should bring these testimonies before the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then I, the Lord, would give unto them a commandment, and justify them in going out to battle against that nation, tongue, or people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I, the Lord, would fight their battles, and their children's battles, and their children's children's, until they had avenged themselves on all their enemies, to the third and fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, this is an ensample unto all people, saith the Lord your God, for justification before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And again, verily I say unto you, if after thine enemy has come upon thee the first time, he repent and come unto thee praying thy forgiveness, thou shalt forgive him, and shalt hold it no more as a testimony against thine enemy-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And so on unto the second and third time; and as oft as thine enemy repenteth of the trespass wherewith he has trespassed against thee, thou shalt forgive him, until seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if he trespass against thee and repent not the first time, nevertheless thou shalt forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And if he trespass against thee the second time, and repent not, nevertheless thou shalt forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if he trespass against thee the third time, and repent not, thou shalt also forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But if he trespass against thee the fourth time thou shalt not forgive him, but shalt bring these testimonies before the Lord; and they shall not be blotted out until he repent and reward thee four-fold in all things wherewith he has trespassed against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if he do this, thou shalt forgive him with all thine heart; and if he do not this, I, the Lord, will avenge thee of thine enemy an hundred-fold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And upon his children, and upon his children's children of all them that hate me, unto the third and fourth generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if the children shall repent, or the children's children, and turn to the Lord their God, with all their hearts and with all their might, mind, and strength, and restore four-fold for all their trespasses wherewith they have trespassed, or wherewith their fathers have trespassed, or their fathers' fathers, then thine indignation shall be turned away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And vengeance shall no more come upon them, saith the Lord thy God, and their trespasses shall never be brought any more as a testimony before the Lord against them. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
