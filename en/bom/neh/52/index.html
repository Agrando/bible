HC 1: 175-179. A conference had been held at Kirtland, beginning on the 3rd, and closing on the 6th of June. At this conference the first distinctive ordinations to the office of high priest were made, and certain manifestations of false and deceiving spirits were discerned and rebuked.] BEHOLD, thus saith the Lord unto the elders whom he hath called and chosen in these last days, by the voice of his Spirit-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Saying: I, the Lord, will make known unto you what I will that ye shall do from this time until the next conference, which shall be held in Missouri, upon the land which I will consecrate unto my people, which are a remnant of Jacob, and those who are heirs according to the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wherefore, verily I say unto you, let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Sidney Rigdon take their journey as soon as preparations can be made to leave their homes, and journey to the land of Missouri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And inasmuch as they are faithful unto me, it shall be made known unto them what they shall do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it shall also, inasmuch as they are faithful, be made known unto them the land of your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And inasmuch as they are not faithful, they shall be cut off, even as I will, as seemeth me good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Lyman Wight and my servant John Corrill take their journey speedily;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And also my servant John Murdock, and my servant Hyrum Smith, take their journey unto the same place by the way of Detroit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And let them journey from thence preaching the word by the way, saying none other things than that which the prophets and apostles have written, and that which is taught them by the Comforter through the prayer of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let them go two by two, and thus let them preach by the way in every congregation, baptizing by water, and the laying on of the hands by the water's side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For thus saith the Lord, I will cut my work short in righteousness, for the days come that I will send forth judgment unto victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And let my servant Lyman Wight beware, for Satan desireth to sift him as chaff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And behold, he that is faithful shall be made ruler over many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And again, I will give unto you a pattern in all things, that ye may not be deceived; for Satan is abroad in the land, and he goeth forth deceiving the nations-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Wherefore he that prayeth, whose spirit is contrite, the same is accepted of me if he obey mine ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that speaketh, whose spirit is contrite, whose language is meek and edifieth, the same is of God if he obey mine ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And again, he that trembleth under my power shall be made strong, and shall bring forth fruits of praise and wisdom, according to the revelations and truths which I have given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And again, he that is overcome and bringeth not forth fruits, even according to this pattern, is not of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore, by this pattern ye shall know the spirits in all cases under the whole heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the days have come; according to men's faith it shall be done unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, this commandment is given unto all the elders whom I have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Thomas B.
