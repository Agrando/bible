See Section 88: 119-136 and Section 94.] VERILY, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, and I have loved you-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Wherefore, ye must needs be chastened and stand rebuked before my face;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For ye have sinned against me a very grievous sin, in that ye have not considered the great commandment in all things, that I have given unto you concerning the building of mine house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the preparation wherewith I design to prepare mine apostles to prune my vineyard for the last time, that I may bring to pass my strange act, that I may pour out my Spirit upon all flesh-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But behold, verily I say unto you, that there are many who have been ordained among you, whom I have called but few of them are chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They who are not chosen have sinned a very grievous sin, in that they are walking in darkness at noon-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And for this cause I gave unto you a commandment that you should call your solemn assembly, that your fastings and your mourning might come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, which is by interpretation, the creator of the first day, the beginning and the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, verily I say unto you, I gave unto you a commandment that you should build a house, in the which house I design to endow those whom I have chosen with power from on high;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this is the promise of the Father unto you; therefore I command you to tarry, even as mine apostles at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nevertheless, my servants sinned a very grievous sin; and contentions arose in the school of the prophets; which was very grievous unto me, saith your Lord; therefore I sent them forth to be chastened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Verily I say unto you, it is my will that you should build a house.
