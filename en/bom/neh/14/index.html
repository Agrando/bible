HC 1: 48-50. The Whitmer family had become greatly interested in the translating of the Book of Mormon. The Prophet established his residence at the home of Peter Whitmer, Sen., where he dwelt until the work of translation was carried to completion and the copyright on the forthcoming book secured. Three of the Whitmer sons, each having received a testimony as to the genuineness of the work, became deeply concerned over the matter of their individual duty. This revelation and the two next following (Sections 15 and 16) were given in answer to an inquiry through the Urim and Thummim. David Whitmer later became one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon.] A GREAT and marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Behold, I am God; give heed to my word, which is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of both joints and marrow; therefore give heed unto my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yea, whosoever will thrust in his sickle and reap, the same is called of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, if you will ask of me you shall receive; if you will knock it shall be opened unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Seek to bring forth and establish my Zion.
