HC 1: 115-116. Originally this material was published as three revelations; it was combined into one section by the Prophet for the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants.] BEHOLD, I say unto you, David, that you have feared man and have not relied on me for strength as you ought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But your mind has been on the things of the earth more than on the things of me, your Maker, and the ministry whereunto you have been called; and you have not given heed unto my Spirit, and to those who were set over you, but have been persuaded by those whom I have not commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wherefore, you are left to inquire for yourself at my hand, and ponder upon the things which you have received.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And your home shall be at your father's house, until I give unto you further commandments. And you shall attend to the ministry in the church, and before the world, and in the regions round about. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I say unto you, Peter, that you shall take your journey with your brother Oliver; for the time has come that it is expedient in me that you shall open your mouth to declare my gospel; therefore, fear not, but give heed unto the words and advice of your brother, which he shall give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And be you afflicted in all his afflictions, ever lifting up your heart unto me in prayer and faith, for his and your deliverance; for I have given unto him power to build up my church among the Lamanites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And none have I appointed to be his counselor over him in the church, concerning church matters, except it is his brother, Joseph Smith, Jun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Wherefore, give heed unto these things and be diligent in keeping my commandments, and you shall be blessed unto eternal life. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, I say unto you, my servant John, that thou shalt commence from this time forth to proclaim my gospel, as with the voice of a trump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And your labor shall be at your brother Philip Burroughs', and in that region round about, yea, wherever you can be heard, until I command you to go from hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And your whole labor shall be in Zion, with all your soul, from henceforth; yea, you shall ever open your mouth in my cause, not fearing what man can do, for I am with you. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
