Marsh, September 1830. HC 1: 115-117. The occasion was immediately following a conference of the Church. See heading to Section 30. Thomas B. Marsh had been baptized earlier in the month, and had been ordained an elder in the Church before this revelation was given.] THOMAS, my son, blessed are you because of your faith in my work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Behold, you have had many afflictions because of your family; nevertheless, I will bless you and your family, yea, your little ones; and the day cometh that they will believe and know the truth and be one with you in my church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lift up your heart and rejoice, for the hour of your mission is come; and your tongue shall be loosed, and you shall declare glad tidings of great joy unto this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You shall declare the things which have been revealed to my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun. You shall begin to preach from this time forth, yea, to reap in the field which is white already to be burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, thrust in your sickle with all your soul, and your sins are forgiven you, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your back, for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Wherefore, your family shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, verily I say unto you, go from them only for a little time, and declare my word, and I will prepare a place for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yea, I will open the hearts of the people, and they will receive you. And I will establish a church by your hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you shall strengthen them and prepare them against the time when they shall be gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be patient in afflictions, revile not against those that revile. Govern your house in meekness, and be steadfast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I say unto you that you shall be a physician unto the church, but not unto the world, for they will not receive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go your way whithersoever I will, and it shall be given you by the Comforter what you shall do and whither you shall go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Pray always, lest you enter into temptation and lose your reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be faithful unto the end, and lo, I am with you. These words are not of man nor of men, but of me, even Jesus Christ, your Redeemer, by the will of the Father. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
