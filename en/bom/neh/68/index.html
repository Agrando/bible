Johnson, Lyman E. Johnson, and William E. McLellin. HC 1: 227-229. Although this revelation was given in response to supplication that the mind of the Lord be made known concerning the elders named, much of the content pertains to the whole Church.] MY servant, Orson Hyde, was called by his ordination to proclaim the everlasting gospel, by the Spirit of the living God, from people to people, and from land to land, in the congregations of the wicked, in their synagogues, reasoning with and expounding all scriptures unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And, behold, and lo, this is an ensample unto all those who were ordained unto this priesthood, whose mission is appointed unto them to go forth-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this is the ensample unto them, that they shall speak as they are moved upon by the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And whatsoever they shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, this is the promise of the Lord unto you, O ye my servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>This is the word of the Lord unto you, my servant Orson Hyde, and also unto my servant Luke Johnson, and unto my servant Lyman Johnson, and unto my servant William E. McLellin, and unto all the faithful elders of my church-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go ye into all the world, preach the gospel to every creature, acting in the authority which I have given you, baptizing in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, and he that believeth not shall be damned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he that believeth shall be blest with signs following, even as it is written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And unto you it shall be given to know the signs of the times, and the signs of the coming of the Son of Man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And of as many as the Father shall bear record, to you shall be given power to seal them up unto eternal life.
