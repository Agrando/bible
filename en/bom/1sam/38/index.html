But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and temperate in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>See that ye are not lifted up unto pride; yea, see that ye do not boast in your own wisdom, nor of your much strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Use boldness, but not overbearance; and also see that ye bridle all your passions, that ye may be filled with love; see that ye refrain from idleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not pray as the Zoramites do, for ye have seen that they pray to be heard of men, and to be praised for their wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy-yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And may the Lord bless your soul, and receive you at the last day into his kingdom, to sit down in peace. Now go, my son, and teach the word unto this people. Be sober. My son, farewell.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
