Behold, we have escaped from the Nephites, and they sleep; and behold we have taken of their wine and brought with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him with joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink; we are glad that ye have thus taken wine with you for we are weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go against the Nephites to battle. But this saying only made them more desirous to drink of the wine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the wine, and by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which will strengthen us to go against the Nephites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it was pleasant to their taste, therefore they took of it more freely; and it was strong, having been prepared in its strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by they were all drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken, and were in a deep sleep, they returned to Moroni and told him all the things that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now this was according to the design of Moroni. And Moroni had prepared his men with weapons of war; and he went to the city Gid, while the Lamanites were in a deep sleep and drunken, and cast in weapons of war unto the prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as many as were able to use a weapon of war, when Moroni had armed all those prisoners; and all those things were done in a profound silence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunken and the Nephites could have slain them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not delight in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those prisoners of the Nephites who were within the wall of the city, and had given them power to gain possession of those parts which were within the walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the Lamanites awoke in the morning they beheld that they were surrounded by the Nephites without, and that their prisoners were armed within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they should fight with the Nephites; therefore their chief captains demanded their weapons of war, and they brought them forth and cast them at the feet of the Nephites, pleading for mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni. He took them prisoners of war, and took possession of the city, and caused that all the prisoners should be liberated, who were Nephites; and they did join the army of Moroni, and were a great strength to his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he had taken prisoners, that they should commence a labor in strengthening the fortifications round about the city Gid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid, according to his desires, he caused that his prisoners should be taken to the city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with an exceedingly strong force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the intrigues of the Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners whom they had taken, and also maintain all the ground and the advantage which they had retaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass that the Nephites began again to be victorious, and to reclaim their rights and their privileges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Many times did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by night, but in these attempts they did lose many prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And many times did they attempt to administer of their wine to the Nephites, that they might destroy them with poison or with drunkenness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But behold, the Nephites were not slow to remember the Lord their God in this their time of affliction. They could not be taken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine, save they had first given to some of the Lamanite prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were thus cautious that no poison should be administered among them; for if their wine would poison a Lamanite it would also poison a Nephite; and thus they did try all their liquors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make preparations to attack the city Morianton; for behold, the Lamanites had, by their labors, fortified the city Morianton until it had become an exceeding stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they were continually bringing new forces into that city, and also new supplies of provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And thus ended the twenty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
