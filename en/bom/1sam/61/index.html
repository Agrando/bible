And these are the words which he received:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army. Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea, insomuch that they have risen up in rebellion against me, and also those of my people who are freemen, yea, and those who have risen up are exceedingly numerous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great flattery, and they have led away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our freemen that they have not come unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold, they have driven me out before them, and I have fled to the land of Gideon, with as many men as it were possible that I could get.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And behold, I have sent a proclamation throughout this part of the land; and behold, they are flocking to us daily, to their arms, in the defence of their country and their freedom, and to avenge our wrongs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they have come unto us, insomuch that those who have risen up in rebellion against us are set at defiance, yea, insomuch that they do fear us and durst not come out against us to battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They have got possession of the land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they have appointed a king over them, and he hath written unto the king of the Lamanites, in the which he hath joined an alliance with him; in the which alliance he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla, which maintenance he supposeth will enable the Lamanites to conquer the remainder of the land, and he shall be placed king over this people when they shall be conquered under the Lamanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I, Pahoran, do not seek for power, save only to retain my judgment-seat that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people. My soul standeth fast in that liberty in the which God hath made us free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now, behold, we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed. We would not shed the blood of the Lamanites if they would stay in their own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not rise up in rebellion and take the sword against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We would subject ourselves to the yoke of bondage if it were requisite with the justice of God, or if he should command us so to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But behold he doth not command us that we shall subject ourselves to our enemies, but that we should put our trust in him, and he will deliver us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, my beloved brother, Moroni, let us resist evil, and whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words, yea, such as rebellions and dissensions, let us resist them with our swords, that we may retain our freedom, that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church, and in the cause of our Redeemer and our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, come unto me speedily with a few of your men, and leave the remainder in the charge of Lehi and Teancum; give unto them power to conduct the war in that part of the land, according to the Spirit of God, which is also the spirit of freedom which is in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold I have sent a few provisions unto them, that they may not perish until ye can come unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather together whatsoever force ye can upon your march hither, and we will go speedily against those dissenters, in the strength of our God according to the faith which is in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we will take possession of the city of Zarahemla, that we may obtain more food to send forth unto Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go forth against them in the strength of the Lord, and we will put an end to this great iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now, Moroni, I do joy in receiving your epistle, for I was somewhat worried concerning what we should do, whether it should be just in us to go against our brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But ye have said, except they repent the Lord hath commanded you that ye should go against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell them to fear not, for God will deliver them, yea, and also all those who stand fast in that liberty wherewith God hath made them free. And now I close mine epistle to my beloved brother, Moroni.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
