I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of the judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned towards my house. And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house-and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of the things which were to come, according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they might find witness against them, that they might deliver them to their judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear or witness against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were lawyers, who were hired or appointed by the people to administer the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the people before the judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the people; and this was to enable them that they might be skilful in their profession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. But it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundations of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices-yea, well did he say that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of his angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will come down among my people, with equity and justice in my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with Amulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, according to their truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For behold, have I testified against your law? Ye do not understand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the destruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law. And now he says that he has not spoken against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts that they should remember these things against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he was the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them, having much business to do among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain according to their employ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
