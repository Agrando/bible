They doubted and marveled also because of the wickedness of the people, and this because of the success of the Lamanites over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
