I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God; by mine Only Begotten I created these things; yea, in the beginning I created the heaven, and the earth upon which thou standest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the earth was without form, and void; and I caused darkness to come up upon the face of the deep; and my Spirit moved upon the face of the water; for I am God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I, God, said: Let there be light; and there was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I, God, saw the light; and that light was good. And I, God, divided the light from the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I, God, called the light Day; and the darkness, I called Night; and this I did by the word of my power, and it was done as I spake; and the evening and the morning were the first day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And again, I, God, said: Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and it was so, even as I spake; and I said: Let it divide the waters from the waters; and it was done;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I, God, made the firmament and divided the waters, yea, the great waters under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament, and it was so even as I spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I, God, called the firmament Heaven; and the evening and the morning were the second day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I, God, said: Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and it was so; and I, God, said: Let there be dry land; and it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I, God, called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, called I the Sea; and I, God, saw that all things which I had made were good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I, God, said: Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, the fruit tree yielding fruit, after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed should be in itself upon the earth, and it was so even as I spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the earth brought forth grass, every herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed should be in itself, after his kind; and I, God, saw that all things which I had made were good;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I, God, said: Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth; and it was so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I, God, made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the greater light was the sun, and the lesser light was the moon; and the stars also were made even according to my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I, God, set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sun to rule over the day, and the moon to rule over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and I, God, saw that all things which I had made were good;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I, God, said: Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl which may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I, God, created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind; and I, God, saw that all things which I had created were good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I, God, blessed them, saying: Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the sea; and let fowl multiply in the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I, God, said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind, and it was so;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I, God, made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything which creepeth upon the earth after his kind; and I, God, saw that all these things were good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I, God, said unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and it was so.
