And are we not eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage? And our wives bear unto us children, and the same are mighty men, which are like unto men of old, men of great renown. And they hearkened not unto the words of Noah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God saw that the wickedness of men had become great in the earth; and every man was lifted up in the imagination of the thoughts of his heart, being only evil continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass that Noah continued his preaching unto the people, saying: Hearken, and give heed unto my words;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Believe and repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, even as our fathers, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost, that ye may have all things made manifest; and if ye do not this, the floods will come in upon you; nevertheless they hearkened not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it repented Noah, and his heart was pained that the Lord had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the Lord said: I will destroy man whom I have created, from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth Noah that I have created them, and that I have made them; and he hath called upon me; for they have sought his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And thus Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord; for Noah was a just man, and perfect in his generation; and he walked with God, as did also his three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The earth was corrupt before God, and it was filled with violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And God said unto Noah: The end of all flesh is come before me, for the earth is filled with violence, and behold I will destroy all flesh from off the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
