For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I, the Lord God, spake, and there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I, the Lord God, planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there I put the man whom I had formed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, to grow every tree, naturally, that is pleasant to the sight of man; and man could behold it. And it became also a living soul. For it was spiritual in the day that I created it; for it remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it, yea, even all things which I prepared for the use of man; and man saw that it was good for food. And I, the Lord God, planted the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I, the Lord God, caused a river to go out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I, the Lord God, called the name of the first Pison, and it compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where I, the Lord God, created much gold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the gold of that land was good, and there was bdellium and the onyx stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the name of the second river was called Gihon; the same that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the name of the third river was Hiddekel; that which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river was the Euphrates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten, that it was not good that the man should be alone; wherefore, I will make an help meet for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath of life, and commanded that whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, there was not found an help meet for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I, the Lord God, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and he slept, and I took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in the stead thereof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the rib which I, the Lord God, had taken from man, made I a woman, and brought her unto the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Adam said: This I know now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
