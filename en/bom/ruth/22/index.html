And Gideon said unto him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side of the city. The Lamanites, or the guards of the Lamanites, by night are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this people that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I will go according to thy command and pay the last tribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be drunken; and we will pass through the secret pass on the left of their camp when they are drunken and asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus we will depart with our women and our children, our flocks, and our herds into the wilderness; and we will travel around the land of Shilom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto the words of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And king Limhi caused that his people should gather their flocks together; and he sent the tribute of wine to the Lamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present unto them; and they did drink freely of the wine which king Limhi did send unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass that the people of king Limhi did depart by night into the wilderness with their flocks and their herds, and they went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness, and bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon and his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they had taken all their gold, and silver, and their precious things, which they could carry, and also their provisions with them, into the wilderness; and they pursued their journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after being many days in the wilderness they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah's people, and became his subjects.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass that Mosiah received them with joy; and he also received their records, and also the records which had been found by the people of Limhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had found that the people of Limhi had departed out of the land by night, that they sent an army into the wilderness to pursue them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And after they had pursued them two days, they could no longer follow their tracks; therefore they were lost in the wilderness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
