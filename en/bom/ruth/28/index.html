And the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass that Mosiah granted that they might go and do according to their request.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they took their journey into the wilderness to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an account of their proceedings hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for there was not any of his sons who would accept of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore he took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, and also the plates of Nephi, and all the things which he had kept and preserved according to the commandments of God, after having translated and caused to be written the records which were on the plates of gold which had been found by the people of Limhi, which were delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this he did because of the great anxiety of his people; for they were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those people who had been destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now he translated them by the means of those two stones which were fastened into the two rims of a bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now these things were prepared from the beginning, and were handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they have been kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he should discover to every creature who should possess the land the iniquities and abominations of his people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And whosoever has these things is called seer, after the manner of old times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records, behold, it gave an account of the people who were destroyed, from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this account shall be written hereafter; for behold, it is expedient that all people should know the things which are written in this account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, as I said unto you, that after king Mosiah had done these things, he took the plates of brass, and all the things which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
