Behold, I say unto you, that when his soul has been made an offering for sin he shall see his seed. And now what say ye? And who shall be his seed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold I say unto you, that whosoever has heard the words of the prophets, yea, all the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord-I say unto you, that all those who have hearkened unto their words, and believed that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins, I say unto you, that these are his seed, or they are the heirs of the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For these are they whose sins he has borne; these are they for whom he has died, to redeem them from their transgressions. And now, are they not his seed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean all the holy prophets ever since the world began? I say unto you that they are his seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these are they who have published peace, who have brought good tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And O how beautiful upon the mountains were their feet!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that are still publishing peace!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace, yea, from this time henceforth and forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For were it not for the redemption which he hath made for his people, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, I say unto you, were it not for this, all mankind must have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But behold, the bands of death shall be broken, and the Son reigneth, and hath power over the dead; therefore, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection; yea, even a resurrection of those that have been, and who are, and who shall be, even until the resurrection of Christ-for so shall he be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, the resurrection of all the prophets, and all those that have believed in their words, or all those that have kept the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first resurrection; therefore, they are the first resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They are raised to dwell with God who has redeemed them; thus they have eternal life through Christ, who has broken the bands of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And these are those who have part in the first resurrection; and these are they that have died before Christ came, in their ignorance, not having salvation declared unto them. And thus the Lord bringeth about the restoration of these; and they have a part in the first resurrection, or have eternal life, being redeemed by the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And little children also have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But behold, and fear, and tremble before God, for ye ought to tremble; for the Lord redeemeth none such that rebel against him and die in their sins; yea, even all those that have perished in their sins ever since the world began, that have wilfully rebelled against God, that have known the commandments of God, and would not keep them; these are they that have no part in the first resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore ought ye not to tremble? For salvation cometh to none such; for the Lord hath redeemed none such; yea, neither can the Lord redeem such; for he cannot deny himself; for he cannot deny justice when it has its claim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now I say unto you that the time shall come that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yea, Lord, thy watchmen shall lift up their voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
