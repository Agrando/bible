And he was a young man, and he believed the words which Abinadi had spoken, for he knew concerning the iniquity which Abinadi had testified against them; therefore he began to plead with the king that he would not be angry with Abinadi, but suffer that he might depart in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the king was more wroth, and caused that Alma should be cast out from among them, and sent his servants after him that they might slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But he fled from before them and hid himself that they found him not. And he being concealed for many days did write all the words which Abinadi had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass that the king caused that his guards should surround Abinadi and take him; and they bound him and cast him into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And after three days, having counseled with his priests, he caused that he should again be brought before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now Abinadi said unto him: I say unto you, I will not recall the words which I have spoken unto you concerning this people, for they are true; and that ye may know of their surety I have suffered myself that I have fallen into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you. And if ye slay me ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall also stand as a testimony against you at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now king Noah was about to release him, for he feared his word; for he feared that the judgments of God would come upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the priests lifted up their voices against him, and began to accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king. Therefore the king was stirred up in anger against him, and he delivered him up that he might be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass that they took him and bound him, and scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now when the flames began to scorch him, he cried unto them, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even the pains of death by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of diseases because of your iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that destroy his people. O God, receive my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, *when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
