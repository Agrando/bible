For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgressions of my people was he stricken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
