But they fought for their lives, and for their wives, and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves and like dragons did they fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites among the number of their dead; yet he was not dead, having been wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they took him and bound up his wounds, and brought him before Limhi, and said: Behold, here is the king of the Lamanites; he having received a wound has fallen among their dead, and they have left him; and behold, we have brought him before you; and now let us slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Limhi said unto them: Ye shall not slay him, but bring him hither that I may see him. And they brought him. And Limhi said unto him: What cause have ye to come up to war against my people? Behold, my people have not broken the oath that I made unto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath which ye made unto my people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now the king said: I have broken the oath because thy people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in my anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this matter; therefore he said: I will search among my people and whosoever has done this thing shall perish. Therefore he caused a search to be made among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now when Gideon had heard these things, he being the king's captain, he went forth and said unto the king: I pray thee forbear, and do not search this people, and lay not this thing to their charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For do ye not remember the priests of thy father, whom this people sought to destroy? And are they not in the wilderness? And are not they the ones who have stolen the daughters of the Lamanites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now, behold, and tell the king of these things, that he may tell his people that they may be pacified towards us; for behold they are already preparing to come against us; and behold also there are but few of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, they come with their numerous hosts; and except the king doth pacify them towards us we must perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For are not the words of Abinadi fulfilled, which he prophesied against us-and all this because we would not hearken unto the words of the Lord, and turn from our iniquities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil the oath which we have made unto him; for it is better that we should be in bondage than that we should lose our lives; therefore, let us put a stop to the shedding of so much blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now Limhi told the king all the things concerning his father, and the priests that had fled into the wilderness, and attributed the carrying away of their daughters to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass that the king was pacified towards his people; and he said unto them: Let us go forth to meet my people, without arms; and I swear unto you with an oath that my people shall not slay thy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass that they followed the king, and went forth without arms to meet the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did meet the Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites did bow himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of the people of Limhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the Lamanites saw the people of Limhi, that they were without arms, they had compassion on them and were pacified towards them, and returned with their king in peace to their own land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
