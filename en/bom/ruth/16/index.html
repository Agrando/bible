Therefore he is as though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now if Christ had not come into the world, speaking of things to come as though they had already come, there could have been no redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if Christ had not risen from the dead, or have broken the bands of death that the grave should have no victory, and that death should have no sting, there could have been no resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But there is a resurrection, therefore the grave hath no victory, and the sting of death is swallowed up in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He is the light and the life of the world; yea, a light that is endless, that can never be darkened; yea, and also a life which is endless, that there can be no more death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even this mortal shall put on immortality, and this corruption shall put on incorruption, and shall be brought to stand before the bar of God, to be judged of him according to their works whether they be good or whether they be evil-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If they be good, to the resurrection of endless life and happiness; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of endless damnation, being delivered up to the devil, who hath subjected them, which is damnation-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended towards them, and they would not; they being warned of their iniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were commanded to repent and yet they would not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and remember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, if ye teach the law of Moses, also teach that it is a shadow of those things which are to come-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father.
