Therefore he consecrated all their priests and all their teachers; and none were consecrated except they were just men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore they did watch over their people, and did nourish them with things pertaining to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass that they began to prosper exceedingly in the land; and they called the land Helam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass that they did multiply and prosper exceedingly in the land of Helam; and they built a city, which they called the city of Helam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless the Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless-whosoever putteth his trust in him the same shall be lifted up at the last day. Yea, and thus it was with this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For behold, I will show unto you that they were brought into bondage, and none could deliver them but the Lord their God, yea, even the God of Abraham and Isaac and of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass that he did deliver them, and he did show forth his mighty power unto them, and great were their rejoicings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For behold, it came to pass that while they were in the land of Helam, yea, in the city of Helam, while tilling the land round about, behold an army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now it came to pass that the brethren of Alma fled from their fields, and gathered themselves together in the city of Helam; and they were much frightened because of the appearance of the Lamanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them that they should not be frightened, but that they should remember the Lord their God and he would deliver them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they would spare them, and their wives, and their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites. And Alma and his brethren went forth and delivered themselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession of the land of Helam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now the armies of the Lamanites, which had followed after the people of king Limhi, had been lost in the wilderness for many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And behold, they had found those priests of king Noah, in a place which they called Amulon; and they had begun to possess the land of Amulon and had begun to till the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the name of the leader of those priests was Amulon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And it came to pass that Amulon did plead with the Lamanites; and he also sent forth their wives, who were the daughters of the Lamanites, to plead with their brethren, that they should not destroy their husbands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the Lamanites had compassion on Amulon and his brethren, and did not destroy them, because of their wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Amulon and his brethren did join the Lamanites, and they were traveling in the wilderness in search of the land of Nephi when they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by Alma and his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass that the Lamanites promised unto Alma and his brethren, that if they would show them the way which led to the land of Nephi that they would grant unto them their lives and their liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But after Alma had shown them the way that led to the land of Nephi the Lamanites would not keep their promise; but they set guards round about the land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a part of them returned to the land of Helam, and also brought with them the wives and the children of the guards who had been left in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto Amulon that he should be a king and a ruler over his people, who were in the land of Helam; nevertheless he should have no power to do anything contrary to the will of the king of the Lamanites.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
