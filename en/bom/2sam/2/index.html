And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this band of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed according to the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him.
