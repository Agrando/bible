That I may tell you of your iniquities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I might pour out my soul unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of your iniquities!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And because of my mourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel because ye are given away that the devil has got so great hold upon your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea, how could you have given way to the enticing of him who is seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>O repent ye, repent ye! Why will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto the Lord your God. Why has he forsaken you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him to anger against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And behold, instead of gathering you, except ye will repent, behold, he shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O, how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that he has delivered you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men, yea, and that ye might get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent. For if ye will not repent, behold, this great city, and also all those great cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those who repent of their sins, and hearken unto my words. Now therefore, I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yea, wo be unto you because of that great abomination which has come among you; and ye have united yourselves unto it, yea, to that secret band which was established by Gadianton!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yea, wo shall come unto you because of that pride which ye have suffered to enter your hearts, which has lifted you up beyond that which is good because of your exceedingly great riches!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness and abominations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And except ye repent ye shall perish; yea, even your lands shall be taken from you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Behold now, I do not say that these things shall be, of myself, because it is not of myself that I know these things; but behold, I know that these things are true because the Lord God has made them known unto me, therefore I testify that they shall be.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
