And there are different ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, to profit them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For behold, to one is given by the Spirit of God, that he may teach the word of wisdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And to another, that he may teach the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And to another, exceedingly great faith; and to another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, to another, that he may work mighty miracles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, to another, that he may prophesy concerning all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And again, to another, the beholding of angels and ministering spirits;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And again, to another, all kinds of tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And again, to another, the interpretation of languages and of divers kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And all these gifts come by the Spirit of Christ; and they come unto every man severally, according as he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that every good gift cometh of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that all these gifts of which I have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even as long as the world shall stand, only according to the unbelief of the children of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and if there must be hope there must also be charity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And except ye have charity ye can in nowise be saved in the kingdom of God; neither can ye be saved in the kingdom of God if ye have not faith; neither can ye if ye have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if ye have no hope ye must needs be in despair; and despair cometh because of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Christ truly said unto our fathers: If ye have faith ye can do all things which are expedient unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And now I speak unto all the ends of the earth-that if the day cometh that the power and gifts of God shall be done away among you, it shall be because of unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case; for there shall be none that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And wo unto them who shall do these things away and die, for they die in their sins, and they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God; and I speak it according to the words of Christ; and I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And behold, they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God; and his word shall hiss forth from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And God shall show unto you, that that which I have written is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And again I would exhort you that ye would come unto Christ, and lay hold upon every good gift, and touch not the evil gift, nor the unclean thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
