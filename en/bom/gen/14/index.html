I said unto him, Yea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look, and behold that great and abominable church, which is the mother of abominations, whose founder is the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said unto me: Behold there are save two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness of the great whore whom I saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all the earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the angel said unto me: Behold one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, he shall see and write the remainder of these things; yea, and also many things which have been.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he shall also write concerning the end of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Wherefore, the things which he shall write are just and true; and behold they are written in the book which thou beheld proceeding out of the mouth of the Jew; and at the time they proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, or, at the time the book proceeded out of the mouth of the Jew, the things which were written were plain and pure, and most precious and easy to the understanding of all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold, the things which this apostle of the Lamb shall write are many things which thou hast seen; and behold, the remainder shalt thou see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the things which thou shalt see hereafter thou shalt not write; for the Lord God hath ordained the apostle of the Lamb of God that he should write them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all things, and they have written them; and they are sealed up to come forth in their purity, according to the truth which is in the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the apostle of the Lamb was John, according to the word of the angel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the remainder of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore the things which I have written sufficeth me; and I have written but a small part of the things which I saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I bear record that I saw the things which my father saw, and the angel of the Lord did make them known unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which I saw while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the things which I saw are not written, the things which I have written are true. And thus it is. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
