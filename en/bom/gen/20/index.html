I did show them suddenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I did it because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I have even from the beginning declared to thee; before it came to pass I showed them thee; and I showed them for fear lest thou shouldst say-Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image hath commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye not declare them? And that I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not from the beginning, even before the day when thou heardest them not they were declared unto thee, lest thou shouldst say-Behold I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nevertheless, for my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, behold, I have refined thee, I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake will I do this, for I will not suffer my name to be polluted, and I will not give my glory unto another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called, for I am he; I am the first, and I am also the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Mine hand hath also laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens. I call unto them and they stand up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who among them hath declared these things unto them? The Lord hath loved him; yea, and he will fulfil his word which he hath declared by them; and he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall come upon the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord, yea, I have spoken; yea, I have called him to declare, I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in secret; from the beginning, from the time that it was declared have I spoken; and the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I have sent him, the Lord thy God who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way thou shouldst go, hath done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments-then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thy seed also had been as the sand; the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter to the end of the earth; say ye: The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they thirsted not; he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And notwithstanding he hath done all this, and greater also, there is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
