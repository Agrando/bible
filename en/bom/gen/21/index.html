Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken ye people from far; the Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And said unto me: Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for naught and in vain; surely my judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now, saith the Lord-that formed me from the womb that I should be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him-though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said: It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nations abhorreth, to servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus saith the Lord: In an acceptable time have I heard thee, O isles of the sea, and in a day of salvation have I helped thee; and I will preserve thee, and give thee my servant for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That thou mayest say to the prisoners: Go forth; to them that sit in darkness: Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And then, O house of Israel, behold, these shall come from far; and lo, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of those who are in the east shall be established; and break forth into singing, O mountains; for they shall be smitten no more; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But, behold, Zion hath said: The Lord hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten me-but he will show that he hath not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thy children shall make haste against thy destroyers; and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lift up thine eyes round about and behold; all these gather themselves together, and they shall come to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on even as a bride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants; and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The children whom thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the first, shall again in thine ears say: The place is too strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then shalt thou say in thine heart: Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? And who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where have they been?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thus saith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I, the Lord, am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
