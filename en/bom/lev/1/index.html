And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let them be of whatever name they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass that Nephi died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the people which were not Lamanites were Nephites; nevertheless, they were called Nephites, Jacobites, Josephites, Zoramites, Lamanites, Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now it came to pass that the people of Nephi, under the reign of the second king, began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulge themselves somewhat in wicked practices, such as like unto David of old desiring many wives and concubines, and also Solomon, his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea, and they also began to search much gold and silver, and began to be lifted up somewhat in pride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Wherefore I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in the temple, having first obtained mine errand from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I, Jacob, and my brother Joseph had been consecrated priests and teachers of this people, by the hand of Nephi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And we did magnify our office unto the Lord, taking upon us the responsibility, answering the sins of the people upon our own heads if we did not teach them the word of God with all diligence; wherefore, by laboring with our might their blood might not come upon our garments; otherwise their blood would come upon our garments, and we would not be found spotless at the last day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
