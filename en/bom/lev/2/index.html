For behold, as I inquired of the Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying: Jacob, get thou up into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall give thee unto this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And now behold, my brethren, this is the word which I declare unto you, that many of you have begun to search for gold, and for silver, and for all manner of precious ores, in the which this land, which is a land of promise unto you and to your seed, doth abound most plentifully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly, that you have obtained many riches; and because some of you have obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff necks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel, and persecute your brethren because ye suppose that ye are better than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now, my brethren, do ye suppose that God justifieth you in this thing? Behold, I say unto you, Nay. But he condemneth you, and if ye persist in these things his judgments must speedily come unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>O that he would show you that he can pierce you, and with one glance of his eye he can smite you to the dust!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O that he would rid you from this iniquity and abomination. And, O that ye would listen unto the word of his commands, and let not this pride of your hearts destroy your souls!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But before ye seek for riches, seek ye for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good-to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, my brethren, I have spoken unto you concerning pride; and those of you which have afflicted your neighbor, and persecuted him because ye were proud in your hearts, of the things which God hath given you, what say ye of it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do ye not suppose that such things are abominable unto him who created all flesh? And the one being is as precious in his sight as the other. And all flesh is of the dust; and for the selfsame end hath he created them, that they should keep his commandments and glorify him forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I make an end of speaking unto you concerning this pride. And were it not that I must speak unto you concerning a grosser crime, my heart would rejoice exceedingly because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem, yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness and abominations of their husbands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will not suffer, saith the Lord of Hosts, that the cries of the fair daughters of this people, which I have led out of the land of Jerusalem, shall come up unto me against the men of my people, saith the Lord of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my people because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with a sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit whoredoms, like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments were given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them before; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done these things which ye ought not to have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren. Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you. And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
