Ought you not rather to have mourned? Let the one who has done this be removed from your midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For though I am absent in body, I am present in spirit, and have already passed judgment on the one who has committed this, as if I were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, and the power of our Lord Jesus is present,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened.
