He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If even lifeless things, such as the flute or the harp, do not give a distinction in the notes, how will any one know what is played?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So it is with you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is intelligible, how will anyone know what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Undoubtedly there are many languages in the world, and none of them is without meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the one who is speaking, and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So it is with you; since you are eager for spiritual gifts, strive to excel in building up the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how can any one in the position of an outsider say the »Amen« to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; be infants in evil, but in thinking be mature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written, »By men of strange tonguesand by the lips of foreignerswill I speak to this people,and even then they will not listen to me,says the Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Tongues, then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; but prophecy is for believers, not for unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if the whole church assembles together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so, he will fall on his face, and worship God, declaring that God is really among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What is the outcome then, brethren? When you come together, each one has a hymn, or a teaching, or a revelation, or a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn; and one must interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if a revelation is made to another who is sitting, the first one must keep silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be submissive, as even the law says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Did the word of God originate with you? Or are you the only people it has reached?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But all things should be done decently and in an orderly way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
