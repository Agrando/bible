Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am thankful that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that no one would say you were baptized in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(Now I did baptize also the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any one else.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospelnot with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written, »I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the cleverness of the clever I will frustrate.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jews demand signs and Greeks look for wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are the called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to fleshly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>God chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so that no flesh may boast before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>therefore, as it is written, »Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
