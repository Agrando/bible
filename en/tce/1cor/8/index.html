Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many »gods« and many »lords«),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we exist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, being accustomed to idols, eat food as really sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But food will not commend us to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if a man sees you, who have knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, if food causes my brother to fall, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to fall.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
