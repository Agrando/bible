Indeed, even now you are not ready,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>for you are still carnal. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not carnal, and are you not walking like mere men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For when one says, »I am of Paul,« and another, »I am of Apollos,« are you not mere men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord assigned to each one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are God's fellow workers; you are Gods field, Gods building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man must be careful how he builds on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For no other foundation can any one lay than the one which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if any man builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>each man's work will become evident; for the day will show it, because it is to be revealed with fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of each mans work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man's work which he has built on it survives, he will receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that you are God's temple and that Gods Spirit dwells in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For Gods temple is holy, and that temple you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age, he must become a fool so that he may become wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, »He catches the wise in their own craftiness«;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and again, »The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise,that they are futile.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So then let no one boast of men. For all things are yours,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future; all belong to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and you belong to Christ; and Christ belongs to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
