Send him on his way in peace, that he may return to me; for I am expecting him with the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As for our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to come to you with the other brethren, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be on the your guard, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let all that you do be done in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to be subject to such men and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have supplied what was lacking on your part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For they refreshed my spirit and yours also. Give recognition to such men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the lord, with the church that is in their house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All the brethren send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I, Paul, write this greeting in my own hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If anyone does not love the LordÂ—let him be accursed. Come, O Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The grace of The Lord Jesus be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My love be with you all in Christ Jesus.
