And if the world is to be judged by you, are you not competent to try trivial cases?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we will judge angels? How much more matters of this life!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So if you have disputes about such matters, do you appoint them as judges who are of no account in the church?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between his brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Actually, then, it is already a defeat for you, that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Instead, you yourselves defraud and do wrong, and you even do this to your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»All things are lawful for me,« but not all things are helpful. »All things are lawful for me,« but I will not be mastered by anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food«but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>By his power God raised the Lord, and he will also raise us up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or do you not know that he who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, »The two shall become one flesh.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who unites himself with the Lord is one spirit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>you were bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
