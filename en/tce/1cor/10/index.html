And God is faithful, who will not let you be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, so that you will be able to endure it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I speak as to sensible men; judge for yourselves what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Consider Israel after the flesh; are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What do I mean then? That a thing offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No, but I say that the things pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»All things are lawful,« but not all things are helpful. »All things are lawful,« but not all things build up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for, »The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you want to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising questions of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if anyone says to you, »This has been offered in sacrifice,« then do not eat it, both for the sake of the man who informed you and for conscience' sake</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>the other man's conscience, I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>just as I try to please all men in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
