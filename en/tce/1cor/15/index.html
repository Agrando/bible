No, I worked harder than all of themyet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and so is your faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>More than that, we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since by a man came death, by a man came also the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then, at his coming, those who belong to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all rule and all authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»For God has put all things in subjection under his feet.« But when it says, »All things are put in subjection under him,« it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are people baptized for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Why are we also in danger every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I protest, brethren, by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus for merely human reasons, what have I gained? If the dead are not raised, »Let us eat and drink,for tomorrow we die.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not be deceived: »Bad company corrupts good morals.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But someone will ask, »How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And that which you sow, you do not sow the body which is to be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of something else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives it a body as he has determined, and to each kind of seed he gives its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of animals, another of birds, and another of fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So is it with the resurrection of the dead. It is sown a perishable body, it is raised imperishable;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So it is written, »The first man Adam became a living being«; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; and then the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man was from the earth, of dust; the second man is from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now I tell you this, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then will come to pass the saying that is written: »Death is swallowed up in victory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>»O death, where is your victory?O death, where is your sting?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
