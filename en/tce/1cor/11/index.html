And all things are from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone wants to be contentious, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But in the following instructions, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore when you meet together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal, and one is hungry and another is drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? No, I will not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, »This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way he took the cup also after supper, saying, »This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So then, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you will not come together for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
