If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has arranged the members in the body, each one of them, just as he desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If they were all one member, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As it is, there are many parts, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, »I have no need of you,« nor again the head to the feet, »I have no need of you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and those parts of the body which we think less honorable we treat with the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>while our more presentable members have no need of it. But God has so composed the body, giving the greater honor to the parts that lacked it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>so that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then those having gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and those speaking in various kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
