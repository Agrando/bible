He took what was hostile away from us, nailing it to the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore let no one judge you in questions of food or drink or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things are only a shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one disqualify you for the prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of the angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen, puffed up without cause by his fleshly mind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and not holding fast to the head, from whom the whole body, nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If with Christ you died to the elementary principles of the world, why, as if you still belonged to it, do you submit to regulations such as,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>(referring to things which are all destined perish with use), according to human commandments and teachings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These indeed have an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but they are of no value against fleshly indulgence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
