do not let the sun go down on your anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and do not give the devil an opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He who has been stealing must steal no longer, but rather must labor, doing useful work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with those in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let no unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building others up according to the need of the moment, that it may impart grace to those who hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Be kind and tenderhearted to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
