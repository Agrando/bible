In love</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>to the praise of his glorious grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>which he lavished on us.
