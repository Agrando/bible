To his own master he stands or falls. And he will be made to stand, for the Master is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One man esteems one day as better than another; another man esteems every day alike. Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains, does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written: »As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me,and every tongue shall confess to God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another anymore, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in our brothers way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If your brother is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not by your eating destroy the one for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So do not let your good be spoken of as evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>he who serves Christ in this way is acceptable to God and approved by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let us therefore pursue what makes for peace and for mutual edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is right not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that makes your brother stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself for what he approves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
