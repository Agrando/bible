And how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, »How beautiful are the feet of those who preach good news!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, »Lord, who has believed our message?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have; for »Their voice has gone out to all the earth,and their words to the ends of the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, »I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation;by a foolish nation I will make you angry.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Isaiah is very bold and says, »I was found by those who did not seek me;I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But of Israel he says, »All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
