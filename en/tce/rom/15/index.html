As it is written: »Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles,and sing to your name«;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and again it says: »Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and again, »Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles,and praise him, all you peoples«;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, Isaiah says: »There shall be a root of Jesse;and he who shall rise to rule over the Gentiles,in him the Gentiles shall hope.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I myself am satisfied about you, my brethren, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again, because of the grace that was given me from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles might be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore I have reason to glory in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the Gentiles, by word and deed</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit, so that from Jerusalem and as far round as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And so I have made it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on another man's foundation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but as it is written: »They shall see who have not been told of him,and those who have not heard shall understand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This is the reason why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now, since I no longer have any place for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I plan to do so when I go to Spain. I hope to see you while passing through, and to be helped by you on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now, however, I am going to Jerusalem with aid for the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They were pleased to do it, and indeed they are in debt to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When therefore I have completed this, and have delivered to them this fruit, I shall go on by way of you to Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>so that by God's will I may come to you with joy, and together with you be refreshed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The God of peace be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
