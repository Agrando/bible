But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and though she marries another man, she is not an adulteress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Likewise, my brethren, you have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now, by dying to what once held us, we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, and not in the old way of the written code.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! Indeed, I would not have known what sin was except through the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, »You shall not covet.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, finding opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetous desire. For apart from the law sin lies dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The very commandment which was to bring life I found to be death to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, deceived me, and by it killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and just and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Certainly not! But it was sin, working death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be recognized as sin, so that through the commandment sin might become sinful beyond measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I do not understand what I do. For I do not do what I want to do, but I do what I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So then, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will to do what is good, but I cannot do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I do not do the good I want to do; but the evil I do not want to do is what I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So I find it to be a law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I see in my members another law, at war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin which dwells in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thanks be to Godthrough Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
