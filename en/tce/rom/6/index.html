Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Certainly not! How can we who died to sin live any longer in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Or do you not know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We were buried therefore with him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For he who has died has been freed from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So you also, consider yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you obey its passions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of wickedness, but yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For sin shall not have dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Certainly not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to any one to obey as slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, whether of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and, having been set free from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am speaking in human terms, because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you once yielded your members to impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now yield your members to righteousness for holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But then what return did you get from the things of which you are now ashamed? The end of those things is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the return you get is holiness and its end, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
