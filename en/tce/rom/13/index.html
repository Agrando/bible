For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist have been instituted by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore he who resists the authority resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to have no fear of him who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will have praise from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain; he is Gods servant, an avenger to execute wrath on the wrongdoer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore one must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for the sake of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the same reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God's ministers, attending to this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Pay all of them their dues: taxes to whom taxes are due, revenue to whom revenue is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no one anything, except to love one another; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The commandments, »You shall not commit adultery,« »You shall not murder,« »You shall not steal,« »You shall not covet,« and any other commandment there may be, are summed up in this sentence, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love does no harm to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And do this, knowing the hour, that now it is full time for you to wake from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far gone, the day is at hand. Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in reveling and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust, not in quarreling and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
