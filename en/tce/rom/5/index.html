For if by the one man's trespass many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the free gift is not like the effect of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the gift following many trespasses brings justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if, by the one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then, as one man's trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one mans act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Law came in, that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
