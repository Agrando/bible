For we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then was it reckoned to him? Was it after he had been circumcised, or before? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness which he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised, in order that righteousness might be reckoned to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he is also the father of the circumcised who are not only circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith which our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The promise to Abraham and his descendants, that he would be heir of the world, was not through the law but through the righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if those who are of the law are to be the heirs, faith has no value and the promise is void,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>because the law brings wrath, for where there is no law there is no transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, the promise comes by faith, so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all his descendantsnot only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of Abraham, for he is the father of us all</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(as it is written, »I have made you the father of many nations«) in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls things that do not exist as though they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In hope, he believed against hope, so that he became the father of many nations; as he had been told, »So shall your descendants be.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old, or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>being fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>That is why it was »reckoned to him as righteousness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the words, »it was reckoned to him,« were written not for his sake alone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but for us also. It will be reckoned to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was delivered to death for our sins and was raised for our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
