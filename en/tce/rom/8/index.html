And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ he does not belong to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if Christ is in you, although your body is dead because of sin, your spirit is alive because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit who dwells in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, brethren, we are debtorsnot to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of sonship by whom we cry out, »Abba, Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if children, then heirsheirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with him, in order that we may also be glorified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the creation waits with eager expectation for the revealing of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will, but by the will of him who subjected it in hope;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>We know that the whole creation has been groaning in birth pangs together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For in this hope we were saved. But hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who are called according to his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And those whom he predestined, he also called; those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified, he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also give us all things with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes, who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who is also interceding for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As it is written: »For your sake we are being killed all the day long;we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
