So they are without excuse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for although they knew God they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>because they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And since they did not see fit to retain the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a base mind, to do what ought not to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness, depravity. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malice; they are gossips,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Though they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
