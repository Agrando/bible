Certainly not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Lord, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what is God's reply to him? »I have reserved for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if it is by grace, then it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? Israel did not obtain what it sought. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>as it is written: »God gave them a spirit of stupor,eyes that they should not seeand ears that they should not hear,down to this very day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David says: »Let their table become a snare and a trap,a stumbling block and a retribution for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see,and bend their backs forever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I ask, have they stumbled so as to fall? Certainly not! But through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness mean!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in the hope that I may somehow arouse to jealousy the kinsmen of my flesh and save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, then the whole lump is holy; and if the root is holy, so are the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the rest to share the root of the olive tree,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>do not boast over the branches. If you do boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say then, »Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast only by faith. So do not be proud, but stand in awe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore consider the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who fell, but kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they also, if they do not persist in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: »The Deliverer will come from Zion,he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and this will be my covenant with themwhen I take away their sins.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your sake; but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Just as you were once disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so they have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may receive mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has bound all men over to disobedience, that he may have mercy upon all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Oh, the depth of the riches and of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»For who has known the mind of the Lord?Or who has been his counselor?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Or who has given a gift to himthat he might be repaid?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
