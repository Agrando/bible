And so we are! The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone who commits sin also commits lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you know that he appeared to take away our sins, and in him there is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No one who abides in him sins. No one who sins has either seen him or known him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Little children, let no one deceive you. He who does right is righteous, just as he is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who commits sin is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>No one who is of God practices sin, for GodÂ’s seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and not be like Cain who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love abides in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, let us not love in word or tongue but in deed and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By this we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence before God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and we receive from him whatever we ask, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his commandment: that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as he has commanded us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now those who keep his commandments abide in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
