And his commandments are not burdensome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the worldour faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is it that overcomes the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is he who came by water and bloodJesus Christ; not only by water, but by water and blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There are three witnesses, the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God which he has borne witness of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has given of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence which we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he will ask, and God will give him life for those whose sin is not leading to death. There is sin leading to death. I do not say that he should pray about that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that anyone born of God does not sin; but he who was born of God keeps him, and the evil one does not touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are of God, and the whole world is under the power of the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Little children, keep yourselves from idols.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
