This is the spirit of the Antichrist, of which you have heard that it was coming, and now it is in the world already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are of the world and therefore speak as of the world, and the world listens to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are of God. Whoever knows God listens to us; he who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who does not love does not know God, for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No one has ever seen God; but if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son as the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So we know and believe the love God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In this love is perfected among us, that we may have confidence for the Day of Judgment, because as he is so are we in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. And he who fears is not made perfect in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love because he first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If anyone says, »I love God,« and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this commandment we have from him: that he who loves God must love his brother also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
