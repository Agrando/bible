But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may have less anxiety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So receive him in the Lord with all joy; and honor men like him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because he almost died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
