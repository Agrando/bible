Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be ashamed in anything, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I am to live on in the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to remain on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that your proud confidence in me may abound in Christ Jesus through my coming to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I will hear of you that you stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>in no way frightened by your opponents. This is a sign of destruction to them, but of salvation for you Â– and that too, from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to you it has been granted for the sake of Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
