To write the same things to you again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Watch out for the dogs, watch out for the evil workers, watch out for those mutilators of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For we are the true circumcision, who worship in the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>though I myself have reasons for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But whatever was gain to me, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>More than that, I count everything to be loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christthe righteousness that comes from God and is by faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming like him in his death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not that I have already obtained this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Brethren, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it; but one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let those of us who are mature have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Only let us live up to what we have already attained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Brethren, join in following my example, and observe those who live according to the pattern you have in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
