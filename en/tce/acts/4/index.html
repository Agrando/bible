For that a noteworthy miracle has been performed through them is apparent to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no longer to any one in this name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered them, »Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for we cannot stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people; for all the people were praising God for what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When they had been released, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they heard this, they lifted their voices to God together and said, »Sovereign Lord, it is you who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and everything in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who by the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of our father David your servant, said, Why did the gentiles rage,and the peoples plot futile things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth took their stand,and the rulers were gathered togetheragainst the Lord and against his Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your word with all boldness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders take place through the name of your holy servant Jesus.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place where they were gathered together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one claimed that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power the apostles gave their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For there was not a needy person among them, For all who were owners of land or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of the sales</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus Joseph who was called by the apostles Barnabas (which means, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>sold a field which he owned, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
