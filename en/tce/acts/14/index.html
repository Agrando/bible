We also are men, of like nature with you, and bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>yet he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even with these words, they had difficulty keeping the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jews came there from Antioch and Iconium; and having won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But after the disciples had gathered around him, he got up and entered the city. And the next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, »Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They passed through Pisidia, and came into Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When they arrived, they gathered the church together and declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they spent a long time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
