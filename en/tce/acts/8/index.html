And on that day a great persecution arose against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the region of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul began ravaging the church, and, entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now those who had been scattered went about preaching the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Philip went down to a city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The crowds with one accord were giving attention to what was said by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So there was much joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now there was a man named Simon, who had formerly practiced magic in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and they all, from the least to the greatest, gave attention to him, saying, »This man is what is called the Great Power of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they gave heed to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, »Give me also this power, so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, »May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have no part or share in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Simon answered, »Pray for me to the Lord, so that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But an angel of the Lord said to Philip, »Get up and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.« This is a desert road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he got up and went. And there was an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure; and he had come to Jerusalem to worship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the Spirit said to Philip, »Go up and join this chariot.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Philip ran up to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, »Do you understand what you are reading?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, »How can I, unless someone guides me?« And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: »He was led as a sheep to slaughter;and as a lamb before its shearer is silent,so he does not open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his humiliation justice was denied him.Who can describe his generation?For his life is taken up from the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the eunuch said to Philip, »Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this scripture he told him the good news of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went along the road they came to some water; and the eunuch said, »Look, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?«</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="37">37</a></span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away; and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he kept preaching the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
