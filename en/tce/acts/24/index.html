But there were some Jews from Asia</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who ought to be here before you and to make accusation, if they should have anything against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Or else let these men themselves tell what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the Council,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>except this one thing which I shouted out while standing among them, With respect to the resurrection of the dead I am on trial before you today.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Felix, having a more exact knowledge about the Way, put them off, saying, »When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody but have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to his needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But some days later Felix came with Drusilla, his wife who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as he was discussing righteousness, self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became frightened and said, »Go away for the present, and when I find time I will summon you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At the same time, he was hoping that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus, and desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
