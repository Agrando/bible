And for this hope, O King, I am being accused by Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And that is just what I did in Jerusalem; I not only shut up many of the saints in prison, by authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as I punished them often in all the synagogues, I tried to force them to blaspheme; and being furiously enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»On one of these journeys I was going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At midday, O King, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But get up and stand on your feet; for this purpose I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness to the things which you have seen of me, and also to the things in which I will appear to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»So, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but declared first to those at Damascus, then at Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God and perform deeds worthy of their repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would happen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the Christ must suffer, and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as he was saying this in his defense, Festus said in a loud voice, »Paul, you are out of your mind! Your great learning is driving you mad.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Paul said, »I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the sober truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Agrippa said to Paul, »In a short time you think to persuade me to become a Christian!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paul said, »Whether in a short or a long time, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I amexcept for these chains.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king rose and the governor and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and when they had gone aside, they began talking to one another, saying, »This man is not doing anything worthy of death or imprisonment.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, »This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
