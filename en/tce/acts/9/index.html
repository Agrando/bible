And after laying his hands on him said, »Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you were coming, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he regained his sight. And he got up and was baptized,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he took food and was strengthened. Now for several days he was with the disciples who were at Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, »He is the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All those who heard him were amazed, and said, »Is this not he who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called on this name, and who had come here for the purpose of bringing them bound before the chief priests?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived at Damascus by proving that this Jesus is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night, to kill him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples; but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. And he declared to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was with them moving about freely in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he was talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when the brethren learned of it, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria enjoyed peace and was built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it continued to increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now as Peter went through all those regions, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>There he found a man named Aeneas, who had been bedridden for eight years and was paralyzed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Peter said to him, »Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; get up and make your bed.« Immediately he got up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha (which is translated Dorcas). She was full of good works and acts of charity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And at that time she fell sick and died; and when they had washed her, they laid her body in an upper room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, imploring him, »Please come to us without delay.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing the tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Peter sent them all out and knelt down and prayed; then turning to the body, he said, »Tabitha, arise.« And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows he presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It became known all over Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Peter stayed for many days in Joppa with a tanner named Simon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
