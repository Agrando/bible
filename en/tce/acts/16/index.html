A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer; but his father was a Greek,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Paul wanted this man to accompany him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions which had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in numbers daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they came to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>so passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and begging him, and saying, »Come over to Macedonia and help us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and from there to Philippi, which is the leading city of the district of Macedonia, and a Roman colony. We stayed in this city some days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, who was a worshiper of God, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, »If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.« And she prevailed upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave-girl who had a spirit of divination. She brought her owners much profit by fortune-telling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She followed Paul and the rest of us, crying, »These men are servants of the Most High God, who are telling you the way of salvation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, »I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!« And it came out at that very moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when her owners saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and when they had brought them to the magistrates they said, »These men are Jews and they are throwing our city into an uproar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The crowd joined against them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and ordered them to be beaten with rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, charging the jailer to guard them securely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul cried with a loud voice, »Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He brought them out and said, »Sirs, what must I do to be saved?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They said, »Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then he brought them up into his house, and set food before them; and he rejoiced with his whole household that he had believed in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But when it was day, the magistrates sent their police, saying, »Release those men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, »The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore come out now and go in peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul said to them, »They have beaten us publicly, without trial, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now cast us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So they came and apologized to them, and they took them out and asked them to leave the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
