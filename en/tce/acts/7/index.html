The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and said to him, Leave your country and your relatives, and go into the land that I will show you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, God had him move to this country in which you are now living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot of ground, and yet, even though he had no child, he promised that he would give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But God spoke to this effect, that his descendants would be aliens in a foreign land, and that they would be enslaved and mistreated for four hundred years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I will judge the nation which they serve, said God, and after that they will come out and worship me in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and rescued him from all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers there the first time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family was made known to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives to him, seventy-five persons in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jacob went down to Egypt, and there he and our fathers died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>until there arose another king over Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He dealt craftily with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not survive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At this time Moses was born, and was beautiful before God. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and when he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter took him and brought him up as her own son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he saw one of them being treated unjustly, he defended him and avenged the oppressed by striking down the Egyptian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he supposed that his brethren understood that God was granting them deliverance through him, but they did not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On the following day he appeared to two of them as they were fighting, and tried to reconcile them, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong each other?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the man who was wronging his neighbor pushed him aside, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At this remark Moses fled, and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight; and as he approached to look more closely, there came the voice of the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. Moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Lord said to him, Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I have certainly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Come now, and I will send you to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This Moses whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? is the one God sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he received living oracles to pass on to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But our fathers refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>saying to Aaron, Make for us gods who will go before us; as for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egyptwe do not know what has happened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>At that time they made a calf and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices,forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You took up the tent of Moloch,and the star of the god Rephan,the figures which you made to worship.And I will remove you beyond Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern which he had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And having received it in their turn, our fathers brought it in with Joshua when they took the land from the nations whom God drove out before our fathers. So it was until the time of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who found favor in God's sight, and asked that he might find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But it was Solomon who built a house for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>However, the Most High does not dwell in houses made by human hands; as the prophet says:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Heaven is my throne,and the earth is my footstool.What kind of house will you build for me? says the Lord,or what is the place of my rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Has not my hand made all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. You are doing just as your fathers did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>you who received the law as delivered by angels, and yet did not keep it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But being full of the Holy Spirit, he gazed intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and he said, »Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But they cried out with a loud voice, and covered their ears and rushed together upon him with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Then they cast him out of the city and began to stone him; and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, »Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Then he fell on his knees and cried out with a loud voice, »Lord, do not hold this sin against them.« And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
