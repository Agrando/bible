And they had John as their helper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet, named Bar-Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) was opposing them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said, »You who are full of all deceit and fraud, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not stop making crooked the straight ways of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time.« And immediately a mist and a darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking someone to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had happened, for he was amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia; but John left them and returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But they passed on from Perga and came to Pisidian Antioch. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After the reading of the law and the prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, »Brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, »Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And after he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; concerning whom he testified and said, I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>From this man's descendants God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Before his coming John had preached a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as John was completing his course, he said, What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you that fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor the utterances of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled these by condemning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Though they found no ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised him from the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and for many days he appeared to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we preach to you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm: You are my Son;today I have begotten you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to decay, he spoke in this way: I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore he also says in another Psalm, You will not let your Holy One see decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers and saw decay;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but he whom God raised did not see decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through him forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and through him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore take care, so that what is said in the prophets may not come upon you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Behold, you scoffers,and wonder, and perish;for I am going to do a deed in your days,a deed you will never believe,if someone declares it to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people begged that these things might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who spoke to them and urged them to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted what was spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, »It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first. Since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so the Lord has commanded us: I have made you a light for the Gentiles,that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord; and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the word of the Lord spread through the whole region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So they shook off the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
