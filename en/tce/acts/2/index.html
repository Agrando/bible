name="1">1</a>When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And there appeared to them tongues as of fire distributing themselves, and they rested on each one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men from every nation under heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And at this sound the crowd came together, and they were bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They were amazed and wondered, saying, »Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And how is it that we hear them, each of us in his own native language?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Cretans and Arabswe hear them in our own tongues speaking of the mighty deeds of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, »What does this mean?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But others were mocking and said, »They are full of sweet wine.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter, taking his stand with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed them: »Men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to you and give heed to my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in the last days it shall be, God says,that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,and your young men shall see visions,and your old men shall dream dreams;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>even on my servants, both men and women,I will pour out my Spirit in those days,and they shall prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will show wonders in heaven aboveand signs on the earth below,blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun will be turned into darknessand the moon into blood,before the great and glorious day        of the Lord shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall be that everyonewho calls on the name of the Lordwill be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>this man, delivered over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But God raised him up, having loosed the agony of death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says concerning him, I saw the Lord always before me;for he is at my right hand, so that I will not be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced;moreover my flesh also will live in hope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because you will not abandon my soul to hades,nor let your Holy One see decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have made known to me the ways of life;you will make me full of gladness with your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Brethren, I may say to you confidently of the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And so, because he was a prophet, and knew that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he looked ahead and spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to hades,nor did his flesh see decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus God raised up again, and of that we are all witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not ascend into heaven, but he says himself: The Lord said to my Lord,»Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>until I make your enemies a footstoolfor your feet.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, »Brethren, what shall we do?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter said to them, »Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, for all whom the Lord our God will call to himself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he testified with many other words and exhorted them, saying, »Save yourselves from this perverse generation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Everyone was filled with awe; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all who believed were together and had all things in common;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as anyone had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they ate together with glad and sincere hearts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
