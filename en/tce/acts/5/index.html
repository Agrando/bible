And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? How is it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear came upon all who heard of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The young men arose and wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said to her, »Tell me whether you sold the land for such and such a price.« And she said, »Yes, that was the price.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Peter said to her, »How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Immediately she fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all the more believers in the Lord, multitudes of men and women, were constantly added to their number,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and pallets, so that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the high priest rose up and all who were with him, that is, the party of the Sadducees, and they were filled with jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, and brought them out, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Go, stand and speak to the people in the temple the whole message of this Life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they heard this, they entered into the temple about daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest and his associates came, they called the Council together, even all the Senate of the sons of Israel, and sent orders to the prison house for them to be brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, and they returned and reported back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»We found the prison securely locked, and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed about them, wondering what would come of this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And someone came and told them, »Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the captain went along with the officers and brought them back without violence, for they were afraid of the people, that they might be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When they had brought them, they set them before the council. The high priest questioned them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, »We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name, and yet, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man's blood upon us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter and the apostles answered, »We must obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers raised Jesuswhom you had killed by hanging him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>God exalted him to his own right hand as Prince and Savior, to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, held in honor by all the people, stood up and ordered the men to be put outside for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, »Men of Israel, take care what you propose to do with these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men joined him. But he was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him; he too perished, and all those who followed him were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or action is of men, it will fail;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them; or else you may even be found fighting against God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they took his advice, and they called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
