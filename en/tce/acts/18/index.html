He went to see them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them, and they worked, for by trade they were tentmakers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And every Sabbath he was reasoning in the synagogue, and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook out his garments and said to them, »Your blood be on your own heads! I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, »Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for I am with you, and no man will attack you to harm you, for I have many people in this city.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack upon Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, »This man is persuading men to worship God contrary to the law.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, »If it were a matter of wrong or of vicious crime, O Jews, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; I refuse to be a judge of these things.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them from the judgment seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the judgment seat. But Gallio paid no attention to this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>After this Paul stayed many days longer, and then took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and with him were Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchrea he had his hair cut, for he had taken a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came to Ephesus, and he left them there. Now he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he declined;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but on taking leave of them he said, »I will return to you if God wills,« and he set sail from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, well versed in the scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he began to speak out boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he wanted to go across to Achaia, the brethren encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he had arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
