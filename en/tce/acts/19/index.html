There he found some disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said to them, »Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?« And they said, »No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said, »Into what then were you baptized?« They said, »Into John's baptism.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Paul said, »John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There were about twelve men in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, arguing and persuading about the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some were stubborn and disbelieved, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them, and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This took place for two years, so that all who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God did extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick, and diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But also some of the Jewish exorcists, who went from place to place, attempted to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, »I adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the evil spirit answered them, »Jesus I know, and I know about Paul, but who are you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered all of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who lived in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Many also of those who believed now came, confessing and disclosing their practices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a number of those who practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now after these things were finished, Paul purposed in the spirit to go to Jerusalem after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, »After I have been there, I must also see Rome.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>About that time there arose no small disturbance concerning the Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These he gathered together, with the workmen of similar trades, and said, »Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people, saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Not only is there danger that this trade of ours fall into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship will even be dethroned from her magnificence.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When they heard this, they were enraged and began crying out, »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Paul wanted to go in among the crowd, but the disciples would not let him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Some of the Asiarchs also, who were friends of his, sent to him and begged him not to venture into the theater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now some were shouting one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and most of the people did not know why they had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, since the Jews had put him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, wishing to make a defense to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all with one voice shouted, »Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, »Men of Ephesus, what man is there after all who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of the image which fell down from heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore, since these facts are undeniable, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if you want anything further, it shall be settled in the lawful assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As it is, we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of today's events. In that case we would not be able to account for this commotion, since there is no reason for it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
