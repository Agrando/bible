They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they sent the following letter with them: »The apostles and the brethren who are elders, to the brethren in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia who are from the Gentiles, greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Since we have heard that some persons from us have disturbed you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication. If you keep yourselves free from these, you will do well. Farewell.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch; and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they read it, they rejoiced at its encouragement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged the brethren with many words and strengthened them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after they had spent some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brethren to those who had sent them.</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="34">34</a></span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>After some days Paul said to Barnabas, »Let us return and visit the brethren in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Barnabas wanted to take John, also called Mark, with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul kept insisting that they should not take along one who had deserted them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>There arose such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another, and Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Paul chose Silas and left, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
