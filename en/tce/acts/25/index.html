I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If, then, I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if none of the charges brought against me is true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then when Festus had conferred with his council, he answered, »You have appealed to Caesar, to Caesar you shall go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when a few days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and paid their respects to Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>While they were spending many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, »There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for sentence against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I answered them that it is not the custom of the Romans to hand over any man before the accused meets his accusers face to face and has an opportunity to make his defense against the charges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When therefore they came together here, I did not delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When the accusers stood up, they did not charge him of such crimes as I had expected,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but they simply had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man, Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Being at a loss how to investigate such matters, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there stand trial on these matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in custody until I could send him to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Agrippa said to Festus, »I also would like to hear the man myself.« »Tomorrow,« he said, »you shall hear him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the prominent men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Festus said, »King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I found that he had done nothing deserving of death; and as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But I have nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you all and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken place, I may have something to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
