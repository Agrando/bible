Some said, »What would this idle babbler wish to say?« Others, »He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,«because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, »May we know what this new teaching is which you present?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are bringing some strange things to our ears; so we want to know what these things mean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time in nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Paul stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus and said: »Men of Athens, I see that in every way you are very religious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who made the world and everything in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he made from one man every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For in him we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets have said, We are his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed, and of this he has given proof to all men by raising him from the dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered, but others said, »We want to hear you again on this subject.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Paul went out from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
