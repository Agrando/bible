Kill and eat!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, »No, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the voice came to him again a second time, »What God has cleansed, you must not call common.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This happened three times, and immediately the thing was taken up to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, appeared at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They called out, asking whether Simon who was known as Peter was staying there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While Peter was reflecting on the vision, the Spirit said to him, »Behold, three men are looking for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But get up, go downstairs and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them myself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter went down to the men and said, »Behold, I am the one you are looking for; what is the reason you have come?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said, »Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house, and to hear what you have to say.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he invited them in to be his guests. The next day he rose and went off with them, and some of the brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>On the following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter raised him up, saying, »Stand up; I too am just a man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As he talked with him, he went in and found many people assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to them, »You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with a foreigner or to visit him; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So when I was sent for, I came without raising any objection. I ask then why you sent for me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Cornelius said, »Four days ago to this hour, I was praying in my house during the ninth hour; and behold, a man stood before me in shining garments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So I sent for you immediately, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And opening his mouth, Peter said: »I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is welcome to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You know the word which he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You know what has happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>We are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Of him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>All the circumcised believers who came with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Can anyone refuse the water for these people to be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay on for a few days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
