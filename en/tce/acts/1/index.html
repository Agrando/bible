This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in just the same way as you have watched him go into heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying; Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All these with one mind devoted themselves to prayer, along with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days Peter stood up among the brethren (the company of persons was in all about a hundred and twenty), and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Brethren, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David, concerning Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was counted among us and received his share in this ministry.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his homestead be made desolate,and let there be no one to dwell in it; and, let another man take his office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore it is necessary that of the men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from usone of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was also called Justus), and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed and said, »You, Lord, who know the hearts of all men, show which one of these two you have chosen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside, to go to his own place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell to Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
