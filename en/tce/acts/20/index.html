And as Paul talked on and on, he was overcome by sleep and fell down from the third story and was picked up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Paul went down and fell on him, and after embracing him, he said, »Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with them a long while until daybreak, and then left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They took away the boy alive, and were greatly comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there; for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Sailing from there, we arrived the following day opposite Chios; and the next day we crossed over to Samos; and the day after that we came to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to him the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came to him, he said to them: »You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day that I set foot in Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials which came upon me through the plots of the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you publicly and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, behold, bound in the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I do not consider my life of any account nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, behold, I know that all of you among whom I have gone about preaching the kingdom will see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with the blood of his Own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and from among your own selves will arise men speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night and day to admonish each one with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have coveted no one's silver or gold or clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to the men who were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: It is more blessed to give than to receive.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When he had said this, he knelt down and prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all wept and embraced Paul and kissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>grieving most of all over the word which he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
