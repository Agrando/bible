It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said to them, »It is I; do not be afraid.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>However, boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, »Rabbi, when did you come here?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they said to him, »What must we do, to be doing the works of God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered them, »This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they said to him, »What sign will you perform then, that we may see it and believe you? What work will you do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus then said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then they said to him, »Lord, give us this bread always.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus said to them, »I am the bread of life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will by no means cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jews then began to murmur about him, because he said, »I am the bread which came down from heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They said, »Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered them, »Do not murmur among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that any one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying, »How can this man give us his flesh to eat?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on me will live because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live for ever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This he said in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, »This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples complained about this, he said to them, »Does this offend you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you who do not believe.« For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And he said, »This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>From this time many of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then Jesus said to the twelve, »Do you also want to go away?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Simon Peter answered him, »Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And we believe, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them, »Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who was to betray him, though one of the twelve.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
