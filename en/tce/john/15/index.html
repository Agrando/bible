As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from me you can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If anyone does not abide in me, he is like a branch that is cast away and withers; and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you; abide in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are my friends if you do what I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This I command you, that you love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I said to you, A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will keep yours also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But all this they will do to you for my name's sake, because they do not know him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who hates me hates my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But this is to fulfill the word that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»But when the Counselor comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, he will testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you also will bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
