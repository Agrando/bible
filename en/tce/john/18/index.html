So, if you seek me, let these men go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This happened so that the words which he had spoken would be fulfilled, »Of those whom you gave me I have lost none.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priests servant, and cut off his right ear. The servants name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus said to Peter, »Put your sword into its sheath; shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the detachment of soldiers and their captain and the officers of the Jews arrested Jesus and bound him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they led him to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was Caiaphas who had advised the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter stood at the door outside. Then the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the girl who kept the door, and brought Peter in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the girl who kept the door said to Peter, »You are not also one of this mans disciples, are you?« He said, »I am not.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves. Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The high priest then questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered him, »I have spoken openly to the world. I always taught in synagogues and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and I have said nothing in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them. They know what I said.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, »Is that the way you answer the high priest?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him, »If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now Simon Peter stood warming himself. Therefore they said to him, »You are not also one of his disciples, are you?« He denied it and said, »I am not.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, »Did I not see you in the garden with him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peter again denied it; and at once a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they did not enter the Praetorium themselves, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So Pilate went out to them and said, »What accusation do you bring against this man?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered him, »If he were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pilate said to them, »Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.« The Jews said to him, »It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken would be fulfilled, showing by what death he was going to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to him, »Are you the King of the Jews?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered, »Do you say this on your own, or did others say it to you about me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answered, »Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered, »My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now my kingship is not from here.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate said to him, »You are a king then?« Jesus answered, »You say what I ama king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate said to him, »What is truth?« After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, »I find no crime in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then they all cried again, »Not this man, but Barabbas!« Now Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
