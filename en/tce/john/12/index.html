And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief; and as he had the money box, he used to take what was put into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said, »Let her alone, she has kept this for the day of my burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now a great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus also to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The next day a great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying, »Hosanna!Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!The King of Israel!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Fear not, daughter of Zion;behold, your King is coming,sitting on a donkey's colt.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For this reason the people went to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Pharisees then said to one another, »You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, The world has gone after him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, »Sir, we wish to see Jesus.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip went and told Andrew; and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered them, »The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, him my Father will honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? No, for this purpose I came to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify your name.« Then a voice came from heaven, »I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, »An angel has spoken to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered, »This voice has come for your sake, not for mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said this to show by what death he was to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The crowd answered him, »We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how can you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus said to them, »A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.« When Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: »Lord, who has believed our report?And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»He has blinded their eyesand hardened their hearts,lest they should see with their eyes,and understand with their hearts and turn,so that I should heal them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then Jesus cried out and said, »He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he who sees me sees him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me should not remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will condemn him on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me gave me a command, what to say and what to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his command is eternal life. Whatever I say, therefore, I say just as the Father has told me.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
