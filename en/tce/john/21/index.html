And after this he said to him, »Follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved, who had leaned on his breast at the supper and had said, »Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, »Lord, what about this man?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the saying spread among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple who testifies to these things, and who wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But there are also many other things which Jesus did. If every one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
