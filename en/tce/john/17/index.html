Glorify your Son, that your Son also may glorify you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>as you have given him authority over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to all those you have given him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have glorified you on the earth, having finished the work which you have given me to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now, Father, glorify me in your own presence with the glory which I had with you before the world was made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I have manifested your name to the men whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours; you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I have given them the words which you have given me, and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and they have believed that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I pray for them. I am not praying for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name  the name you gave me  that they may be one, even as we are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While I was with them, I kept them in your name  the name you gave me. I have guarded them, and none of them is lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But now I am coming to you, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have given them your word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I do not pray that you should take them out of the world, but that you should keep them from the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in me through their word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that they all may be one, as you, Father, are in me, and I in you; that they also may be in us, that the world may believe that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the glory which you gave me I have given them, that they may be one just as we are one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I in them, and you in me; that they may become perfectly one, and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them even as you have loved me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me may be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>O righteous Father, the world has not known you, but I have known you; and these know that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have made known to them your name, and will make it known, that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
