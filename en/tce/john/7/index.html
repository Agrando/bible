If you do these things, show yourself to the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even his brothers did not believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to them, »My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Having said this, he remained in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, »Where is he?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much complaining among the people about him. Some said, »He is a good man«; others said, »No, on the contrary, he deceives the people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews marveled, saying, »How did this man get such learning, having never studied?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them, »My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone is willing to do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of the One who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered, »You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered them, »I did one deed, and you all marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, »Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Here he is, speaking publicly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that he is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus cried out, as he taught in the temple, »You know me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come on my own, but he who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know him, for I am from him, and he sent me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they sought to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And many of the people believed in him, and they said, »When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus said to them, »I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You will seek me, and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews said to one another, »Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What does he mean when he said, You will seek me and you will not find me, and, Where I am you cannot come?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, »If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When they heard these words, some of the people said, »Surely this is the prophet.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, »This is the Christ.« But some said, »Will the Christ come from Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division among the people because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Some of them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, »Why did you not bring him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, »No man ever spoke like this man!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees answered them, »Are you deceived, you also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before, and who was one of them, said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he is doing?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They replied, »Are you from Galilee, too? Search and look, and you will find that no prophet is to rise out of Galilee.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then each went to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
