If anyone enters by me, he will be saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he who is a hireling and not the shepherd, who does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches the sheep and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep, and my sheep know me</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this reason my Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from my Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them said, »He has a demon, and is mad. Why listen to him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, »These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Jesus was in the temple, walking in Solomon's Porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, »How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, »I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one shall snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews took up stones again to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, »I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, »For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, »Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not do the works of my father, do not believe me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped from their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to him and they said, »John performed no sign, but all that John said about this man was true.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
