My hour has not yet come.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother said to the servants, »Do whatever he tells you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now six stone jars were standing there, according to the manner for purification of the Jews, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to them, »Fill the jars with water.« And they filled them up to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, »Now draw some out, and take it to the master of the feast.« So they took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to him, »Every man sets out the good wine first; and when the guests have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers at their business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he made a whip of cords, and drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said to those who sold doves, »Take these things away! You shall not make my Father's house a house of merchandise!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His disciples remembered that it was written, »Zeal for your house will consume me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Jews said to him, »What sign do you show to us, since you do this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered them, »Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jews then said, »It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he was speaking of the temple of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he had no need for anyone to bear witness of man, for he knew what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
