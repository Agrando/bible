If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things he said, and after that he said to them, »Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to wake him up.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His disciples said, »Lord, if he sleeps, he will recover.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So then Jesus told them plainly, »Lazarus is dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, »Let us also go, that we may die with him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So when Jesus came, he found that he had already been in the tomb four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary sat in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Martha said to Jesus, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to her, »Your brother will rise again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha said to him, »I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her, »I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said to him, »Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when she had said this, she went her way and called Mary her sister, saying, »The Teacher is here and is calling for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, »Where have you laid him?« They said to him, »Lord, come and see.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the Jews said, »See how he loved him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But some of them said, »Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, »Take away the stone.« Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, »Lord, by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been dead four days.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said to her, »Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, »Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing by, that they may believe that you sent me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, »Lazarus, come out!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with grave clothes, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, »Unbind him, and let him go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many of the Jews therefore, who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, »What are we to do? For this man performs many signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, »You know nothing at all!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not for that nation only, but also that he would gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So from that day on they plotted to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, »What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, so that they might arrest him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
