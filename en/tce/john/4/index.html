It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, »Give me a drink.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the woman of Samaria said to him, »How is it that you, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?« For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered her, »If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman said to him, »Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered her, »Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. The water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman said to him, »Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, »Go, call your husband, and come here.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered, »I have no husband.« Jesus said to her, »You are right in saying, I have no husband;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said to him, »Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to her, »Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman said to him, »I know that Messiah is coming« (who is called Christ). »When he comes, he will tell us all things.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to her, »I who speak to you am he.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Just then his disciples came. And they marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, »What do you wish?« or, »Why are you talking with her?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and said to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They went out of the city and came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Meanwhile his disciples urged him, saying, »Rabbi, eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he said to them, »I have food to eat of which you do not know.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So the disciples said to one another, »Has any one brought him food?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, »My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say, There are yet four months and then comes the harvest? Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields! They are already white for harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For here the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, »He told me all that I ever did.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed because of his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They said to the woman, »We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man is indeed the Savior of the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After the two days he departed to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said to him, »Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The official said to him, »Sir, come down before my child dies.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, »Go; your son will live.« The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>So he inquired of them the hour when his son got better, and they said to him, »Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus had said to him, »Your son will live.« And he himself believed, and all his household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
