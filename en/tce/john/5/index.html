Now that day was the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the Jews said to the man who was cured, »It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he answered them, »The man who made me well said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They asked him, »Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed, and walk?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, »See, you are well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse may happen to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus answered them, »My Father is working still, and I am working.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, the Son also does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and come forth  those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»If I bear witness of myself, my testimony is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another who bears witness of me, and I know that the testimony which he bears of me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a time in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I am doing, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father who sent me has himself testified of me. You have never heard his voice, nor seen his form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You search the Scriptures, because in them you think that you have eternal life; and these are they that testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»I do not receive glory from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
