And when they had set her in the midst,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>they said to him, »Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They said this to test him, that they might have something of which to accuse him. But Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, »Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then those who heard it went away one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last, and Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus straightened up and said to her, »Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She said, »No one, Lord.« And Jesus said, »Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, »I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Pharisees then said to him, »You are bearing witness of yourself; your testimony is not true.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered, »Even if I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And yet if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In your own law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am One who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they said to him, »Where is your Father?« Jesus answered, »You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus said to them again, »I am going away, and you will seek me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the Jews said, »Will he kill himself, since he says, Where I go you cannot come?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, »You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I told to you that you would die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said to him, »Who are you?« Jesus said to them, »Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Jesus said, »When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak just what the Father taught me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he spoke these words, many believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, »If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered him, »We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, You will be made free?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And a slave does not continue in the house forever, but a son continues forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that you are Abraham's descendants, yet you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered him, »Abraham is our father.« Jesus said to them, »If you were Abraham's children, you would do the things Abraham did,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You do the deeds of your father.« They said to him, »We were not born of fornication; we have one Father  God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, »If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I have not come of my own accord, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you are not able to hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You are of your father the devil, and you want to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason you do not hear them is that you are not of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Jews answered him, »Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, »I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word he will never see death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jews said to him, »Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you claim to be?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, »If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not know him, I would be a liar like you; but I do know him and keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Jews then said to him, »You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
