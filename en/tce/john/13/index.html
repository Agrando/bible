And Peter said to him, »Lord, are you going to wash my feet?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered him, »You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said to him, »You shall never wash my feet.« Jesus answered him, »If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said to him, »Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to him, »He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not every one of you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, »You are not all clean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and returned to his place, he said to them, »Do you know what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than he who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am not speaking of you all. I know whom I have chosen; but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, he who ate my bread has lifted up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does take place, you may believe that I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who receives anyone I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had said this, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, »Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was leaning close to the breast of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter motioned to him and said, »Ask who it is of whom he speaks.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then, leaning back on the breast of Jesus, he said to him, »Lord, who is it?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered, »It is he to whom I shall give this piece of bread when I have dipped it.« And having dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then after the bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, »What you are going to do, do quickly.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But no one at the table knew why he said this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, »Buy what we need for the feast«; or, that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Having received the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When he had gone out, Jesus said, »Now is the Son of Man glorified, and in him God is glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will seek me; and as I said to the Jews, Where I am going, you cannot come, so now I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said to him, »Lord, where are you going?« Jesus answered, »Where I am going you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow afterward.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said to him, »Lord, why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered, »Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster will not crow, till you have denied me three times.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
