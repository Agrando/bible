For if I do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he comes, he will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>of sin, because they do not believe in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you see me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth; for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak; and he will tell you things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me, for he will take of what is mine and declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All that the Father has is mine. Therefore I said that he will take of what is mine and declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»A little while, and you will see me no more; again a little while, and you will see me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then some of his disciples said to one another, »What is this that he says to us, A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while, and you will see me; and, because I go to the Father?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said, »What does he mean by a little while? We do not know what he is saying.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him, so he said to them, »Are you asking yourselves about what I meant when I said, A little while, and you will not see me; and again a little while, and you will see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When a woman is in labor she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but as soon as she gives birth to the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child has been born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I have said this to you in figurative language; but the time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day you will ask in my name. And I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and going to the Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said, »See, now you are speaking plainly, and not using a figure of speech!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we are sure that you know all things, and have no need for anyone to question you. By this we believe that you came from God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, »Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Indeed the hour is coming, yes, has now come, when you will be scattered, each to his own, and will leave me alone. And yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage! I have overcome the world.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
