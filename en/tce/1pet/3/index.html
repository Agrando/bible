And you are her children if you do what is right and are not frightened by any fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Husbands, in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives, and treat them with honor as the weaker partner, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, so that your prayers will not be hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, all of you, live in harmony with one another; be sympathetic, love as brothers, be compassionate and humble in spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not return evil for evil or insult for insult, but give a blessing instead; for to this you were called, that you may inherit a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, »He who would love lifeand see good daysmust keep his tongue from eviland his lips from speaking deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He must turn away from evil and do good;he must seek peace and pursue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteousand his ears are open to their prayer,but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are blessed. Do not fear their intimidation, and do not be troubled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but in your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness and respect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and keep a clear conscience, so that, when you are abused, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better to suffer for doing right, if that should be God's will, than for doing wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who formerly did not obey, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And corresponding to that, baptism now saves younot the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good consciencethrough the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels and authorities and powers subject to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
