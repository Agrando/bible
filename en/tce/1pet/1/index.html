In his great mercy he has caused us to be born again into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, kept in heaven for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who are protected by God's power through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have to suffer various trials,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though you have not seen him, you love him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an inexpressible and glorious joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>as you obtain the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As to this salvation, the prophets who prophesied of the grace that would come to you inquired and searched carefully,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you, in these things which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaventhings into which angels long to look.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober in spirit, set your hope fully on the grace to be given you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As obedient children, do not be conformed to the former lusts which were yours in your ignorance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but as he who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because it is written, »You shall be holy, for I am holy.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you address as Father the One who impartially judges according to each one's work, conduct yourselves in fear during the time of your exile on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You know that you were redeemed from the futile way of life inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He was destined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Through him you have confidence in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Since you have purified your souls by obedience to the truth for a sincere love of the brethren, love one another earnestly from the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For you have been born again, not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, »All flesh is like grass,and all its glory like the flower of grass.The grass withers,and the flower falls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but the word of the Lord stands forever.« And this is the word which was preached to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
