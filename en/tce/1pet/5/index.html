Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for »God opposes the proud,but gives grace to the humble.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Cast all your anxiety on him, because he cares for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be sober, be alert. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren throughout the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, establish, and strengthen you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>With the help of Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting you and testifying that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you her greetings, and so does my son Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Greet one another with a kiss of love.
