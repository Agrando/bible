But if when you do right and suffer for it you patiently endure, you have favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»He committed no sin,and no deceit was found in his mouth;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>when he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he uttered no threats, but he trusted himself to him who judges justly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sin and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
