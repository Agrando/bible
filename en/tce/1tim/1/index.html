These promote controversies rather than the divine trainingwhich is by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For some men have wandered away from these things and turned aside to fruitless discussion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>wanting to be teachers of the Law, even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But we know that the Law is good, if one uses it lawfully,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>realizing the fact that law is not made for a righteous person, but for those who are lawless and rebellious, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and immoral men and homosexuals and kidnappers and liars and perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>according to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, with which I have been entrusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, because he considered me faithful, appointing me to his service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor, I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the grace of our Lord was overflowing for me, with the faith and love that are found in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinnersof whom I am the foremost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I received mercy for this reason, so that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience for an example to those who would believe in him for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever.
