Teach and urge these duties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching which accords with godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is conceited and understands nothing; but he has a morbid interest in controversial questions and disputes about words, which produce envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth, who imagine that godliness is a means of gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But godliness with contentment is itself great gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil, and some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you, man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance and gentleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of the faith; take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who made the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>to keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>which he will bring about at the proper timeÂ—he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who alone has immortality and dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with everything to enjoy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, to be generous and ready to share,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that life which is life indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>which some have professed and in so doing have wandered from the faith. Grace be with you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
