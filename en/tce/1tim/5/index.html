And not only do they become idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things they ought not to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their homes, and give the enemy no occasion for reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For some have already turned aside to follow Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, she must assist them, and let not the church be burdened, so that it may assist those who are real widows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the scripture says, »You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain,« and, »The laborer deserves his wages.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I charge you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels, to keep these instructions without partiality, doing nothing out of favoritism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, and do not share in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The sins of some men are obvious, going before them to judgment; for others, their sins appear later.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way, good deeds are obvious, and even those that are not cannot be hidden.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
