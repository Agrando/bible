Will he delay long over them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I tell you that he will bring about justice for them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also he told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you that I am not like other menextortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now they were also bringing infants to him that he might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus called them to him and said, »Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will not enter it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now a certain ruler asked him, »Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Jesus said to him, »Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, »All these I have kept from my youth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When Jesus heard it, he said to him, »One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he heard this, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus looked at him and said, »How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Those who heard it said, »Then who can be saved?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he said, »What is impossible with men is possible with God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter said, »Behold, we have left all and followed you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So he said to them, »Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he took the twelve aside and said to them, »Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written of the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he will be delivered to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They will scourge him and kill him, and on the third day he will rise again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what he was talking about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As he drew near to Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And hearing a multitude going by, he asked what this meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They told him, »Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried out, »Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who led the way rebuked him, telling him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, »Son of David, have mercy on me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Jesus stopped, and commanded him to be brought to him. And when he came near, he asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»What do you want me to do for you?« He said, »Lord, I want to receive my sight.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him, »Receive your sight; your faith has made you well.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he received his sight and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
