And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>he took him up in his arms and blessed God, and said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace,according to your word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for my eyes have seen your salvation</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a light for revelation to the Gentiles,and for glory to your people Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his father and his mother marveled at what was said about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, »Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that will be spoken against</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>(and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, but worshipped with fasting and prayer night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they had performed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the child grew and became strong; he was filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast, according to the custom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when the feast was over, as they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey, and they sought him among their relatives and acquaintances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when they saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, »Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he said to them, »Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father's house?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But they did not understand the saying which he spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them, but his mother kept all these things in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
