So it was, when the demon had gone out, that the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some of them said, »He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the prince of demons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Others, testing him, sought from him a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them: »Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and a house divided against itself falls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? For you say that I cast out demons by Beelzebub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I cast out demons by the finger of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own palace, his goods are in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when one stronger than he attacks him and overpowers him, he takes away his armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return to my house from which I came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he comes, he finds it swept and put in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As he said these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, »Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts that nursed you!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he said, »Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, »This is an evil generation. It seeks a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so also the Son of Man will be to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The queen of the South will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, one greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a secret place or under a basket, but on a stand, that those who come in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is good, your whole body also is full of light. But when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore be careful that the light in you is not darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be completely lighted, as when the bright shining of a lamp gives you light.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>While he was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him; so he went in and sat at table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The Pharisee was surprised to see that he did not first wash before dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the Lord said to him, »Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You foolish ones! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But give for alms those things which are within; and behold, everything is clean for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and neglect justice and the love of God. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Woe to you Pharisees! For you love the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Woe to you! For you are like graves which are not seen, and men walk over them without knowing it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>One of the lawyers answered him, »Teacher, by saying these things you reproach us also.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said, »Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Woe to you! For you build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So you witness that you approve of the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them, and you build their tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore the wisdom of God also said, I will send them prophets and apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it shall be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Woe to you lawyers! For you have taken away the key of knowledge. You did not enter in yourselves, and you hindered those who were entering.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>As he went away from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him hard, and to provoke him to speak of many things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>lying in wait for him, to catch at something he might say.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
