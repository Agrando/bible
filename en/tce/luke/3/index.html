Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the multitudes asked him, »What then shall we do?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he answered them, »He who has two tunics, let him share with him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, »Teacher, what shall we do?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, »Collect no more than is appointed you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Likewise the soldiers asked him, »And what shall we do?« So he said to them, »Rob no one by violence or accuse falsely, and be content with your wages.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As the people were in expectation, and all men questioned in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he were the Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>John answered them all, »I baptize you with water; but one mightier than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His winnowing fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing floor, and to gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And with many other exhortations he preached good news to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the other evil things Herod had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>added this to them all, that he shut up John in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was also baptized. And as he was praying, the heaven was opened</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, »You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now Jesus himself, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Mattatha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>the son of Amminadab, the son of Ram, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel, the son of Cainan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
