And not one of them is forgotten before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he who denies me before men will be denied before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now when they bring you before the synagogues and rulers and authorities, do not worry about how or what you should answer, or what you are to say;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Someone in the crowd said to him, »Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he said to him, »Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, »Take heed, and beware of all covetousness; for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he told them a parable, saying: »The ground of a certain rich man yielded plentifully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he thought to himself, What shall I do, since I have no place to store my crops?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones; and there I will store all my grain and my goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, »Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years; take your ease; eat, drink, and be merry.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said to him, Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose will those things be which you have prepared?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he said to his disciples, »Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat; nor about your body, what you will put on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more value are you than the birds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you by worrying can add a single cubit to his span of life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If you then are not able to do this very little thing, why are you anxious about the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if God so clothes the grass, which today is in the field and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O you of little faith!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And do not seek what you will eat or what you will drink, nor have an anxious mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But seek his kingdom, and these things will be given to you as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell your possessions, and give alms; provide yourselves purses that do not grow old, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Let your waist be girded and your lamps burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and be like men who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding feast, so that they may open to him immediately when he comes and knocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching when he comes. Truly, I say to you that he will gird himself and have them sit at table, and will come and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If he comes in the second watch, or in the third, and finds them so, blessed are those servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But know this, that if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Peter said, »Lord, are you telling this parable to us, or to all?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, »Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his master will set over his household, to give them their portion of food at the proper time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if that servant says to himself, My master is delayed in coming, and begins to beat the menservants and the maidservants, and to eat and drink and get drunk,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him, and at an hour he is not aware of, and he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that servant who knew his master's will, and did not ready himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he who did not know, and committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required; and to whom they entrusted much, of him they will ask the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»I came to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Do you think that I came to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For from now on there will be five in one house divided: three against two, and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They will be divided, father against sonand son against father,mother against daughterand daughter against mother,mother-in-law against daughter-in-lawand daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He also said to the multitudes, »When you see a cloud rising in the west, immediately you say, »A shower is coming; and so it happens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, There will be hot weather; and there is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky; but how is it you do not know how to interpret this present time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>»And why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>As you go with your adversary to the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell you, you will not get out till you have paid the very last copper.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
