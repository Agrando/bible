Cut it down; why should it use up the ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he answered him, Sir, let it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if it bears fruit next year, fine; but if not, you can cut it down.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there was a woman who had had a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years; she was bent over and could not straighten up at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Jesus saw her, he called her forward and said to her, »Woman, you are freed from your infirmity.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and praised God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the people, »There are six days on which work ought to be done; come on those days and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Lord answered him, »You hypocrites! Does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or his donkey from the stall, and lead it away to water it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then ought not this woman, a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound for eighteen years, be loosed on the Sabbath day from this bond?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When he said this, all his adversaries were put to shame; and all the people rejoiced at all the glorious things that were done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he said, »What is the kingdom of God like? And to what shall I compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his garden; and it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air nested in its branches.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again he said, »To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He went on his way through towns and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then one said to him, »Lord, will those who are saved be few?« And he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Strive to enter through the narrow door, for many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When once the owner of the house has risen up and shut the door, you will begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open for us. He will answer you, I do not know where you come from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he will say, I tell you, I do not know where you come from. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And men will come from east and west, and from north and south, and sit at table in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, some are last who will be first, and some are first who will be last.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At that very time some Pharisees came, and said to him, »Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said to them, »Go and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I finish my course.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless I must journey today and tomorrow, and the day following; for it cannot be that a prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you were not willing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Behold, your house is left to you desolate. And I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
