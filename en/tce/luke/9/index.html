Then he took them with him and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when the crowds learned it, they followed him; and he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and healed those who had need of healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the day began to wear away; and the twelve came and said to him, »Send the crowd away, to go to the surrounding villages and country, to lodge and get provisions; for we are here in a deserted place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he said to them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said, »We have no more than five loaves and two fishunless we go and buy food for all these people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For there were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, »Make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they did so, and made them all sit down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They all ate and were satisfied, and they took up twelve baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now it happened that as he was praying alone his disciples were with him; and he asked them, »Who do the crowds say that I am?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they answered, »John the Baptist; but others say Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to them, »But who do you say that I am?« And Peter answered, »The Christ of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he strictly warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>saying, »The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he said to them all, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses or forfeits himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now about eight days after these sayings, he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was altered, and his robe became white and glistening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, two men talked with him, Moses and Elijah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; and when they were fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As the men were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, »Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah«not knowing what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, »This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. But they kept quiet, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a great crowd met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, »Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son, for he is my only child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out; it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and will hardly leave him, bruising him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>While he was coming, the demon threw him and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone was marveling at all that Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But they did not understand this saying, and it was hidden from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And an argument arose among them as to which of them would be the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a little child and set him by him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and said to them, »Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. For he who is least among you all is the one who is great.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now John answered, »Master, we saw a man casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus said to him, »Do not forbid him, for he that is not against you is for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>When the time drew near for him to be received up, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he sent messengers on ahead, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>but the people did not receive him, because his face was set for Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, »Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he turned and rebuked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and they went on to another village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As they were going along the road, a man said to him, »I will follow you wherever you go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And Jesus said to him, »Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>To another he said, »Follow me.« But he said, »Lord, let me first go and bury my father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Jesus said to him, »Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Still another said, »I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say farewell to those at my home.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus said to him, »No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
