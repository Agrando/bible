And he sat down and taught the people from the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, »Put out into the deep, and let down your nets for a catch.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Simon answered, »Master, we toiled all night and caught nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets were breaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, »Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, »Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So when they had brought their boats to land, they left everything and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While he was in one of the cities, a man who was full of leprosy saw Jesus; and he fell on his face and begged him, »Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, »I am willing; be clean.« And immediately the leprosy left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he charged him to tell no one, »But go and show yourself to the priest, and make an offering for your cleansing as a testimony to them, just as Moses commanded.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the report went around concerning him all the more; and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he often withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One day as he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting by, who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present for him to heal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then behold, men brought on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When they could not find a way to bring him in, because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst before Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When he saw their faith he said, »Man, your sins are forgiven you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, »Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answered them, »Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise up and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins«he said to the man who was paralyzed »I say to you, rise, take up your bed and go home.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Immediately he rose up before them, took up what he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, »We have seen strange things today.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After this he went out, and saw a tax collector, named Levi, sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, »Follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he left everything, rose up and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Levi made him a great feast in his house; and there were a great number of tax collectors and others sitting at table with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the Pharisees and their scribes complained against his disciples, saying, »Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jesus answered them, »Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They said to him, »The disciples of John fast often and offer prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours eat and drink.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, »Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He told them a parable also: »No one tears a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old one; if he does, he will tear the new garment, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the new wine will burst the skins and it will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But new wine must be put into new wineskins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And no one after drinking old wine desires the new; for he says, The old is better.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
