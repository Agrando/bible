But while he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion for him, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he was angry and refused to go in. So his father came out and pleaded with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he answered his father, Behold, these many years I have been serving you, and I never disobeyed your command; yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your living with harlots, you killed for him the fatted calf!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
