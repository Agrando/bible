Give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The steward said to himself, What shall I do, since my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have decided what to do, so that people may receive me into their houses when I am put out of the stewardship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he called in each one of his master's debtors, and he said to the first, How much do you owe my master?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. So he said to him, Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill, and write eighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the master commended the dishonest steward because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own generation than the sons of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I tell you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much; and he who is dishonest in a very little is dishonest also in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If then you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will trust you with the true riches?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if you have not been faithful in what is another's, who will give you what is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all this, and they scoffed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, »You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is forcing his way into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one dot of the law to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and feasted sumptuously every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>longing to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the beggar died, and was carried by the angels to Abraham's bosom. The rich man also died and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he called out, Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am in agony in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham said, Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, and Lazarus received evil things; but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to pass from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said,  Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they also come to this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, No, father Abraham; but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if some one should rise from the dead.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
