Remember how he told you while he was still in Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they remembered his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they returned from the tomb and told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them, who told this to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But their words seemed to them like idle tales, and they did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Peter arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen wrappings lying by themselves; and he went away, marveling to himself at what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now behold, that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>While they talked and discussed, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, »What is this conversation which you are exchanging with each other as you walk?« And they stood still, looking sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, »Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to them, »What things?« And they said to him, »The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, it is the third day since all this happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In addition, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and when they did not find his body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said; but him they did not see.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, »O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Did not the Christ have to suffer these things and enter his glory?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As they drew near the village to which they were going, he acted as though he would be going farther,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but they constrained him, saying, »Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.« So he went in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When he was at the table with them, he took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him; and he vanished from their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said to each other, »Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us on the road, while he opened to us the scriptures?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, »The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As they were saying this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, »Peace be with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they were startled and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, »Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. Handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And while they still did not believe for joy, and marveled, he said to them, »Have you anything here to eat?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he took it and ate in their presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he said to them, »These are my words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their minds, so they could understand the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them, »Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and were continually in the temple praising God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
