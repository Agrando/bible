And what will be the sign when they are about to take place?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said: »Take heed that you not are deceived. For many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and, The time is near. Do not go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be terrified; for these things must first take place, but the end will not come immediately.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to them, »Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all this, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. And you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This will turn into an opportunity for you to bear testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore settle it in your minds not to meditate beforehand how you will answer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relatives and friends; and they will put some of you to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You will be hated by all for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But not a hair of your head will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By your endurance you will gain your lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains, let those who are in the city depart, and let not those who are out in the country enter it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For these are days of vengeance, to fulfil all that is written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! For there will be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They will fall by the edge of the sword, and be led captive to all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»There will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roaring of the sea and the waves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men fainting from fear and foreboding of what is coming on the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now when these things begin to take place, look up and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He told them a parable: »Look at the fig tree, and all the trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When they are sprouting, you see and know for yourselves that summer is already near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So you also, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all things take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life, and that Day come on you unexpectedly like a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Watch at all times, and pray always that you may have strength to escape all these things that will take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And every day he was teaching in the temple, but at night he went out to spend the night on the mount called Olivet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And early in the morning all the people came to him in the temple to hear him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
