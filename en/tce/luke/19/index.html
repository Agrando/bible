Because you have been faithful in a very little, be in authority over ten cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the second came, saying, Master, your mina has earned five minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Likewise he said to him, You also be over five cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then another came, saying, Master, here is your mina, which I have kept laid away in a handkerchief;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He said to him, I will judge you out of your own mouth, you wicked servant! You knew that I was a hard man, taking up what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to those who stood by, Take the mina from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said to him, Master, he has ten minas already!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called Olivet, he sent two of the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, »Go into the village opposite you, where as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If any one asks you, Why are you untying it? you shall say to him, The Lord has need of it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So those who were sent went away and found it just as he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, »Why are you untying the colt?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, »The Lord has need of it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought it to Jesus, and they threw their garments on the colt and set Jesus on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he went along, many spread their garments on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And, as he was now drawing near the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying, »Blessed is the Kingwho comes in the name of the Lord!Peace in heavenand glory in the highest!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, »Teacher, rebuke your disciples.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He answered, »I tell you, if these keep silent, the stones would cry out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he drew near and saw the city he wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, »If you had known, even you, this day, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, and surround you and hem you in on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and dash you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave one stone upon another in you; because you did not know the time of your visitation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, »It is written, My house shall be a house of prayer;but you have made it a den of robbers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests the scribes and the leaders of the people sought to destroy him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>but they could not find anything they could do, for all the people hung upon his words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
