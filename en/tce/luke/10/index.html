Do not go from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Whenever you enter a town and they receive you, eat what is set before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Heal the sick there and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But whenever you enter a town and they do not receive you, go into its streets and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet, we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I tell you, it will be more tolerable on that day for Sodom than for that town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven?You shall be brought down to Hades!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»He who hears you hears me, he who rejects you rejects me, and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The seventy returned with joy, saying, »Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to them, »I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I have given you authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy; and nothing shall hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, »I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it was your good pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and the one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, »Blessed are the eyes which see what you see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, »Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to him, »What is written in the law? How do you read?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he answered, »You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to him, »You have answered right; do this, and you will live.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, »And who is my neighbor?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said: »A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him of his clothing, beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him, he had compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; then he set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper and said, Take care of him; and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He said, »The one who showed mercy on him.« And Jesus said to him, »Go and do likewise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now as they went on their way, he entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And she had a sister called Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha was distracted with much serving; and she went to him and said, »Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to help me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But the Lord answered her, »Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but only one thing is needed. And Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
