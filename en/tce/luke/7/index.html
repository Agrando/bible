When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, »Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When Jesus heard this, he marveled at him, and turned and said to the crowd that followed him, »I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Soon afterward, he went to a city called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As he came near the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the city was with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said to her, »Do not weep.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And he said, »Young man, I say to you, arise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The dead man sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Fear seized them all; and they glorified God, saying, »A great prophet has arisen among us;« and »God has visited his people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this report about him spread throughout all Judea and all the surrounding country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the disciples of John told him about all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord, saying, »Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the men had come to him, they said, »John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you the One who is to come, or shall we look for another?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At that very hour he cured many of diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many that were blind he gave sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He answered them, »Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have the good news preached to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And blessed is he who is not offended because of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: »What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>What then did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in kings' courts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I tell you, among those born of women there is no one greater than John; yet the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(And when they heard him, all the people, even the tax collectors, justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the purpose of God for themselves, not having been baptized by him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»To what then shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another: We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;we sang a dirge, and you did not weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, Behold, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But wisdom is justified by all her children.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went to the Pharisee's house, and reclined at the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that Jesus was reclining at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of perfume,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and as she stood behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, »If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus answered him, »Simon, I have something to say to you.« And he said, »Teacher, say it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»A certain creditor had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When they had nothing with which to pay him back, he freely forgave them both. Now which of them will love him more?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answered, »I suppose the one to whom he forgave more.« And he said to him, »You have judged rightly.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, »Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You gave me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss my feet from the time I came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, »Your sins are forgiven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then those who reclined at the table with him began to say among themselves, »Who is this who even forgives sins?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He said to the woman, »Your faith has saved you; go in peace.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
