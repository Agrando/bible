He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mothers womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Zechariah said to the angel, »How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel answered him, »I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he made signs to them and remained speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when his time of service was completed, he went to his home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she hid herself, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Thus the Lord has done to me, in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgins name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The angel went to her and said, »Hail, O highly favored one, the Lord is with you!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But she was greatly troubled at his saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said to her, »Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Mary said to the angel, »How can this be, since I am a virgin?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answered her, »The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For with God nothing will be impossible.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Mary said, »Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.« And the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And she exclaimed with a loud voice, »Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For behold, as soon as the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»My soul magnifies the Lord,and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>for he has regarded the lowly state of his servant;for behold, henceforth all generationswill call me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For he who is mighty has done great things for me,and holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his mercy is on those who fear himfrom generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He has shown strength with his arm;he has scattered the proudin the imagination of their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He has put down the mighty from their thrones,and exalted the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He has filled the hungry with good things,and the rich he has sent empty away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He has helped his servant Israel,in remembrance of his mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>as he spoke to our fathers,to Abraham and to his seed forever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now the time came for Elizabeth to be delivered, and she gave birth to a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they would have named him Zechariah after his father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>but his mother said, »No; he shall be called John.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>They said to her, »There is no one among your relatives who is called by that name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he would have him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« And they all marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came on all their neighbors. And all these things were discussed throughout all the hill country of Judea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>and all who heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, »What then will this child be?« For the hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Now his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>»Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,for he has visited and redeemed his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and has raised up a horn of salvation for usin the house of his servant David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>that we should be saved from our enemiesand from the hand of all who hate us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>To perform the mercy promised to our fathersand to remember his holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>the oath which he swore to our father Abraham:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>to grant us that we,being delivered from the hand of our enemies,might serve him without fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>in holiness and righteousness before himall the days of our life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High;for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>to give knowledge of salvation to his peoplein the forgiveness of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>through the tender mercy of our God,with which the sunrise from on high will visit us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>to give light to those who sit in darknessand in the shadow of death,to guide our feet into the way of peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew and became strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness till the day of his manifestation to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
