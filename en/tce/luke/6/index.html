and from them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, whom he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip, and Bartholomew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Matthew, and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came down with them and stood on a level place with a crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and be healed of their diseases,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the crowd sought to touch him, for power came from him and healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said: »Blessed are you poor,for yours is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed are you who hunger now,for you shall be satisfied.Blessed are you who weep now,for you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed are you when men hate you, and when they exclude you and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But woe to you who are rich,for you have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you who are full now,for you shall hunger.Woe to you who laugh now,for you shall mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for so did their fathers to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»But I say to you who hear: love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to everyone who asks of you, and from him who takes away your goods do not ask them back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you wish that men would do to you, do so to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive back, what credit is that to you? For even sinners lend to sinners, to receive as much back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies, do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For he is kind to the ungrateful and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Judge not, and you will not be judged. Condemn not, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it will be given to you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be put into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He also told them a parable: »Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>A disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not notice the plank in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Or how can you say to your brother, Brother, let me remove the speck that is in your eye, when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First take the plank from out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck that is in your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For each tree is known by its own fruit. For men do not gather figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a bramble bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Why do you call me, Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it was well built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
