In those days he ate nothing, and when they had ended, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the devil said to him, »If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus answered him, »It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the devil took him up to a high place, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to him, »To you I will give all this authority and their glory; for it has been delivered to me, and I give it to whom I will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you, then, will worship me, it shall all be yours.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus answered him, »It is written, You shall worship the Lord your God,and him only shall you serve.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He took him to Jerusalem, set him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, »If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for it is written: He will give his angels charge of you,to guard you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and, In their hands they will bear you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus answered him, »It is said, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news of him went out through all the surrounding country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. And he opened the book, and found the place where it was written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,because he has anointed meto preach the good news to the poor.He has sent me to proclaim release to the captivesand recovery of sight to the blind,to set at liberty those who are oppressed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he began to say to them, »Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all spoke well of him, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth; and they said, »Is not this Joseph's son?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, »Surely you will quote this proverb to me: Physician, heal yourself! Do here also in your own country what we have heard that you did in Capernaum.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he said, »Truly, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I tell you truly, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine throughout all the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but Elijah was sent to none of them except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha; and not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When they heard this, all in the synagogue were filled with wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they rose up and cast him out of the city, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, that they might throw him down the cliff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But passing through the midst of them, he went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and he was teaching them on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonished at his teaching, for his word was with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Ha! What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, »Be quiet, and come out of him!« And when the demon had thrown him down in the midst, he came out of him without doing him any harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they were all amazed and said to one another, »What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the report about him went out into every place in the surrounding region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he arose and left the synagogue, and entered Simon's house. Now Simons mother-in-law was ill with a high fever, and they made request of him on her behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she rose and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And demons also came out of many, crying, »You are the Son of God!« But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Now when it was day, he departed and went into a deserted place. And the people sought him and came to him, and tried to keep him from leaving them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but he said to them, »I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because I was sent for this purpose.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
