And behold, having examined him in your presence, I have found no guilt in this man concerning those charges which you make against him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Behold, nothing deserving death has been done by him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will therefore chastise him and release him.«</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="17">17</a></span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they all cried out together, »Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed to them again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they shouted, »Crucify him, crucify him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he said to them the third time, »Why, what evil has he done? I have found in him no crime deserving death. I will therefore chastise him and release him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that he be crucified. And their voices prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Pilate gave sentence that their demand should be granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, the one they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a great multitude of the people followed him, and women who also mourned and lamented him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus turning to them said, »Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For behold, the days are coming when they will say, Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they will begin to say to the mountains,Fall on us!and to the hills,Cover us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if they do these things when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Two others, criminals, were also led with him to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they came to the place called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jesus said, »Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.« And they divided his garments and cast lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the people stood watching; but even the rulers sneered at him, saying, »He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him wine vinegar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, »If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There was also an inscription written over him: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>One of the criminals who were hanged there hurled insults at him, saying, »Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other rebuked him, saying, »Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then he said, »Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said to him, »Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It was now about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>for the sun was darkened; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, said, »Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.« And having said this, he breathed his last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he praised God, and said, »Certainly this was a righteous man!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When all the multitudes who had gathered to witness this sight saw what had taken place, they beat their breasts, and returned home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>who had not consented to their decision and deed. He came from of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then he took it down and wrapped it in linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb that was hewn out of the rock, where no one had ever yet been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The women who had come with him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
