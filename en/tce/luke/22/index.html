Is it not the one who sits at the table? But I am among you as One who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You are those who have continued with me in my trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I bestow on you a kingdom, just as my Father bestowed one on me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail; and when you have turned again, strengthen your brethren.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he said to him, »Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He said, »I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day before you deny three times that you know me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, »When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?« They said, »Nothing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said to them, »But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag; and let him who has no sword sell his robe and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I tell you that this scripture must be fulfilled in me, And he was numbered with transgressors; for what is written about me has its fulfillment.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They said, »Look, Lord, here are two swords.« And he said to them, »It is enough.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He came out, and went to the Mount of Olives, as was his custom, and his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When he came to the place, he said to them, »Pray that you may not enter into temptation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he withdrew from them about a stones throw, and knelt down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>An angel appeared to him from heaven, and strengthened him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When he rose from prayer, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said to them, »Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he was still speaking, a crowd came, and the man who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>but Jesus said to him, »Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When those around him saw what was going to happen, they said, »Lord, shall we strike with the sword?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus answered, »No more of this!« And he touched his ear and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, officers of the temple, and the elders who had come to him, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priests house. Peter followed at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, looked at him, and said, »This man also was with him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied it, saying, »Woman, I do not know him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And a little later some one else saw him and said, »You also are of them.« But Peter said, »Man, I am not!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then after about an hour had passed, another insisted, saying, »Certainly this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But Peter said, »Man, I do not know what you are saying!« Immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, »Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he went out and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Now the men who were holding Jesus mocked him and beat him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>They blindfolded him and asked him, »Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And they spoke many other things against him, blaspheming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>As soon as it was day, the council of the elders of the people came together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away to their council chamber, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>»If you are the Christ, tell us.« But he said to them, »If I tell you, you will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And if I ask you, you will not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>They all said, »Are you the Son of God, then?« He said to them, »You said what I am.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, »What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
