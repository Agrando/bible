And the twelve were with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had come out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod's steward, and Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when a great crowd came together and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Some fell on the rock; and as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But others fell on good soil, sprang up, and yielded a crop a hundredfold.« When he had said this he called out, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When his disciples asked him what this parable meant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he said, »To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others it is given in parables, so that Seeing they may not see,and hearing they may not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The ones along the path are those who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, that they may not believe and be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy; but these have no root, they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the ones that fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the ones that fell on the good soil are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, that those who enter may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For nothing is secret that will not be revealed, nor anything hidden that will not be known and come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, to him more will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it was told him, »Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he said to them, »My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side of the lake.« So they set out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water, and were in danger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they went and woke him, saying, »Master, Master, we are perishing!« Then he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; and they ceased, and there was a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said to them, »Where is your faith?« And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, »Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he lived not in a house but in the tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, »What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him, and he was kept under guard, bound with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus asked him, »What is your name?« And he said, »Legion«; because many demons had entered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they begged him repeatedly not to command them to go into the Abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now a large herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside; and they begged him to let them enter them. So he gave them permission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the demons came out of the man and entered the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When those tending the pigs saw what had happened, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Those who had seen it told them how he who had been demon-possessed was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Return to your home, and tell how much God has done for you.« And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And behold, there came a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue; and he fell at Jesus' feet and begged him to come to his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went, the people pressed round him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years and could not be healed by anyone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>came up behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; and immediately her flow of blood stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jesus said, »Who touched me?« When all denied it, Peter said, »Master, the multitudes surround you and press upon you!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But Jesus said, »Someone touched me; for I know that power has gone out from me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, »Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While he was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house and said, »Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the Teacher any more.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus on hearing this answered him, »Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be well.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>When he came into the house he permitted no one to go in with him except Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the girl.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Now all were wailing and mourning for her; but he said, »Do not weep; she is not dead, but sleeping.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But he took her by the hand and called, saying, »Child, arise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Then her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And her parents were astonished, but he charged them to tell no one what had happened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
