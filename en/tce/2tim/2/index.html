But the word of God is not chained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Here is a trustworthy saying: if we died with him, we will also live with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>if we endure, we will also reign with him;if we deny him, he also will deny us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>if we are faithless, he remains faithful,for he cannot deny himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remind them of these things, and charge them in the presence of God to avoid disputing about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a workman who does not need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Avoid godless chatter, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who have gone astray from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and upset the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless, God's firm foundation stands, having this seal: »The Lord knows those who are his,« and, »Everyone who names the name of the Lord must turn away from wickedness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a large house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware, and some for noble use, some for ignoble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If anyone cleanses himself from what is ignoble, he will be a vessel for noble purposes, made holy, useful to the Master and prepared to do any good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now flee from youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Don't have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know that they produce quarrels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome, but he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, patient when wronged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God will grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, having been held captive by him to do his will.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
