Who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>This is the only thing I want to find out from you: did you receive the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by hearing with faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Did you suffer so many things in vainif it really was in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even so Abraham »believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, be sure that it is those who are of faith who are sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, »In you will all the nations be blessed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the man of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, »Cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, to do them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now that no one is justified by the Law before God is evident; for, »The righteous man shall live by faith.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the Law is not of faith; on the contrary, »He who does them shall live by them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the Law, having become a curse for usfor it is written, »Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To give a human example, brethren: even though it is only a man's covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one sets it aside or adds conditions to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, »And to seeds,« as referring to many, but rather to one, »And to your seed,« that is, Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I mean is this: the Law, which came four hundred and thirty years later, does not invalidate a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to nullify the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on a promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why the Law then? It was added because of transgressions, having been ordained through angels by the agency of a mediator, until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now a mediator does not represent just one party; but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the law then opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given which could impart life, then righteousness would indeed have come by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Scripture has bound everyone under sin, so that that what was promised by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now before faith came, we were bound under the law, kept under restraint until faith should be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the law was our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you are all sons of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
