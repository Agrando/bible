In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I wish that those who are troubling you would mutilate themselves!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you were called to freedom, brethren; only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another, take care that you are not consumed by one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh; for these are opposed to each other, so that you may not do what you would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the deeds of the flesh are obvious: immorality, impurity, lewdness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envy, drunkenness, carousing, and the like. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
