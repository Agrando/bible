Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ and turning to a different gospel</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>which is really not another gospel; but there are some who are disturbing you, and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you a gospel contrary to what we preached to you, let him be accursed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, so I say again now, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be accursed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how intensely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when God, who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through his grace, was pleased</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years, I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas and stayed with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(Now in what I am writing to you, I assure you before God that I do not lie.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I was still unknown by sight to the churches of Judea which were in Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>they only heard it said, »He who once persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they glorified God because of me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
