Father!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So you are no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Formerly, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature are no gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things? Do you desire to be enslaved all over again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You observe days and months and seasons and years!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I fear for you, that perhaps I have labored over you in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Brethren, I beg you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You have done me no wrong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>you know it was because of an illness in the flesh that I preached the gospel to you at first;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and though my fleshly condition was a trial to you, you did not despise or scorn me, but you received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What has become of the satisfaction you felt? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Have I now become your enemy by telling you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They seek you, but for no good purpose; they want to shut you out, so that you may seek them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is always good to seek a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My children, with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I could wish to be present with you now and to change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you who want to be under law, do you not listen to the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave and one by the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the son by the slave was born according to the flesh, and the son by the free woman through the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is allegorically speaking, for these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children who are to be slaves; she is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, »Rejoice, O barren woman who does not bear;break forth and shout, you who are not in labor;for the children of the desolate are more numerousthan the children of her who has a husband.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now you, brethren, like Isaac, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what does the scripture say? »Cast out the slave and her son, for the son of the slave shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brethren, we are not children of the slave, but of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
