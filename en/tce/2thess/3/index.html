We were not idle when we were with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with labor and hardship we worked night and day so that we would not be a burden to any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves an example for you to follow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: »If anyone will not work, he shall not eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For we hear that some among you are leading an undisciplined life, not doing any work at all, but acting like busybodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to work in quiet fashion and earn their own bread to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for you, brethren, do not grow weary of doing good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is a distinguishing mark in every letter; this is the way I write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
