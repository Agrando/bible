If anyone is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him consider this again within himself, that just as he is Christs, so also are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For even if I boast somewhat further about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I shall not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I do not wish to seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they say, »His letters are weighty and strong, but his personal presence is weak, and his speech of no account.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such people realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we do not dare to class or compare ourselves with some of those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves, and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not boast beyond proper limits, but will confine our boasting to the field God has apportioned to us, a field that reaches even to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we did not reach to you; we were the first to come even as far as you with the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We do not go beyond limits by boasting in other mens labors, but our hope is that as your faith grows, our sphere among you may be greatly enlarged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast of work already done in another man's territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, »Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For it is not he who commends himself that is approved, but he whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
