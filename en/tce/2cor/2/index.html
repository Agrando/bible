What I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>in order that Satan might gain no advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I still had no rest in my mind, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took my leave of them and went on to Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumph, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to the one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we are not, like so many, peddling the word of God; but as men of sincerity, as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
