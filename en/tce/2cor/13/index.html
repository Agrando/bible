Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I warned those who sinned in the past and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present the second time, that if I come again I will not spare them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>since you desire proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he was crucified in weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in youunless, indeed, you fail the test?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I trust that you will realize that we have not failed the test.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now we pray to God that you may not do wrongnot that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, even though we may seem to have failed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. What we pray for is your perfection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I write these things while I am absent, in order that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority which the Lord gave me for building you up, and not for tearing you down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Finally, brethren, farewell. Aim for perfection, listen to my appeal, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the saints greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
