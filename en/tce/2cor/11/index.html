I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped in the regions of Achaia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And what I am doing, I will also continue to do, in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things of which they boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore it is not surprising if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will be according to their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I repeat, let no one think me foolish; but even if you do, receive me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I am saying I am not saying as the Lord would, but as a fool, in this confidence of boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For you put up with fools gladly, being so wise yourselves!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you put up with anyone if he makes slaves of you, or preys upon you, or takes advantage of you, or exalts himself, or strikes you in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To my shame, I must say that we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone else dares to boast about혰I am speaking as a fool혰I also dare to boast about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one혰I am talking like a madman혰in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, with more beatings, and often in danger of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the open sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have been on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, in danger from robbers, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles, in danger in the city, in danger in the wilderness, in danger at sea, and in danger from false brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have been in labor and hardship, through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides such external things, there is the daily pressure on me of concern for all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I do not inwardly burn?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the governor under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
