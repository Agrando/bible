On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For it is the God who said, »Let light shine out of darkness,« who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>always carrying about in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For we who live are always being given up to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then death is at work in us, but life in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, »I believed and therefore I spoke,« we also believe and therefore speak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For all this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outer nature is wasting away, yet our inner nature is being renewed day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are unseen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are unseen are eternal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
