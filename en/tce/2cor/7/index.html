With all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even when we came into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted at every turnconflicts on the outside and fears within.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted in you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it. Though I did regret itfor I see that my letter hurt you, though only for a little while</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>now I rejoice, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led you to repentance; for you became sorrowful as God intended, so that you suffered no loss through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For godly sorrow produces a repentance that leads to salvation and brings no regret, but worldly sorrow produces death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For behold what this very thing, godly sorrow, has produced in you: what earnestness, what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what zeal, what readiness to see justice done! At every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So although I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did the wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your zeal for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore we are comforted. And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I have boasted to him about you, I was not put to shame; but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting before Titus has proved true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his affection goes out all the more to you, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice, because I have perfect confidence in you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
