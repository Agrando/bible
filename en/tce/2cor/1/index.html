But this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He delivered us from so deadly a peril, and he will deliver us; on him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You also must help us by your prayers, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us in answer to the prayers of many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For our boast is this: the testimony of our conscience, that with holiness and godly sincerity, not in worldly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and still more toward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For we write you nothing but what you can read and understand; and I hope you will understand fully,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as you have understood us in part, that you can be proud of us just as we can be of you, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a double benefit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and to come back to you from Macedonia, and then to have you send me on my way to Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When I was planning this, did I do it lightly? Or do I make my plans in a fleshly manner so that in the same breath I say, »Yes, Yes« and »No, No«?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you by usby me and Silvanus and Timothywas not Yes and No, but in him it has always been Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For as many as are the promises of God, in him they are Yes. And so through him we speak our Amen to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>he has put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I call God as my witness that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not that we lord it over your faith; but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
