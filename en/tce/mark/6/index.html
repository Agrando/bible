And many who heard him were astonished, saying, »Where did this man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to him, that such mighty works are performed by his hands!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?« And they took offense at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he marveled because of their unbelief. Then he went around the villages teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staffno bag, no bread, no money in their belts</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, »Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they went out and preached that people should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become well known. Some said, »John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these powers are at work in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But others said, »It is Elijah.« And others said, »It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard, he said, »This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent and had John arrested, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John had said to Herod, »It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for Herod feared John and protected him, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his high officers and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, »Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he vowed to her, »Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So she went out and said to her mother, »What shall I ask?« And she said, »The head of John the Baptist!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, »I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king was exceedingly sorry; but, because of his oaths and his guests, he did not want to refuse her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately the king sent an executioner and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The apostles gathered to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to them, »Come away by yourselves to a lonely place and rest a while.« For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When Jesus went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him and said, »This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Send them away, so they can go to the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves something to eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he answered them, »You give them something to eat.« And they said to him, »Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he said to them, »How many loaves do you have? Go and see.« And when they found out they said, »Five, and two fish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they sat down in groups, of hundreds and fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they all ate and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And after he had left them, he went up on the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he saw the disciples straining at the oars, for the wind was against them. About the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He was about to pass by them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>for they all saw him, and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then he climbed into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were completely amazed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for they had not understood about the loaves, because their hearts were hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and ran about that whole region, and began to carry those who were sick around on pallets to wherever they heard he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Wherever he entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched him were made well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
