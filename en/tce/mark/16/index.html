You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had gripped them. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went and told it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Later he appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, »Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they will pick up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then they went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that accompanied it. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
