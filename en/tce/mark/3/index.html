And they came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he appointed twelve, that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to cast out the demons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, »Sons of Thunder«;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he went home; and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, »He is out of his mind.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, »He is possessed by Beelzebub, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he called them to himself and said to them in parables: »How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because they said, »He has an unclean spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then his brothers and his mother came. And standing outside they sent to him, and called him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And a crowd was sitting around him; and they said to him, »Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he replied, »Who are my mother and my brothers?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he looked at those who sat in a circle around him, and said, »Here are my mother and my brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
