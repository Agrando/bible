A sower went out to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as he sowed the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Some fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when the sun came up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, »He who has ears to hear, let him hear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, »To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those outside everything is in parables;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that seeing they may see but not perceive,and hearing may hear but not understand;lest they should turn again, and be forgiven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, »Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower sows the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are the ones along the path where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these likewise are the ones sown on rocky ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they have no root in themselves, but endure for only a time. Then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But these are the ones sown on good soil, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit thirtyfold, sixty, and a hundred.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to them, »Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hidden, except to be revealed; nor is anything secret, but that it should come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he said to them, »Take heed what you hear. With the measure you use, it will be measured to you; and more will be given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever has, to him will more be given; and whoever does not have, from him even what he has will be taken away.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, »The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All by itself the earth produces grainfirst the blade, then the head, then the full kernel in the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, »With what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is the smallest of all seeds in the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But without a parable he did not speak to them. And when they were alone, he explained everything to his own disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, »Let us go over to the other side.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat. There were also other boats with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And a great storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. And they woke him and said to him, »Teacher, do you not care if we perish?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he rose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, »Peace! Be still!« And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He said to them, »Why are you so afraid? Have you no faith?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, »Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
