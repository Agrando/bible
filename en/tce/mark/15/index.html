See how many things they bring against you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus still made no answer, so that Pilate was amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now at the feast he was accustomed to release for them one prisoner whom they requested.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And with the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he had always done for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Pilate answered them, »Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he knew it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Pilate again said to them, »Then what shall I do with the man whom you call the King of the Jews?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cried out again, »Crucify him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Pilate said to them, »Why, what evil has he done?« But they shouted all the more, »Crucify him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged him, to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium) and they called together the whole battalion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and they twisted a crown of thorns and put it on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they began to salute him, »Hail, King of the Jews!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they struck him on the head with a reed and spat on him; and falling on their knees, they paid homage to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked him, they took the purple robe off him, and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they compelled a certain man, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to carry his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then they offered him wine mingled with myrrh, but he did not take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they crucified him, they divided his garments,casting lots for themto determine what each man should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the inscription of the charge written against him read: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="28">28</a></span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And those who passed by hurled insults at him, wagging their heads, and saying, »Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>save yourself, and come down from the cross!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So also the chief priests mocked him among themselves with the scribes, and said, »He saved others; he cannot save himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe.« Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, »Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?«which means, »My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When some of those standing near heard this, they said, »Behold, he is calling Elijah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And one ran and filled a sponge full of wine vinegar, put it on a reed, and offered it to him to drink, saying, »Wait, let us see if Elijah will come to take him down.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And with a loud cry, Jesus breathed his last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So when the centurion, who stood opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, »Truly this man was the Son of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>who also followed him and ministered to him when he was in Galilee; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Pilate marveled that he was already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if he was already dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then he bought fine linen, took him down, and wrapped him in the linen. And he laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
