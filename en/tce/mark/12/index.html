And he leased it to vine dressers and went into a far country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants, to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they took him and beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he sent to them another servant, and they wounded him in the head, and treated him shamefully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he sent another, and him they killed; and so with many others, some they beat and some they killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He still had one left to send, a beloved son. He sent him to them last, saying, They will respect my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But those tenants said to one another, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they took him and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants, and give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have you not read this Scripture: The stone which the builders rejectedhas become the chief cornerstone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>this was the Lords doing,and it is marvelous in our eyes?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they sought to arrest him, but feared the multitude, for they knew he had spoken the parable against them. So they left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When they came, they said to him, »Teacher, we know that you are true, and care about no man; for you do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Should we pay them, or should we not?« But knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, »Why do you put me to the test? Bring me a denarius, and let me look at it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they brought one. And he said to them, »Whose likeness and inscription is this?« They said to him, »Caesar's.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to them, »Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.« And they were amazed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him; and they asked him a question, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the second took her, and he died; leaving behind no children. And the third likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the seven had her and left no children. Last of all the woman died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the resurrection, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus said to them, »Is not this why you are wrong, that you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is not the God of the dead, but of the living; you are greatly mistaken.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he had answered them well, asked him, »Which commandment is the first of all?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered, »The first is: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The second is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the scribe said to him, »You are right, Teacher; you have well said that God is one, and there is no other but he;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, »You are not far from the kingdom of God.« And after that no one dared to ask him any question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus said, while he taught in the temple, »How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>David himself, speaking by the Holy Spirit, declared: The Lord said to my Lord:»Sit at my right handtill I put your enemies under your feet.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Therefore David himself calls him Lord; how is he then his son?« And the common people heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And in his teaching he said, »Beware of the scribes, who like to go around in long robes, and to have salutations in the market places</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many people who were rich put in large sums.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, »Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everythingall she had to live on.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
