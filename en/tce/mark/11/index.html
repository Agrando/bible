Untie it and bring it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anyone says to you, Why are you doing this? say, The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They went away and found a colt tied at the door outside in the open street, and they untied it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And some of those who stood there said to them, »What are you doing, untying the colt?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They answered as Jesus had told them to, and they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments on it, and he sat on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And many spread their garments on the road, and others spread leafy branches which they had cut from the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who went before and those who followed cried out, »Hosanna!Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that is coming!Hosanna in the highest!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus entered Jerusalem, and went into the temple. And when he had looked round at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the next day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to it, »May no one ever eat fruit from you again.« And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they came to Jerusalem. And Jesus entered the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as he taught them, he said, »Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations?But you have made it a den of robbers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and sought a way to destroy him; for they feared him, because all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When evening came, they went out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter remembered and said to him, »Rabbi, look! The fig tree which you cursed has withered.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answered them, »Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="26">26</a></span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said to him, »By what authority are you doing these things? Who gave you this authority to do them?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to them, »I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The baptism of Johnwas it from heaven or from men? Answer me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they reasoned among themselves, »If we say, From heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if we say, From men«they feared the people, for all held that John was a real prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they answered Jesus, »We do not know.« And Jesus said to them, »Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
