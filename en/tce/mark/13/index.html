There will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Tell us, when will this be? And what will be the sign when these things are all to be fulfilled?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus began to say to them: »Take heed that no one deceives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and will deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; such things must happen, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginning of birth pains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But watch out for yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they bring you to trial and deliver you up, do not worry beforehand what you are to say. But say whatever is given you in that hour; for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you will be hated by all men for my name's sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»When you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let him who is in the field not go back to get his cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But woe for those who are pregnant and those who are nursing babies in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray that it may not happen in winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For in those days there will be tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if the Lord had not shortened those days, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ! or, Look, he is there! do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But take heed; see, I have told you all things beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened,and the moon will not give its light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the stars will fall from heaven,and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then he will send out his angels, and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So also, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away before all these things take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Take heed, watch; for you do not know when the time will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves his house and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Watch thereforefor you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
