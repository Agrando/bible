And he cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, »Let us alone! What have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you arethe Holy One of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, »Be quiet, and come out of him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, »What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as they left the synagogue, they went with James and John, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now in the morning, a long while before daylight, he rose and went out to a solitary place, and there he prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and when they found him, they said to him, »Everyone is looking for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, »Let us go on to the next towns, so I may preach there also; for that is why I have come.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then a leper came to him, imploring him, kneeling down to him and saying to him, »If you are willing, you can make me clean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus, moved with compassion, put out his hand and touched him, and said to him, »I am willing; be clean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he strictly warned him and sent him away at once,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and he said to him, »See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was outside in the deserted places; and people came to him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
