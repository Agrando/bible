And there are many other traditions which they observe, the washing of cups and pitchers and copper vessels. )</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, »Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with impure hands?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, »Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites; as it is written: This people honors me with their lips,but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In vain they worship me,teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You let go of the commandment of God, and hold on to the tradition of men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them, »You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is Corban (that is, a gift devoted to God),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he called all the people to him again, and said to them, »Hear me, everyone, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him.«</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="16">16</a></span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When he had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about this parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he said to them, »Are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>since it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?« (Thus he declared all foods clean.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, »What comes out of a man is what defiles a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of the heart of men, come evil thoughts, fornications, theft, murder, adultery,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>coveting, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evil things come from within, and they defile a man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and did not want anyone to know it; yet he could not be hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard about him, and she came and fell at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to her, »Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But she answered him, »Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he said to her, »For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>She went home, and found her child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he departed from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged him to put his hand on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him, »Ephphatha,« that is, »Be opened.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he commanded them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more widely they proclaimed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, »He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
