If the worshipers had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any consciousness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, when Christ came into the world, he said: »Sacrifice and offering you did not desire,but a body you prepared for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>in burnt offerings and sin offeringsyou have taken no pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, Behold,I have come to do your will, O God,as it is written of me in the roll of the book.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When he said above, »You did not desire, nor did you take pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings« (these are offered according to the law),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then he said, »Behold, I have come to do your will.« He takes away the first in order to establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every priest stands daily at his service, offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when he had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>waiting from that time until his enemies be made a stool for his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»This is the covenant that I will makewith them after those days, says the Lord:I will put my laws into their hearts,and in their minds I will write them,«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>then he adds, »Their sins and their lawless deedsI will remember no more.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by a new and living way which he opened for us through the curtain, that is, his flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more, as you see the Day drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we sin deliberately after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>How much severer punishment do you think a man will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has regarded as an unclean thing the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know him who said, »Vengeance is mine, I will repay.« And again, »The Lord will judge his people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But remember the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle with sufferings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>sometimes being publicly exposed to insult and persecution; and at other times standing side by side with those who were so treated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For you had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what was promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»For yet in a very little while,he who is coming will come and will not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But my righteous one shall live by faith,and if he shrinks back,my soul has no pleasure in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and keep their souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
