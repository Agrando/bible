Let them do this with joy, and not with grief, for that would be of no advantage to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I urge you all the more to do this so that I may be restored to you the sooner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>equip you with every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever.
