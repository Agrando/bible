And through faith he still speaks, even though he is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him. For before he was taken he was attested as having pleased God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And without faith it is impossible to please God, for anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in godly fear prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he lived in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he was looking forward to the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, because she considered him faithful who had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and greeted them from a distance, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For people who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if they had been thinking of that country from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>of whom it was said, »Through Isaac shall your descendants be called.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He considered that God was able to raise men even from the dead; from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped as he leaned on the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, when he was at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites, and gave orders concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king's edict.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He considered abuse suffered for the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king; for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith the people passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who through faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of justice, received promises, shut the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, whose weakness was turned to strength, who became mighty in war, and put foreign armies to flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received back their dead, raised to life again. Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated </span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>of whom the world was not worthy  wandering in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And all these, though well attested by their faith, did not receive what was promised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>because God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
