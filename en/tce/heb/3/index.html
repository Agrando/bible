And we are his house, if we hold fast to our confidence and the hope of which we boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: »Today, if you will hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,on the day of testing in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>where your fathers put me to the testand saw my works for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I was angry with that generation,and said, They always go astray in their hearts;and they have not known my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As I swore in my wrath,They shall never enter my rest.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Take care, brethren, lest there be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called »Today,« so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we have come to share in Christ if we hold our first confidence firm to the end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>while it is said, »Today, if you will hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were they who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
