God is treating you as sons; for what son is there whom his father does not discipline?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you are left without discipline, in which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Besides this, we have had fathers of our flesh to discipline us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant; but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore lift your feeble hands and strengthen your weak knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint, but rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God; that no root of bitterness spring up and cause trouble, and by it many become defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that no one be immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it diligently with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and to a blazing fire, and to darkness and gloom and whirlwind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the blast of a trumpet, and the sound of a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further word be spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they could not endure the order that was given, »If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The sight was so terrifying that Moses said, »I am trembling with fear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the joyful assembly</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the Judge of all, and to the spirits of righteous men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks better than the blood of Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See to it that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, how much less shall we escape, if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, »Yet once more I will shake not only the earth, but also heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This phrase, »Yet once more,« indicates the removing of those things which can be shaken, as of created things, in order that what cannot be shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful, and offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
