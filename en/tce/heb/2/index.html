It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was confirmed to us by those who heard him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>while God also bore witness, by signs and wonders and various miracles, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it is not to angels that he subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But there is a place where someone has testified, »What is man that you are mindful of him,or the son of man that you care for him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You made him for a little while lower than the angels;you crowned him with glory and honor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and put everything in subjection under his feet.« Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. As it is, we do not yet see everything subject to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was fitting that he, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both he who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, »I will declare your name to my brethren,in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, »I will put my trust in him.« And again, »Here am I, and the children God has given me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and might free those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned, but with the descendants of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For because he himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
