But we urge you, brethren, to do so more and more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life, to mind your own business and to work with your hands, just as we told you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve as do the rest who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this we declare to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then we who are alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
