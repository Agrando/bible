Is it not the rich who oppress you? Is it not they who drag you into court?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Is it not they who blaspheme the honorable name by which you have been called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you really fulfill the royal law, according to the scripture, »You shall love your neighbor as yourself,« you are doing well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point has become guilty of all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who said, »Do not commit adultery,« said also, »Do not murder.« If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment will be without mercy to one who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What good is it, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has no works? Can such faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you says to them, »Go in peace, be warmed and filled,« and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But someone will say, »You have faith and I have works.« Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believeand shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But are you willing to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is useless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see that faith was working with his works, and faith was completed by works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the scripture was fulfilled which says, »Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness«, and he was called the friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works, when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
