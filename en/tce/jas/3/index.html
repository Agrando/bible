If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If we put bits into the mouths of horses that they may obey us, we guide their whole bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Look at the ships also; though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. See how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire, a world of evil among the members of the body. The tongue corrupts our whole person, sets the whole course of our life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every species of beasts and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the likeness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brethren, this ought not to be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brethren, produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Nor can salt water produce fresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good life let him show his deeds in the humility of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not such as comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every evil practice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, without uncertainty or hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
