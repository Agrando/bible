Is it not your passions that are at war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You desire and do not have; so you kill. And you covet and cannot obtain; so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you think that the Scripture says without reason: »He jealously desires the Spirit which he has made to dwell in us«?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, »God opposes the proud,but gives grace to the humble.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not speak against one another, brethren. He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the one who is able to save and destroy. But youwho are you to judge your neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, you who say, »Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a city, and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet you do not know what will happen tomorrow. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead, you ought to say, »If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
