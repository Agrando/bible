So will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial, for when he has stood the test, he will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no one say when he is tempted, »I am being tempted by God«; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself does not tempt anyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is full-grown, it brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This you know, my beloved brethren. But everyone must be quick to hear, slow to speak and slow to anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and rank growth of wickedness, in humility receive the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But prove yourselves doers of the word, and not merely hearers who deceive themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he looks at himself and goes away, and immediately forgets what he was like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But one who looks intently into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but a doer that acts, this man will be blessed in what he does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is worthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Religion that is pure and undefiled in the sight of our God and Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
