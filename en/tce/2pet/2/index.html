Bold and willful, they are not afraid to revile the glorious ones,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>whereas angels, though greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling judgment against them before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and killed, reviling in matters of which they are ignorant, will be destroyed in the same destruction with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>suffering wrong for their wrongdoing. They count it a pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, as they carouse with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have eyes full of adultery, that never cease from sin; they entice unstable souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray, having followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but he was rebuked for his own transgression by a donkeya beast without speechwho spoke with a man's voice and restrained the prophet's madness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are springs without water and mists driven by a storm; for them the blackest darkness has been reserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For speaking out arrogant words of vanity, they entice by fleshly desires, by sensuality, those who barely escape from the ones who live in error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They promise them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for whatever overcomes a man, to that he is enslaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and are overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn away from the holy commandment handed on to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It has happened to them according to the true proverb, »A dog turns back to its own vomit,« and, »A sow, after having washed, returns to wallowing in the mire.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
