For if you do these things, you will never fall;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>so there will be an entrance richly provided for you into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I will always remind you of these things, even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>since I know that the putting aside of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ has made clear to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will see to it that after my departure you will be able at any time to call these things to mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For we did not follow cleverly devised tales when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him by the Majestic Glory, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We ourselves heard this voice coming from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And we have the prophetic word made more sure, and you will do well to pay attention to this as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for no prophecy was ever made by the act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
