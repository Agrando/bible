For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They deliberately ignore this fact, that by the word of God heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and by means of water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>through which the world at that time was destroyed, being deluged with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a roar and the elements will be destroyed with fire, and the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way, what sort of people ought you to be in holy lives and godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by fire, and the elements will melt with intense heat!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But according to his promise we are looking for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, beloved, since you look for these things, be diligent to be found by him in peace, spotless and blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation; just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He writes the same way in all his letters, speaking in them of these matters. His letters contain some things that are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on your guard so that you are not carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your own steadfastness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
