Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus you will know them by their fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Not every one who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On that day many will say to me, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And then will I declare to them, I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell. And great was its fall.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when Jesus had finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
