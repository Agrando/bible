But only say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, »Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then to the centurion Jesus said, »Go; be it done for you as you have believed.« And his servant was healed at that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus come into Peters house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and served him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When evening had come, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed. And he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: »He took up our infirmitiesand bore our diseases.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then a certain scribe came and said to him, »Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus said to him, »Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Another of the disciples said to him, »Lord, let me first go and bury my father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus said to him, »Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But he was asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The disciples went and woke him, saying, »Lord, save us! We are perishing!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to them, »Why are you afraid, O you of little faith?« Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the men marveled, saying, »What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he had come to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And behold, they cried out, »What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the demons begged him, »If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said to them, »Go.« So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then those who kept them fled, and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
