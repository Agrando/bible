For it is written, He will give his angels charge of you,and In their hands they will bear you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to him, »Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to him, »All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to him, »Away, Satan! for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your Godand him only shall you serve.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he withdrew to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And leaving Nazareth, he went and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»The land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>the people who sat in darknesshave seen a great light,and on those who sat in the region and shadow of deathlight has dawned.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From that time Jesus began to preach and say, »Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to them, »Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Immediately they left their nets and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And he called them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought to him all sick people who were afflicted with various diseases and pains, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Great crowds followed himfrom Galilee, and from the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
