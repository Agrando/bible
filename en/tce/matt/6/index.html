If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>»Thus, when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>so that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when you pray, go into your room, shut the door and pray to your Father, who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when you pray, do not use empty repetitions as the Gentiles do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Pray, then, in this way: Our Father in heaven,hallowed be your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Your kingdom come,your will be doneon earth as it is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give us this day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And forgive us our debts,as we also have forgiven our debtors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»And when you fast, do not look gloomy, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so that you do not appear to be fasting to men, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The lamp of the body is the eye. So if your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his span of life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore do not worry, saying, What shall we eat? or What shall we drink? or What shall we wear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the Gentiles seek after all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be given to you as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
