Come, see the place where he lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead. And behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Behold, I have told you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And behold, Jesus met them and said, »Hail!« And they came to him and took hold of his feet and worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them, »Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee; and there they will see me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and said, »Tell them, His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this comes to the governors ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came and said to them, »All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
