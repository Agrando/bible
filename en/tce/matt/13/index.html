This is the seed sown along the path.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he who received the seed on rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. And when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he falls away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the one who received seed on the good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but while men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So when the plants sprouted and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then has it weeds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to them, An enemy has done this. The servants said to him, Then do you want us to go and gather them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said, No, lest while you gather up the weeds you also root up the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let both grow together until the harvest; and at harvest time I will tell the reapers. Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Another parable he put forth to them, saying: »The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>it is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He told them another parable: »The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour till it was all leavened.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>All these things Jesus spoke to the crowd in parables; and without a parable he did not speak to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet: »I will open my mouth in parables,I will utter things hiddensince the foundation of the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he left the crowd and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, »Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He answered, »He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the field is the world, and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the enemy who sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore as the weeds are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and then in his joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who, when he had found one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>which, when it was full, they drew it up on the shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus asked, »Have you understood all these things?« »Yes,« they said to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he said to them, »Therefore every scribe who has been instructed for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When Jesus had finished these parables, he moved on from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And coming to his own country he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, »Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Is this not the carpenters son? Is not his mother called Mary? And his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
