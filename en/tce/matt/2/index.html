For we have seen his star in the East and have come to worship him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they said to him, »In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;for out of you shall come a rulerwho will be the shepherd of my people Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod called the wise men secretly and determined from them what time the star had appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, »Go and search diligently for the young child, and when you have found him, bring back word to me, so that I too may come and worship him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they had heard the king they went their way; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, until it came to rest over the place where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>On coming into the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they fell down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, and of frankincense, and of myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, »Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he rose, he took the young child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and remained there until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, »Out of Egypt have I called my son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»A voice was heard in Ramah,lamentation, weeping, and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children,refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, »Rise, take the young child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the young childs life are dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the Prophets might be fulfilled, »He shall be called a Nazarene.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
