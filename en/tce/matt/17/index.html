His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Peter said to Jesus, »Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make here three tabernaclesone for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and a voice from the cloud said, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces, and were filled with awe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus came and touched them and said, »Rise. Dont be afraid.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, »Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the disciples asked him, »Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus replied, »Elijah is coming first and will restore all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I tell you that Elijah has come already, and they did not know him but did to him whatever they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer at their hands.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and kneeling before him said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire, and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jesus answered, »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him, and the boy was cured from that moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, »Why could we not cast it out?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So he said to them, »Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.«</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="21">21</a></span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now while they were staying in Galilee, Jesus said to them, »The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day.« And they were greatly distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the half-shekel tax went up to Peter and said, »Does not your teacher pay the temple tax?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said, »Yes.« And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, »What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from others?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when Peter said, »From others,« Jesus said to him, »Then the sons are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nevertheless, so that we may not offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you open its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for me and you.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
