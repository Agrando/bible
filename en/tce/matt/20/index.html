Did you not agree with me for a denarius?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as I gave to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Is it not lawful for me to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the last will be first, and the first will be last.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the mother of Zebedees sons came to him with her sons and, kneeling down, asked something of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to her, »What do you want?« She said to him, »Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus answered, »You do not know what you are asking for. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?« They said to him, »We are able.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, »You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right or my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the ten heard it, they were indignant with the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called them to him and said, »You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you must be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, two blind men sitting by the roadside, when they heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out, »Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be quiet; but they cried out all the more, »Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus stopped and called them, saying, »What do you want me to do for you? »</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They said to him, »Lord, let our eyes be opened.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes. Immediately they received their sight and followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
