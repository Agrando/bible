For she has done a beautiful thing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For in pouring this perfume on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said, »What are you willing to give me if I deliver him to you?« And they counted out to him thirty pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, »Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, »Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, The Teacher says, my time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When evening had come, he sat at the table with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as they were eating, he said, »Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were very sorrowful, and began to say to him one after another, »Is it I, Lord?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He answered, »He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of Man goes just as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Judas, who was betraying him, answered, »Rabbi, is it I?« He said to him, »You have said it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, »Take, eat; this is my body.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, »Drink from it, all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them, »You will all fall away because of me this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter declared to him, »Even if all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, »Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said to him, »Even if I have to die with you, I will not deny you.« And so said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, »Sit here while I go over there and pray.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he said to them, »My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, »O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, »So, could you not watch with me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and pray, so that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, »O my Father, if this cup cannot pass away unless I drink it, your will be done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, »Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, »The one I kiss is the man; seize him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And at once he went up to Jesus and said, »Greetings, Rabbi!« and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, »Friend, why are you here?« Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But Jesus said to him, »Put your sword back in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But how then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen in this way?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, »Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this has taken place, that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.« Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said, »This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest stood up and said, »Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, »I charge you under oath by the living God: tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him, »It is as you said. But I say to you, hereafter you will see the Son of Mansitting at the right hand of the Power,and coming on the clouds of heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, »He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard his blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What do you think?« They answered, »He is worthy of death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists; and others slapped him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, »Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him and said, »You also were with Jesus of Galilee.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied it before them all, saying, »I do not know what you are talking about.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he went out to the gateway, another girl saw him and said to the people there, »This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>But again he denied it with an oath, »I do not know the man!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>After a little while those who stood by came up and said to Peter, »Surely you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, »I do not know the man.« And immediately the rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the word Jesus had said, »Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.« So he went out and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
