Come to the wedding.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they made light of it and went off, one to his own farm, another to his business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The king was enraged. He sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to his servants, The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go therefore to the highways, and invite to the marriage feast as many as you find.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And those servants went out into the streets and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good; so the wedding hall was filled with guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to him, Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king said to the attendants, Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called, but few are chosen.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how to entangle him in his talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, »Teacher, we know that you are true, and teach the way of God in truth, and you care for no man; for you do not regard the position of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us, then, what do you think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, »Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me the money for the tax.« And they brought him a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to them, »Whose image and inscription is this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said, »Caesars.« Then he said to them, »Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they heard it, they marveled; and they left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him a question,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, »Teacher, Moses said that if a man dies, having no children, his brother must marry the widow, and raise up children for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and having no children, he left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the second also, and the third, down to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After them all, the woman died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Jesus answered them, »You are wrong, because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, to test him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, »You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the great and first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?« They said to him, »The son of David.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said to them, »How is it then that David, inspired by the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The Lord said to my Lord,»Sit at my right hand,till I put your enemies under your feet«?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did any one dare to ask him any more questions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
