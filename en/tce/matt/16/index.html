Do you not remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How is it that you do not understand that I did not speak to you about bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, »Who do men say that the Son of Man is?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they said, »Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, »But who do you say that I am?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon Peter answered, »You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answered him, »Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I tell you, that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he strictly charged his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time Jesus began to show to his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him saying, »Never, Lord! This shall never happen to you!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he turned and said to Peter, »Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me; for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples, »If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of Man is to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will reward each man according to what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
