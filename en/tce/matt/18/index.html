For temptations must come, but woe to the man by whom the temptation comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life maimed or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="11">11</a></span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains in search of the one that went astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he will not listen, take one or two others along with you, so that every matter may be established by the word of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say to you, that if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter came to him and said, »Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him, »I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When he began the settlement, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he was not able to pay, his master ordered that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the servant fell on his knees before him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The master of that servant took pity on him, released him, and forgave him the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what you owe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, Have patience with me, and I will pay you back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he refused, and went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and went and told their master all that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So also my heavenly Father will do to each of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
