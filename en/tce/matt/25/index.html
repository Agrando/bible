Come out to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise replied, No, there may not be enough for both us and you; go rather to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he replied, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore keep watch, for you know neither the day nor the hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went on his journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them; and he made five talents more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So also, he who had the two talents gained two more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground, and hid his masters money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So he who had received the five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, Master, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He also who had received the two talents came and said, Master, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But his master answered him, You wicked and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore take the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>All the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he will put the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the King will say to those on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you took me in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then the righteous will answer him, Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When did we see you a stranger and take you in, or naked and clothe you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you did it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Then he will say to those on his left hand, Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger and you did not take me in, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then they also will answer, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he will answer them, Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
