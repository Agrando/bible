But if the salt loses its taste, how shall it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will by any means pass from the Law until all is accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whoever then breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I tell you, that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you that anyone who is angry with his brother shall be subject to judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be answerable to the council. But whoever says, You fool! shall be in danger of the fire of hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave your gift there before the altar, and go. First be reconciled to your brother; and then come and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him to court, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Truly, I say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You have heard that it was said, You shall not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than for your whole body to go into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»It has also been said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, causes her to become an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say to you, do not swear at all: either by heaven, for it is Gods throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>or by the earth, for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make even one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Simply let your Yes be Yes, and your No, No; anything more than this comes from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. But if someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you greet only your brethren, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
