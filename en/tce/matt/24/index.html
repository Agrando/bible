Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now as he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, »Tell us, when will this be? And what will be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered them: »Take heed that no one deceives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and will deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All these are the beginning of birth pains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then they will deliver you up to tribulation, and put you to death; and you will be hated by all nations for my names sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And then many will fall away, and will betray one another, and hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because wickedness will increase, the love of most will grow cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he who endures to the end will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»So when you see standing in the holy place the abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel (let the reader understand)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But woe for those who are pregnant and for those who are nursing babies in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if those days had not been shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if any one says to you, Look, here is the Christ! or There he is! do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For false christs and false prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See, I have told you beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So if they say to you, There he is, out in the desert, do not go out; or, Here he is, in the inner rooms, do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened,and the moon will not give its light;the stars will fall from heaven,and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So also, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away till all these things take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and they did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But know this, that if the owner of the house had known at what time of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes will find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if that servant is wicked and says to himself, My master is staying away a long time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and he then begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
