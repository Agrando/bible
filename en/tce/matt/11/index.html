A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft clothing are in kings houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is he of whom it is written: Behold, I send my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and men of violence take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you are willing to accept it, he is the Elijah who is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners! But wisdom is justified by her deeds.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven?You shall be brought down to Hades.For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus declared, »I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»All things have been delivered to me by my Father. No one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
