They asked, »Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he answered them, »Have you not read that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said, For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to him, »Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, »Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciples said to him, »If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, »Not all men can accept this saying, but only those to whom it has been given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are eunuchs who were born that way from their mothers womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then little children were brought to him that he might put his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, »Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he laid his hands on them and went from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now behold, one came up and said to him, »Teacher, what good thing must I do to have eternal life?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, »Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to him, »Which ones?« And Jesus said, »You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>honor your father and mother, and, you shall love your neighbor as yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said to him, »All these I have kept. What do I still lack?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, »If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard this, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples, »Truly I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished, saying, »Who then can be saved?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus looked at them and said to them, »With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter answered him, »Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then shall we have?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said to them, »Truly I say to you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And every one who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my names sake, will receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
