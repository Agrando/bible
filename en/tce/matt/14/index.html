But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus went ashore he saw a great throng; and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, »This is a remote place, and its already getting late. Send the crowds away, so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said, »They do not need to go away. You give them something to eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They said to him, »We have only five loaves here and two fish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, »Bring them here to me,«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass. And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to the disciples; and the disciples gave them to the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but the boat by this time was many furlongs distant from the land, beaten by the waves; for the wind was against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, saying, »It is a ghost!« And they cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, »Take courage! It is I; do not be afraid.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter answered him, »Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So he said, »Come«. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, »Lord, save me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus immediately reached out his hand and caught him, and said to him, »O you of little faith, why did you doubt?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, »Truly you are the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent to all that surrounding region and brought to him all who were sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and begged him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
