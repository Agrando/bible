But do not do what they do; for they preach, but do not practice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on mens shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with their finger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they do all their works to be seen by men; for they make their phylacteries broad and the tassels of their garments long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, Rabbi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you are not to be called Rabbi, for you have only one Master, and you are all brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And do not call anyone on earth your Father, for you have one Father, he who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor are you to be called Teacher, for you have one Teacher, the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who is greatest among you shall be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither enter yourselves, nor do you allow those who would enter to go in.</span> <span class="verse empty"><a name="14">14</a></span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win a single proselyte, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Woe to you, blind guides, who say, If any one swears by the temple, it is nothing; but if any one swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you say, If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing; but if anyone swears by the gift that is on it, he is bound by his oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he who swears by the temple, swears by it and by him who dwells in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by him who sits on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the Law, justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Blind Pharisee! First cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which outwardly appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead mens bones and all uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you say, If we had lived in the days of our forefathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus you witness against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You serpents! You brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from town to town,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Truly, I say to you, all this will come upon this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Behold, your house is left to you desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
