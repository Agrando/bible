Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Bear fruit worthy of repentance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I tell you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But John tried to prevent him, saying, »I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus answered him, »Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.« Then he consented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And behold, a voice from heaven, saying, »This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
