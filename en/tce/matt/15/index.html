For they do not wash their hands when they eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He answered them, »And why do you transgress the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God commanded, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say that if a man says to his father or mother, Whatever help you might have received from me is a gift to God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he is not to honor his father with it. Thus you have made the word of God of no effect for the sake of your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, when he said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These people honor me with their lips,but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In vain do they worship me,teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he called the people to him and said to them, »Hear and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the disciples came and said to him, »Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He answered, »Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into a pit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Peter said to him, »Explain the parable to us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jesus said, »Are you also still without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not yet see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornications, theft, false witness, slander.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are what defile a man; but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and cried to him, »Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, »Send her away, for she is crying out after us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He answered, »I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But she came and knelt before him, saying, »Lord, help me!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he answered, »It is not good to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Yes, Lord,« she said, »yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered her, »O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire.« And her daughter was healed from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus went on from there and passed along the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain, and sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the maimed, the blind, the mute, and many others; and they laid them down at his feet, and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the multitude marveled when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed made whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now Jesus called his disciples to him and said, »I have compassion on the multitude, because they have been with me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then his disciples said to him, »Where could we get enough bread in the wilderness to feed such a great crowd?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, »How many loaves do you have?« They said, »Seven, and a few small fish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He told the crowd to sit down on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all ate and were satisfied; and they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he sent away the crowds, got into the boat, and went to the region of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
