And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There will no longer be any curse; and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there will be no more night. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, for the Lord God will give them light; and they will reign for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, »These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants the things which must soon take place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he said to me, »Do not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to me, »Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who does wrong, let him do wrong still; and he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he who does right, let him do right still; and he who is holy, let him be holy still.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Behold, I am coming soon, and my reward is with me, to render to every man according to what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter by the gates into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the immoral persons and the murderers and the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches.
