No one could learn the song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are the ones who have not been defiled with women, for they have kept themselves chaste. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And no lie was found in their mouth; they are blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he said with a loud voice, »Fear God, and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come; worship him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and springs of water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another angel, a second, followed, saying, »Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all the nations drink the wine of her impure passion.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, »If any one worships the beast and its image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he also will drink of the wine of Gods wrath, which is poured in full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever; they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, »Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!« »Yes,« says the Spirit, »that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, »Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, because the harvest of the earth is ripe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then another angel came out from the altar, the one who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, »Put in your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, because its grapes are ripe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the clusters from the vine of the earth, and threw them into the great wine press of the wrath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press, as high as the horses' bridles for a distance of one thousand six hundred stadia.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
