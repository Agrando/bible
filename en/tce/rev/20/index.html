After these things he must be released for a short time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom judgment was given. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony to Jesus and because of the word of God, and who had not worshipped the beast or his image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life, and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and will come out to deceive the nations which are at the four corners of the earth, that is, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and devoured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it; from his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them, and all were judged according to what they had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
