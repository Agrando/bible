But if you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet you have a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These are the words of him who is holy, who is true,who has the key of David,who opens and no one shuts,and shuts and no one opens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I know your works.
