and the earth was made bright with his splendor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he called out with a mighty voice, »Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great!She has become a dwelling place of demons,a haunt of every unclean spirit,a haunt of every uncleanand hateful bird.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For all nations have drunk the wineof her impure passion,and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her,and the merchants of the earth have grown richwith the wealth of her wantonness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then I heard another voice from heaven, saying, »Come out of her, my people,so that you will not share in her sinsand receive of her plagues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>for her sins are piled up as high as heaven,and God has remembered her iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Pay her back even as she has paid,and give back to her double according to her deeds;in the cup which she has mixed,mix a double portion for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As she glorified herself and played the wanton,so give her a like measure of torment and mourning;for she says in her heart,A queen I sit,and I am not a widow,mourning I will never see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore in one day her plagues will come,pestilence and mourning and famine,and she will be burned with fire;for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the kings of the earth, who committed fornication and were wanton with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, Woe, woe, the great city,the mighty city, Babylon!In one hour has your judgment come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargoes any more</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>cargoes of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk and scarlet cloth; every sort of citron wood, and articles of every kind made of ivory, costly wood, bronze, iron and marble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>cargoes of cinnamon and spice, of incense, myrrh and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, of fine flour and wheat; cattle and sheep; horses and chariots; and slaves and human souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The fruit you longed forhas gone from you,and all your riches and splendorhave vanished,never to be recovered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The merchants of these things, who gained wealth from her, will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, Woe, woe, the great city,she who was clothed in fine linenand purple and scarlet,and adorned with goldand precious stones and pearls!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!And every shipmaster and all passengers and sailors, and all who make their living by the sea, stood far off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city is like the great city?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city,where all who had ships at seabecame rich by her wealth,for in one hour she has been laid waste!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, O heaven,and you saints and apostles and prophets,because God has pronounced judgment for you against her!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, »So will Babylon, the great city,be thrown down with violence,and will not be found any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the sound of harpists and musiciansand flute-players and trumpeterswill not be heard in you any longer;and no craftsman of any craftwill be found in you any longer;and the sound of a millstonewill not be heard in you any longer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the light of a lampwill not shine in you any longer;and the voice of the bridegroom and bridewill not be heard in you any longer;for your merchants were the great men of the earth,because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,and of all who have been slain on the earth.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
