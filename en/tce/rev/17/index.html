When I saw her, I wondered greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the angel said to me, »Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go to destruction. And those who dwell on the earth, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will wonder when they see the beast, because he was and is not and will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they are also seven kings; five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The beast who was, and is not, is an eighth. He belongs to the seven and he goes to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These have one purpose and they give their power and authority to the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These will make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those who are with him are the called and chosen and faithful.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to me, »The waters you saw where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the ten horns you saw, they and the beast will hate the harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The woman that you saw is the great city which has dominion over the kings of the earth.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
