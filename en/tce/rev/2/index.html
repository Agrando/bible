I know that you cannot bear evil men, but you have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and have found them to be false;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I know you have persevered and have endured for my name's sake, and you have not grown weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I have this against you, that you have left your first love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember then from where you have fallen, repent and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes, I will give the right to eat from the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: These are the words of the First and the Last, who died, and came to life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and I know the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful even until death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These are the words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know your works, and where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. And you hold fast to my name, and did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat food sacrificed to idols and to practice sexual immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So you also have those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent therefore, or else I will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give some of the hidden manna. And I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone which no one knows except him who receives it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bronze:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know your works, your love and faith, your service and perseverance, and that your works are now more than at the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and beguiling my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So I will cast her on a sickbed, and I will throw those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will strike her children dead. And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each of you according to your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I will not lay upon you any other burden;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>only hold fast what you have until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who overcomes, and keeps my works until the end, to him I will give power over the nations</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»He shall rule them with a rod of iron;as when potters vessels are broken in pieces«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>just as I also have received from my Father; and I will give him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
