He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems; and he has a name written on him which no one knows but himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The armies of heaven were following him, riding on white horses, and dressed in fine linen, white and clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron; he treads the wine press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he has on his robe and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he cried to all the birds that fly in midheaven, »Come, gather for the great supper of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who sits on the horse and against his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who had performed the signs in his presence, by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image.
