And he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death will be no more, neither will there be mourning nor crying nor pain any more, for the former things have passed away.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he who sits on the throne said, »Behold, I am making all things new.« And he said, »Write this, for these words are trustworthy and true.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he said to me, »It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give to the one who is thirsty from the spring of the water of life without cost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who overcomes will inherit all this, and I will be his God and he will be my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But as for the cowardly, the unbelieving, the immoral, as for murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their lot will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues, and spoke to me, saying, »Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>having the glory of God, and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The one who talked with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as the width; and he measured the city with the rod, twelve thousand stadia; its length and width and height are equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He also measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits by a man's measure, which is also an angel's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The wall was made of jasper, and the city of pure gold, as clear as glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The nations will walk by its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the daytime (for there will be no night there) its gates will never be shut;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>they will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nothing unclean shall enter it, nor any one who practices abomination or falsehood, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
