And I saw a beast coming out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on his horns, and on his heads were blasphemous names.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The beast that I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>One of its heads seemed to have a fatal wound, but its fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth followed the beast with wonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Men worshipped the dragon, because he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshipped the beast, saying, »Who is like the beast, and who can make war against him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the beast was given a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Also it was given power to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and tongue and nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and all who dwell on earth will worship it, every one whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb that was slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If anyone has an ear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If anyone is destined for captivity,to captivity he goes;if anyone kills with the sword,with the sword he must be killed. Here is the endurance and faith of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He performs great signs, even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in the sight of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which he was given power to do in the presence of the beast. He ordered them to make an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should even speak, and to cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to be given a mark on their right hand or the forehead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This calls for wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; its number is six hundred and sixty-six.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
