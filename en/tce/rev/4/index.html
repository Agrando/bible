And the voice, which I had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, »Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>At once I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was standing in heaven, with one sitting on the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he who sat there was like jasper and carnelian in appearance, and round the throne was a rainbow that looked like an emerald.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Round the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, and golden crowns on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>From the throne come flashes of lightning, and voices and peals of thunder. And before the throne were seven lamps of fire, which are the seven spirits of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.
