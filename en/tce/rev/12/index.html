And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child when it was born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up to God and to his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which to be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but they were not strong enough, and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole worldhe was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, »Now the salvation, and the power,and the kingdom of our Godand the authority of his Christ have come,for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down,who accuses them before our Godday and night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They overcame him by the blood of the Lamband by the word of their testimony,and they did not love their lives even to the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Rejoice then, O heavensand you that dwell in them!But woe to the earth and the sea,for the devil has come down to youin great wrath,because he knows that his time is short!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is to be nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with the flood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon had poured out of his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
