Instead, they have the power of God to demolish fortresses. We tear down arguments</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and every proud obstacle that is raised against the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive in order to obey Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are ready to punish every act of disobedience when your obedience is complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Look at the plain facts! If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should remind himself of this: Just as he belongs to Christ, so do we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So if I boast a little too much about our authority, which the Lord gave us to build you up and not to tear you down, I will not be ashamed of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I do not want you to think that I am trying to frighten you with my letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For someone is saying, “His letters are impressive and forceful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Someone like this should take note of the following: What we say by letter when we are absent is what we will do when present!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We would not dare put ourselves in the same class with or compare ourselves to those who recommend themselves. When they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves to themselves, they show how foolish they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We will not boast about what cannot be evaluated. Instead, we will stay within the field that God assigned us, so as to reach even you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is not as though we were overstepping our limits when we came to you. We were the first to reach you with the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We are not boasting about the work done by others that cannot be evaluated. On the contrary, we cherish the hope that your faith may continue to grow and enlarge our sphere of action among you until it overflows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then we can preach the gospel in the regions far beyond you without boasting about things already accomplished by someone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>“The person who boasts must boast in the Lord.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is not the person who commends himself who is approved, but the person whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
