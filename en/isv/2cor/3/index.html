Unlike some people, we do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, do we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You are our letter, written in our hearts and known and read by everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You are demonstrating that you are Christ's letter, produced by our service, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Such is the confidence that we have in God through Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>By ourselves we are not qualified to claim that anything comes from us. Rather, our credentials come from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who has also qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, which is not written but spiritual, because the written text brings death, but the Spirit gives life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now if the ministry of death that was inscribed in letters of stone came with such glory that the people of Israel could not gaze on Mosesâ€™ face (because the glory was fading away from it),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>will not the Spirit's ministry have even more glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, then the ministry of justification has an overwhelming glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In fact, that which once had glory lost its glory, because the other glory surpassed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For if that which fades away came through glory, how much more does that which is permanent have glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, since we have such a hope, we speak with great boldness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>not like Moses, who kept covering his face with a veil to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of what was fading away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However, their minds were hardened, for to this day the same veil is still there when they read the old covenant. Only in union with Christ is that veil removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Lord's Spirit is, there is freedom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As all of us reflect the glory of the Lord with unveiled faces, we are being transformed into the same image with ever-increasing glory by the Lord's Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
