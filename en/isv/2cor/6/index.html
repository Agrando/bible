Now is the “day of salvation”!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We do not put an obstacle in anyone's way. Otherwise, fault may be found with our ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Instead, in every way we demonstrate that we are God's servants by tremendous endurance in the midst of difficulties, hardships, and calamities;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights, and hunger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>with purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; with the Holy Spirit, genuine love,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>truthful speech, and divine power; through the weapons of righteousness in the right and left hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>through honor and dishonor; through ill repute and good repute; perceived as deceivers and yet true,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>as unknown and yet well-known, as dying and yet—as you see—very much alive, as punished and yet not killed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as sorrowful and yet always rejoicing, as poor and yet enriching many, as having nothing and yet possessing everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We have spoken frankly to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are wide open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We have not cut you off, but you have cut off your own feelings toward us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do us a favor—I ask you as my children—and open wide your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Stop becoming unevenly yoked with unbelievers. What partnership can righteousness have with lawlessness? What fellowship can light have with darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What harmony exists between Christ and Beliar, or what do a believer and an unbeliever have in common?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What agreement can a temple of God make with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said:	“I will live and walk among them.I will be their God,and they will be my people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore,	“Get away from themand separate yourselves from them,”declares the Lord,	“and don't touch anything unclean.Then I will welcome you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will be your Father,and you will be my sons and daughters,”declares the Lord Almighty.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
