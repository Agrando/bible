They gave themselves to the Lord first and then to us, since this was God's will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So we urged Titus to finish this work of kindness among you in the same way that he had started it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Indeed, the more your faith, speech, knowledge, enthusiasm, and love for us increase, the more we want you to be rich in this work of kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am not commanding you but testing the genuineness of your love by the enthusiasm of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Although he was rich, for your sakes he became poor, so that you, through his poverty, might become rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am giving you my opinion on this matter because it will be helpful to you. Last year you were not only willing to do something, but had already started to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now finish doing it, so that your eagerness to undertake it may be matched by its completion, in keeping with what you have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you do not have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Not that others should have relief while you have hardship. Rather, it is a question of fairness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At the present time, your surplus fills their need, so that their surplus may fill your need. In this way things are fair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As it is written,	“The person who had much did not have too much,and the person who had little did not have too little.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But thanks be to God, who placed in the heart of Titus the same dedication to you that I have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He welcomed my request and eagerly went to visit you by his own free will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>With him we have sent the brother who is praised in all the churches for spreading the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>More than that, he has also been selected by the churches to travel with us while we are administering this work of kindness for the glory of the Lord and as evidence of our eagerness to help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We are trying to avoid any criticism of the way we are administering this great undertaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>We intend to do what is right, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>We have also sent with them our brother whom we have often tested in many ways and found to be dedicated. At present he is more dedicated than ever because he has so much confidence in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker on your behalf. Our brothers, emissaries from the churches, are the glory of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore, give to the churches a demonstration of your love and a reason for why we boast about you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
