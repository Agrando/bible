I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know a man in Christ. Fourteen years ago—whether in his body or outside of his body, I do not know, but God knows—that man was snatched away to the third heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I know that this man—whether in his body or outside of his body, I do not know, but God knows—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>was snatched away to Paradise and heard things that cannot be expressed in words, things that no human being has a right even to mention.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will boast about this man, but as for myself I will boast only about my weaknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>However, if I did want to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be telling the truth. But I am not going to do it in order to keep anyone from thinking more of me than what he sees and hears about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To keep me from becoming conceited because of the exceptional nature of these revelations, a thorn was given to me and placed in my body. It was Satan's messenger to keep on tormenting me so that I would not become conceited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I pleaded with the Lord three times to take it away from me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but he has told me,“My grace is all you need, for my power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore, I will most happily boast about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may rest on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That is why I take such pleasure in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and difficulties for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become a fool. You forced me to be one. Really, I should have been commended by you, for I am not in any way inferior to your “super-apostles,” even if I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The signs of an apostle were performed among you with utmost patience—signs, wonders, and works of power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>How were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I did not bother you for help? Forgive me for this wrong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Here I am ready to visit you for a third time, and I will not bother you for help. I do not want your things but you. Children should not have to support their parents, but parents their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will be very glad to spend my money and myself for you. Do you love me less because I love you so much?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Granting that I have not been a burden to you, was I a clever schemer who trapped you by some trick?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I did not take advantage of you through any of the men I sent you, did I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I encouraged Titus to visit you, and I sent along with him the brother you know so well. Titus didn't take advantage of you, did he? We conducted ourselves with the same spirit, didn't we? We took the very same steps, didn't we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have you been thinking all along that we are trying to defend ourselves before you? We are speaking before God in Christ, and everything, dear friends, is meant to build you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I am afraid that I may come and somehow find you not as I want to find you, and that you may find me not as you want to find me. Perhaps there will be quarreling, jealousy, angry feelings, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly conduct.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I am afraid that when I come my God may again humble me before you and that I may have to grieve over many who formerly lived in sin and have not repented of their impurity, sexual immorality, and promiscuity that they once practiced.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
