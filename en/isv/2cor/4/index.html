We do not use trickery or pervert God's word. By clear statements of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are dying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In their case, the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe to keep them from seeing the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For we do not preach ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as merely your servants for Jesus’ sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But we have this treasure in clay jars to show that its extraordinary power comes from God and not from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In every way we're troubled but not crushed, frustrated but not in despair,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>persecuted but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are always carrying around the death of Jesus in our bodies, so that the life of Jesus may be clearly shown in our bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While we are alive, we are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may be clearly shown in our dying bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And so death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now since we have the same spirit of faith in keeping with what is written—“I believed, and so I spoke”—we also believe, and so we speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us to God together with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All this is for your sake so that, as his grace spreads, it will increase the thanksgiving of more and more people to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That's why we are not discouraged. No, even if our outer man is wearing out, our inner man is being renewed day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This light, temporary nature of our suffering is producing for us an eternal weight of glory, far beyond any comparison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because we do not look for things that can be seen but for things that cannot be seen. For things that can be seen are temporary, but things that cannot be seen are eternal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
