Yes, do put up with me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I am jealous of you with God's own jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>However, I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by its tricks, so your minds may somehow be lured away from sincere and pure devotion to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if someone comes along and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached, or should you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you are all too willing to listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I do not think I'm inferior in any way to those “super-apostles.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even though I may be untrained as an orator, I am not so in the field of knowledge. We have made this clear to all of you in every possible way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Did I commit a sin when I humbled myself by proclaiming to you the gospel of God free of charge, so that you could be exalted?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When I was with you and needed something, I did not bother any of you, because our brothers who came from Macedonia supplied everything I needed. I kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and I will continue to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, my boasting will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I will go on doing what I'm doing in order to deny an opportunity to those people who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in the work they are boasting about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Such people are false apostles, dishonest workers who are masquerading as apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder, since Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their doom will match their deeds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will say it again: No one should think that I am a fool. But if you do, then treat me like a fool so that I can also boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When I talk as a confident boaster, I am not talking with the Lord's authority but like a fool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since many people boast in a fleshly way, I will do it, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You are wise, so you will gladly put up with fools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You put up with anyone who makes you his slaves, devours what you have, takes what is yours, orders you around, or slaps your face!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I am ashamed to admit it, but we have been too weak for that. Whatever anyone else dares to claim—I am talking like a fool—I can claim it, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham's descendants? So am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they Christ's servants? I am insane to talk like this, but I am a far better one! I have been involved in far greater efforts, far more imprisonments, countless beatings, and have faced death more than once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Five times I received from the Jews forty lashes minus one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times I was beaten with a stick, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, and I drifted on the sea for a day and a night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have been involved in frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my own people, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the open country, dangers at sea, dangers from false brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, through hunger and thirst, through many periods of fasting, through coldness and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides everything else, I have a daily burden because of my anxiety about all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak without me being weak, too? Who is caused to stumble without me becoming indignant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must boast, I will boast about the things that show how weak I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas put guards around the city of Damascus to catch me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
