We ourselves are perfectly known to God. I hope we are also really known to your consciences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We are not recommending ourselves to you again but are giving you a reason to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who are proud of outward things rather than inward character.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So if we were crazy, it was for God; if we are sane, it is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The love of Christ controls us, for we are convinced of this: that one person died for all people; therefore, all people have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He died for all people, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for the one who died and rose for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then, from now on we do not think of anyone from a human point of view. Even if we did think of Christ from a human point of view, we don't think of him that way any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. Old things have disappeared, and—look!—all things have become new!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All of this comes from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself by not counting their sins against them, and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, we are Christ's representatives, as though God were pleading through us. We plead on Christ's behalf: “Be reconciled to God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>God made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that we might become God's righteousness in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
