For I had confidence in all of you that my gladness would be for all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For I wrote to you out of great sorrow and anguish of heart—along with many tears—not to make you sad but to let you know how much love I have for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if anyone has caused grief, he didn't cause me any grief. To some extent—I don't want to emphasize this too much—it has affected all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This punishment by the majority is severe enough for such a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So forgive and comfort him, or else he will drown in his excessive grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That's why I'm urging you to assure him of your love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I had also written to you to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in every way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When you forgive someone, I do, too. Indeed, what I have forgiven—if there was anything to forgive—I did in the presence of Christ for your benefit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>so that we may not be outsmarted by Satan. After all, we are not unaware of his intentions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When I went to Troas on behalf of the gospel of Christ, a door in fact stood wide open for me in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But my spirit could not find any relief, because I couldn't find Titus, my brother. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But thanks be to God! He always leads us triumphantly in Christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of knowing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To God we are the aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are being lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To some people we are a deadly fragrance, while to others we are a living fragrance. Who is qualified for this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At least we are not commercializing God's word like so many others. Instead, in Christ we speak with sincerity, like people who are sent from God and are accountable to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
