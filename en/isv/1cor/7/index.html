In the same way, a husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but his wife does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do not withhold yourselves from each other unless you agree to do so for a set time in order to devote yourselves to prayer. Then you should come together again so that Satan does not tempt you through your lack of self-control.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I say this as a concession, not as a command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I would like everyone to be like me. However, each person has a special gift from God, one this and another that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say to those who are unmarried, especially to widows: It is good for them to remain like me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>However, if they cannot control themselves, they should get married, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To married people I give this command (not really I, but the Lord): A wife must not leave her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if she does leave him, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. Likewise, a husband must not abandon his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I (not the Lord) say to the rest of you: If a brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is willing to live with him, he must not abandon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if a woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is willing to live with her, she must not abandon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified because of her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him go. In such cases the brother or sister is not bound; God has called you to live in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless, everyone should live the life that the Lord gave him and to which God called him. This is my rule in all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was anyone circumcised when he was called? He should not try to change that. Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called? He should not get circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but obeying God's commandments is everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Everyone should stay in the calling in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that bother you. Of course, if you have a chance to become free, take advantage of the opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lord's free person. In the same way, the free person who has been called is Christ's slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You were bought for a price. Stop becoming slaves of people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brothers, everyone should stay in the calling he was in when called by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins, although I do not have any command from the Lord, I will give you my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In view of the present crisis, I think it is prudent for a man to stay as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Have you been bound to a wife? Stop trying to get free. Have you been freed from a wife? Stop looking for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if you do get married, you have not sinned. And if a virgin gets married, she has not sinned. However, these people will experience distress in the flesh, and I want to spare you that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This is what I mean, brothers: The time has been shortened. From now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and those who mourn as though they did not mourn, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not own a thing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and those who use the things in the world as though they were not dependent on them. For the world in its present form is passing away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I want you to be free from concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, that is, about how he can please the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how he can please his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and so his attention is divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how she can please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I'm saying this for your benefit, not to put a noose around your necks, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If a man thinks he is not behaving properly toward his virgin, and if his passion is too strong and he feels he ought to, let him do what he wants; he isn't sinning. Let them get married.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>However, if a man stands firm in his resolve and feels no necessity but has made up his mind to keep her a virgin, he will be acting appropriately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then the man who marries the virgin acts appropriately, but the man who refrains from marriage does even better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>However, in my opinion she will be happier if she stays as she is. And I think that I, too, have God's Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
