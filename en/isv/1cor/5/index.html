A man is actually living with his father's wife!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And you are being arrogant instead of being filled with grief and seeing to it that the man who did this is removed from among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Even though I am away from you physically, I am with you in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the man who did this, as though I were present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When you are gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus and my spirit and the power of our Lord Jesus are present,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your boasting is not good. You know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough, don't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Get rid of the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are to be free from yeast. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So let us keep celebrating the festival, not with the old yeast or with the yeast of vice and wickedness, but with the bread of purity and truth that has no yeast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I wrote to you in my letter to stop associating with people who are sexually immoral—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or greedy people, robbers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But now I am writing to you to stop associating with any so-called brother if he is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, a slanderer, a drunk, or a robber. With such a person you must even stop eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After all, is it my business to judge outsiders? You are to judge those who are inside, aren't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>God will judge outsiders. “Put that wicked man away from you.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
