If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But at this very time God has arranged the parts, every one of them, in the body just as he wanted to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now if they were all one part, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So there are many parts, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don't need you,” or the head to the feet, “I don't need you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are in fact indispensable,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable are treated with special honor, and we make our less attractive parts more attractive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>However, our attractive parts don't need this. But God has put the body together and has given special honor to the parts that lack it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>so that there might be no disharmony in the body, but that its parts should have the same concern for each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If one part suffers, every part suffers with it. If one part is praised, every part rejoices with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are Christ's body and individual parts of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>God has appointed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then those who perform miracles, those who have gifts of healing, those who help others, administrators, and various kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Not all have the gift of healing, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Keep on desiring the better gifts. And now I will show you the best way of all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
