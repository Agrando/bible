I am an apostle, am I not? I have seen Jesus our Lord, haven't I? You are my work in the Lord, aren't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If I am not an apostle to other people, surely I am one to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This is my defense to those who would examine me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We have the right to eat and drink, don't we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>We have the right to take a believing wife with us like the other apostles, the Lord's brothers, and Cephas, don't we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who would ever go to war at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its grapes? Or who takes care of a flock and does not drink any of its milk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am not saying this on human authority, am I? The law says the same thing, doesn't it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For in the law of Moses it is written, “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” God is not only concerned about oxen, is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Isn't he really speaking on our behalf? Yes, this was written on our behalf, because the one who plows should plow in hope, and the one who threshes should thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap material benefits from you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others enjoy this right over you, don't we have a stronger claim? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we put up with everything in order not to put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple and that those who serve at the altar get their share of its offerings, don't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the same way, the Lord has ordered that those who proclaim the gospel should make their living from the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have not used any of these rights, and I'm not writing this so that they may be applied in my case. I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my reason for boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast about, for this obligation has been laid on me. How terrible it would be for me if I didn't preach the gospel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I do this voluntarily, I get a reward, but if I am unwilling to do it, I am still entrusted with an obligation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What, then, is my reward? It's to be able to preach the gospel free of charge, and so never resort to using my rights in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Although I am free from all people, I made myself a slave to all of them to win more of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To the Jews I became like a Jew in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became like a man under the law, in order to win those under the law (although I myself am not under the law).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To those who do not have the law I became like a man who does not have the law, in order to win those who do not have the law (although I am not free from God's law, but am under the law of Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To the weak I became weak in order to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I do all this for the sake of the gospel in order to have a share in its blessings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You know that in a race all the runners run but only one wins the prize, don't you? You must run in such a way that you may be victorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Everyone who enters an athletic contest practices self-control in everything. They do it to win a wreath that dies, but we to win one that never dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That is the way I run, with a clear goal in mind. That is the way I box, not like someone punching the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No, I keep on beating my body and making it my slave so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not somehow be disqualified.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
