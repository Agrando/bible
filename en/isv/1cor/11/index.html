If it is a disgrace for a woman to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A man should not cover his own head, because he exists as God's image and glory. But the woman is man's glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and man was not created for woman, but woman for man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is why a woman should have authority over her own head: because of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man of woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as woman came from man, so man comes through woman. But everything comes from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Decide for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nature itself teaches you neither that it is disgraceful for a man to have long hair</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>nor that hair is a woman's glory, for hair is given as a substitute for coverings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if anyone wants to argue about this, we do not have any custom like this, nor do any of God's churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now I am not praising you in giving you the following instructions. When you gather, it is not for the better but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in the first place, I hear that when you gather as a church there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Of course, there must be factions among you to show which of you are genuine!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you gather in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as you eat, each of you rushes to eat his own supper, and one person goes hungry while another gets drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You have homes in which to eat and drink, don't you? Or do you despise God's church and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you—how the Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took a loaf of bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>gave thanks for it, and broke it in pieces, saying,“This is my body that isfor you. Keep doing this in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He did the same with the cup after the supper, saying,“This cup is the new covenant in my blood. As often as you drink from it, keep doing this in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks from the cup in an unworthy manner will be held responsible for the Lord's body and blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A person must examine himself and then eat the bread and drink from the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the one who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That's why so many of you are weak and sick and a considerable number are dying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we judged ourselves correctly, we would not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now, while we are being judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined lest we be condemned along with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, my brothers, when you gather to eat, wait for each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you gather it may not bring judgment on you. And when I come I will give instructions concerning the other matters.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
