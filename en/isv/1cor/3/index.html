Why, you're still not ready for it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>That's because you are still worldly. As long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, you are worldly and living by human standards, aren't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For when one says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,” you are merely human, aren't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>What is Apollos anyhow? Or what is Paul? Mere servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord gave to each of us his task.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God kept everything growing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is significant, but God, who keeps everything growing, is the one who matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The one who plants and the one who waters have the same goal, and each will receive a reward for his own work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are God's co-workers. You are God's farmland and God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As an expert builder using the grace that God gave me, I laid the foundation, and someone else is building on it. But each person must be careful how he builds on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After all, no one can lay any other foundation than the one that is already laid, and that is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whether a person builds on this foundation with gold, silver, expensive stones, wood, hay, or straw,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the workmanship of each person will become evident, for the day will show what it is, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If what a person has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If his work is burned up, he will suffer loss. However, he himself will be saved, but it will be like going through fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You know that you are God's sanctuary and that God's Spirit lives in you, don't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone destroys God's sanctuary, God will destroy him, for God's sanctuary is holy. And you are that sanctuary!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in the ways of this world, he must become a fool to become really wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is nonsense in God's sight. For it is written,	“He catches the wise with their own trickery,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and again,	“The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So let no one boast about men. For everything belongs to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>whether Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, the present, or the future—everything belongs to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
