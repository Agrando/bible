Then you can send me on my way, wherever I decide to go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I do not want to see you now just in passing, because I hope to spend some time with you if the Lord permits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>However, I will be staying on in Ephesus until Pentecost,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>because a door has opened wide for me to do effective work, although many people are opposing me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If Timothy comes, see to it that he does not have anything to be afraid of while he is with you, for he is doing the Lord's work as I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, no one should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me, because I am expecting him along with the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but he was not inclined to go just now. However, he will come when the time is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remain alert. Keep standing firm in your faith. Keep on being courageous and strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Everything you do should be done in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now I urge you, brothers—for you know that the members of the family of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to serving the saints—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to submit yourselves to people like these and to anyone else who shares their labor and hard work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus came here, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They refreshed my spirit—and yours, too. Therefore, appreciate men like that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The churches in Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca and the church in their house greet you warmly in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If anyone doesn't love the Lord, let him be condemned! May our Lord come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My love is with all of you in Christ Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
