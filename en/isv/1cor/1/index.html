Paul wasn't crucified for you, was he? You weren't baptized in Paul's name, were you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Chrispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>lest anyone can say that you were baptized in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(Yes, I also baptized the family of Stephanus. Beyond that, I'm not sure whether I baptized anyone else.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the message about the cross is nonsense to those who are being destroyed, but it is God's power to us who are being saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written,	“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the intelligence of the intelligent I will reject.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? God has turned the wisdom of the world into nonsense, hasn't he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God decided through the nonsense of our preaching to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jews ask for signs, and Greeks look for wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified. He is a stumbling block to Jews and nonsense to Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is God's power and God's wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For God's nonsense is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is stronger than human strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Brothers, think about your own calling. Not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God chose what is nonsense in the world to make the wise feel ashamed. God chose what is weak in the world to make the strong feel ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God chose what is insignificant in the world, what is despised, what is nothing, in order to destroy what is something,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so that no human being may boast in God's presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It is because of him that you are in union with Christ Jesus, who for us has become wisdom from God, as well as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, as it is written, “The person who boasts must boast in the Lord.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
