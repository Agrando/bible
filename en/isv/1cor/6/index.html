And if the world is going to be ruled by you, can't you handle insignificant cases?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You know that we will rule angels, not to mention things in this life, don't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So if you have cases dealing with this life, why do you appoint as judges people who have no standing in the church?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say this to make you feel ashamed. Has it come to this, that there is not one person among you who is wise enough to settle disagreements between brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Instead, one brother goes to court against another brother, and before unbelievers at that!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The very fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves is already a defeat for you. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Instead, you yourselves practice doing wrong and cheating others, and brothers at that!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God, don't you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>thieves, greedy people, drunks, slanderers, and robbers will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That is what some of you were! But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Everything is permissible for me, but not everything is helpful. Everything is permissible for me, but I will not allow anything to control me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food, but God will put an end to both of them. The body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>God raised the Lord, and by his power he will also raise us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You know that your bodies are parts of Christ, don't you? Should I take the parts of Christ and make them parts of a prostitute? Certainly not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You know that the person who unites himself with a prostitute becomes one body with her, don't you? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the person who unites himself with the Lord becomes one spirit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Keep on running away from sexual immorality. Any other sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the person who sins sexually sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God, don't you? You do not belong to yourselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because you were bought for a price. Therefore, glorify God with your bodies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
