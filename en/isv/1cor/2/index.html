For the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Is there anyone who can understand his own thoughts except by his own inner spirit? In the same way, no one can know the thoughts of God except God's Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now, we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we can understand the things that were freely given to us by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We don't speak about these things in words taught us by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, as we explain spiritual things to spiritual people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A person who isn't spiritual doesn't accept the things of God's Spirit, for they are nonsense to him. He can't understand them because they are spiritually evaluated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The spiritual person evaluates everything but is subject to no one else's evaluation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For	“Who has known the mind of the Lordso that he can advise him?”However, we have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
