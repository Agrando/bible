Instead, I worked harder than all the others—not I, of course, but God's grace that was with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So, whether it was I or they, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if we preach that Christ has been raised from the dead, how can some of you keep claiming there is no resurrection of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if Christ has not been raised, then our message means nothing and your faith means nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In addition, we are found to be false witnesses about God because we testified on God's behalf that he raised Christ—whom he did not raise if in fact it is true that the dead are not raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless and you are still in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes, even those who have died in Christ are lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If we have set our hopes on Christ in this life only, we deserve more pity than any other people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But at this moment Christ stands risen from the dead, the first one offered in the harvest of those who have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also came through a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>However, this will happen to each person in the proper order: first Christ, then those who belong to Christ when he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has done away with every ruler and every authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he must rule until God puts all his enemies under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy to be done away with is death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for “God has put everything under his feet.” Now when he says, “Everything has been put under him,” this clearly excludes the one who put everything under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when everything has been put under him, then the Son himself will also become subject to the one who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, what will those people do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are they being baptized for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why in fact are we being endangered every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I face death every day! That is as certain, brothers, as it is that I am proud of you in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If I have fought with wild animals in Ephesus from merely human motives, what do I get out of it? If the dead are not raised,	“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Stop being deceived:	“Wicked friends lead to evil ends.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Come back to your senses as you should, and stop sinning! For some of you—I say this to your shame—are without a true knowledge of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have when they come back?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You fool! The seed you plant does not come to life unless it dies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and what you plant is not the form that it will be, but a bare kernel, whether it is wheat or something else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives the plant the form he wants it to have, and to each kind of seed its own form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Not all flesh is the same. Humans have one kind of flesh, animals in general have another, birds have another, and fish have still another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of those in heaven is of one kind, and that of those on earth is of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>One kind of splendor belongs to the sun, another to the moon, and still another to the stars. In fact, one star differs from another star in splendor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>This is how it will be at the resurrection of the dead. What is planted is decaying, what is raised cannot decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The body is planted in dishonor but raised in splendor. It is planted in weakness but raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is planted a physical body but raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>This, indeed, is what is written: “The first man, Adam, became a living being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The spiritual does not come first, but the physical and then the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man came from the dust of the earth; the second man came from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Those who are made of the dust are like the man from the dust, those who are heavenly are like the man who is from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Just as we have borne the likeness of the man who was made from dust, we will also bear the likeness of the man from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Brothers, this is what I mean: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and what decays cannot inherit what does not decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Let me tell you a secret. Not all of us will die, but all of us will be changed—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the blinking of an eye, at the sound of the last trumpet. Indeed, that trumpet will sound, and then the dead will be raised never to decay, and we will be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For what is decaying must put on what cannot decay, and what is dying must put on what cannot die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now, when what is decaying puts on what cannot decay, and what is dying puts on what cannot die, then the saying that is written will be fulfilled: “Death has been swallowed up in victory!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>“Where, O death, is your victory?Where, O death, is your sting?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, unmovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that your work isn't wasted in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
