Indeed, no one understands him, because he is speaking secrets in the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the person who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding, encouragement, and comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The person who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but the person who prophesies builds the church up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now I wish that all of you could speak in tongues, but especially that you could prophesy. The person who prophesies is more important than the person who speaks in a tongue, unless he interprets it so that the church may be built up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Indeed, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what good will I be to you unless I speak to you in some revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the same way, lifeless instruments like the flute or harp produce sounds. But if there's no difference in the notes, how can a person tell what tune is being played?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For example, if a bugle doesn't sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In the same way, unless you speak an intelligible message with your tongue, how will anyone know what is being said? You'll be talking into the air!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are, I suppose, many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If I don't know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In the same way, since you're so desirous of spiritual gifts, you must keep on desiring them for the upbuilding of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, the person who speaks in a tongue should pray for the ability to interpret it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is not productive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What does this mean? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing psalms with my spirit, but I will also sing psalms with my mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Otherwise, if you say a blessing with your spirit, how can an otherwise uneducated person say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you're saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It's good for you to give thanks, but it does not build up the other person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But in church I would rather speak five words with my mind to instruct others than 10,000 words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, stop being children in your thinking. In evil be infants, but in thinking be adults.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written,	“Through people of strange tonguesand through the mouths of foreigners	I will speak to this people,but even then they will not listen to me,”declares the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Tongues, then, are meant to be a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers, while prophecy is meant, not for unbelievers, but for believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now if the whole church gathers in the same place and everyone is speaking in tongues, when uneducated people or unbelievers come in, they will say that you are out of your mind, won't they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if everyone is prophesying, when an unbeliever or an uneducated person comes in he will be convicted by all and examined by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The secrets in his heart will become known, and so he will bow down to the ground and worship God, declaring, “God is truly among you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What, then, does this mean, brothers? When you gather, everyone has a psalm, teaching, revelation, tongue, or interpretation. Everything must be done for upbuilding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If anyone speaks in a tongue, only two or three at the most should do so, one at a time, and somebody must interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If an interpreter is not present, he should remain silent in the church and speak to himself and God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If a revelation is made to another person who is seated, the first person should be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For everyone can prophesy in turn, so that everyone can be instructed and everyone can be encouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for God is not a God of disorder but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the women must keep silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak out, but must place themselves in submission, as the law also says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If they want to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is inappropriate for a woman to speak out in church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Did God's word originate with you? Are you the only people it has reached?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If anyone thinks he is a prophet or a spiritual person, he must acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if anyone ignores this, he should be ignored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, my brothers, desire the ability to prophesy, and do not prevent others from speaking in tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But everything must be done in a proper and orderly way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
