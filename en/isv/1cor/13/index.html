Nor is she conceited,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And never is she rude,	Never does she think of self	Or ever get annoyed.	She never is resentful,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is never glad with sin,	But always glad to side with truth,	Whene'er the truth should win.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>She bears up under everything,	Believes the best in all,	There is no limit to her hope,	And never will she fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Love never fails. Now if there are prophecies, they will be done away with. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will be done away with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For what we know is incomplete and what we prophesy is incomplete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when what is complete comes, then what is incomplete will be done away with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, and reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up my childish ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we see only a blurred reflection in a mirror, but then we will see face to face. Now what I know is incomplete, but then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Right now three things remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
