And there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom everything came into being and through whom we live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are so accustomed to idols that they still think they are eating food offered to an idol, and since their conscience is weak, it becomes contaminated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>However, food will not bring us closer to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you must see to it that this right of yours does not become a stumbling block to the weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idol's temple, he will be encouraged to eat what has been offered to idols, won't he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In that case, the weak brother for whom Christ died is destroyed by your knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak consciences, you are sinning against Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, if food causes my brother to fall, I will never eat meat again, in order to keep my brother from falling.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
