He took those charges away when he nailed them to the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had disarmed the rulers and the authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, let no one judge you in matters of food and drink or with respect to a festival, a new moon, or a Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels cheat you out of the prize by boasting about what he has seen. Such a person is puffed up without cause by his carnal mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He does not hold on to the head, from whom the whole body, which is nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that comes from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If you have died with Christ to the basic principles of the world, why are you submitting to its decrees as though you still lived in the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“Don't handle this! Don't taste or touch that!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All of these things will be destroyed through use because they are based on human commands and teachings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These things have the appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion, humility, and harsh treatment of the body, but they have no value against self-indulgence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
