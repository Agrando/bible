God is treating you as sons. Is there a son whom his father does not discipline?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now if you are without any discipline, in which all sons share, then you are illegitimate and not his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Furthermore, we had earthly fathers who used to discipline us, and we respected them for it. We should even more submit to the Father of our spirits and live, shouldn't we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For a short time they disciplined us as they thought best, but he does it for our good, so that we may share in his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, for those who have been trained by it, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, strengthen your tired arms and your weak knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not become worse but rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pursue peace with everyone, as well as holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up and causes you trouble, or many of you will become defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No one should be immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you know that afterwards, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected because he could not find any opportunity to repent, even though he begged for it with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you have not come to something that can be touched, to a blazing fire, to darkness, to gloom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to a trumpet's blast, or to a voice that made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they could not endure the command that was given: “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Indeed, the sight was so terrifying that Moses said, “I am trembling with fear.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, to tens of thousands of angels joyfully gathered together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to a judge who is the God of all, to the spirits of righteous people who have been made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better message than Abel's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See to it that you do not ignore the one who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they ignored the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we turn away from the one who is from heaven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The expression “once more” signifies the removal of what can be shaken, that is, what he has made, so that what cannot be shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful and worship God in reverence and fear in a way that pleases him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For our God is an all-consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
