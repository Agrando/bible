And by faith he continues to speak, even though he is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>By faith Enoch was taken away without experiencing death. He could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he won approval as one who pleased God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who diligently search for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, reverently prepared an ark to save his family, and by it he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he was waiting for the city with permanent foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith Sarah, even though she was old and barren, received the strength to conceive, because she was convinced that the one who had made the promise was faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Abraham was as good as dead, yet from this one man came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All these people died having faith. They did not receive the things that were promised, yet they saw them in the distant future and welcomed them, acknowledging that they were strangers and foreigners on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For people who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If they had been thinking about what they had left behind, they would have had an opportunity to go back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Instead, they were longing for a better country, that is, a heavenly one. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, because he has prepared a city for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac. The man who had received the promises was about to offer his unique son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>about whom it had been said, “It is through Isaac that descendants will be named for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He was certain that God could raise people from the dead, and figuratively speaking he did get him back in this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons “and worshiped while leaning on the top of his staff.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites and gave them instructions about burying his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months after he was born, because they saw that he was a beautiful child and were not afraid of the king's order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>because he preferred being mistreated with God's people to enjoying the pleasures of sin for a short time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He thought that being insulted for the sake of Christ was of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he left Egypt, without being afraid of the king's anger, and he persevered because he saw the one who is invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith he established the Passover and the sprinkling of blood to keep the destroyer of the firstborn from touching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it were dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do this, they were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith Rahab the prostitute did not die with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies with a greeting of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell you about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Through faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice, received promises, shut the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>put out raging fires, escaped death by the sword, found strength in weakness, became powerful in battle, and routed foreign armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received back their dead through a resurrection. Others were brutally tortured but refused to accept release, so that they might gain a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Still others endured taunts and floggings, and even chains and imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned to death, sawed in half, and killed with swords. They went around in sheepskins and goatskins. They were needy, oppressed, and mistreated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The world wasn’t worthy of them. They wandered in deserts, mountains, caves, and holes in the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All these people won approval for their faith but did not receive what was promised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>since God had planned something better for us so that they would not become perfect without us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
