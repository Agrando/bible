It was first proclaimed by the Lord himself, and then it was confirmed to us by those who heard him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>while God added his testimony through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he did not put the coming world we are talking about under the control of angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Instead, someone has declared somewhere,	“What is man that you should remember him,or the son of man that you should care for him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You made him a little lower than the angels,yet you crowned him with glory and honor</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and put everything under his feet.”Now when God put everything under him, he left nothing outside his control. However, at the present time we do not yet see everything put under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we do see someone who was made a little lower than the angels. He is Jesus, who is crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might experience death for everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In bringing many children to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both the one who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified all have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>when he says, “I will announce your name to my brothers. I will praise you within the congregation.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, “I will trust him.” And again, “I am here with the children God has given me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, since the children have flesh and blood, he himself also shared the same things, so that by his death he might destroy the one who has the power of death (that is, the devil)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and might free those who were slaves all their lives because they were terrified by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For it is clear that he did not come to help angels. No, he came to help Abraham's descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus he had to become like his brothers in every way, so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God and could atone for the people's sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
