This was called the Holy Place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Behind the second curtain was the part of the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>which had the gold altar for incense and the ark of the covenant completely covered with gold. In it were the gold jar holding the manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the tablets of the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of atonement. (We cannot discuss these things in detail now.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When everything had been arranged like this, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle to perform their duties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But only the high priest went into the second part, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins committed by the people in ignorance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Holy Spirit was indicating by this that the way into the Holy of Holies had not yet been disclosed as long as the first part of the tabernacle was still standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This is an illustration of the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered could not make the conscience of the worshiper perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>since they deal only with food, drink, and various washings, which are required for the body until the time when things would be set right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not made by human hands and that is not a part of this creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood he went into the Holy of Holies once for all and secured our eternal redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are unclean purifies them with physical cleansing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we may serve the living God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This is why he is the mediator of a new covenant; so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance promised them, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the offenses committed under the first covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For a will is in force only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect as long as the one who made it is alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For after every commandment in the law had been spoken to all the people by Moses, he took the blood of calves and goats, together with some water, scarlet wool, and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God ordained for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In fact, under the law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of the blood there is no forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus it was necessary for the copies of the things in heaven to be cleansed by these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Christ did not go into a sanctuary made by human hands and just a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in God's presence on our behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nor did he go into heaven to sacrifice himself again and again, the way the high priest goes into the Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now, at the end of the ages, he has appeared once for all to remove sin by his sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Indeed, just as people are appointed to die once and after that to be judged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people. And he will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly wait for him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
