For God will judge those who commit sexual sins, especially those who commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you have, for God has said, “I will never leave you or abandon you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hence we can confidently say, “The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember your leaders, those who have spoken God's word to you. Think about the impact of their lives, and imitate their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today—and forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Stop being carried away by all kinds of unusual teachings, for it is good that the heart be strengthened by grace, not by food laws that have never helped those who follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We have an altar, and those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the bodies of animals, whose blood is taken into the sanctuary by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>That is why Jesus, in order to sanctify the people by his own blood, also suffered outside the city gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore go to him outside the camp and endure the insults he endured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For here we have no permanent city but are looking for the one that is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, through him let us always bring God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not neglect to do good and to be generous, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Continue to obey your leaders and to be submissive to them, for they watch over your souls as men who will have to give a word of explanation. Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for that would be harmful to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I especially ask you to do this so that I may be brought back to you sooner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now may the God of peace, who by the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the Great Shepherd of the sheep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>equip you with everything good to do his will, accomplishing in us what pleases him through Jesus Christ. To him be glory forever and ever! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I urge you, brothers, to listen patiently to my encouraging message, for I have written you a short letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You should know that our brother Timothy has been set free. If he comes soon, he will be with me when I see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who are from Italy greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>May grace be with all of you!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
