After he had provided a cleansing from sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Highest Majesty</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is better than theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son”?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And again, when he brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all God's angels worship him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now about the angels he says, 	“He makes his angels winds,and his servants flames of fire.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But about the Son he says,	“Your throne, O God,is forever and ever,	and the scepter of your kingdomis a righteous scepter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You have loved righteousnessand hated wickedness.	That is why God, your God,anointed you rather than your companionswith the oil of gladness.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And,	“In the beginning, Lord,you laid the foundation of the earth,and the heavens are the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They will come to an end,but you will remain forever.They will all wear out like clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You will roll them up like a robe,and they will be changed like clothes.	But you remain the same,and your years will never end.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But to which of the angels did he ever say,	“Sit at my right handuntil I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All of them are spirits on a divine mission, sent to serve those who are about to inherit salvation, aren't they?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
