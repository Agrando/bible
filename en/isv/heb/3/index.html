That is why I was indignant with that generation and said,‘They are always going astray in their hearts,and they have not known my ways.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So in my anger I swore a solemn oaththat they would never enter my rest.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>See to it, my brothers, that no evil, unbelieving heart is found in any of you, as shown by your turning away from the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Instead, continue to encourage one another every day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we are Christ's partners only if we hold on to our original confidence to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As it is said,	“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as they didwhen they provoked me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now who heard him and provoked him? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned and whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest, if not to those who disobeyed him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So we see that they were unable to enter because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
