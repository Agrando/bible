No, it was God who said to him,	“You are my Son.Today I have become your Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As he also says in another place,	“You are a priest foreveraccording to the order of Melchizedek.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the days of his flesh, he offered up prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his devotion to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Son though he was, he learned obedience through his sufferings</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>having been designated by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We have much to say about this, but it is difficult to explain because you have become too lazy to understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In fact, though by now you should be teachers, you still need someone to teach you the basic truths of God's word. You have become people who need milk instead of solid food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For everyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is inexperienced in the message of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But solid food is for mature people, whose minds are trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
