For he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“This is the covenant that I will make with themafter those days, declares the Lord:	I will put my laws in their heartsand will write them on their minds,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and,	“I will never again remember their sinsand their lawless deeds.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now where there is forgiveness of these sins, there is no longer any offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, my brothers, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and since we have a great high priest over the household of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us continue to come near with sincere hearts in full assurance of faith, because our hearts have been sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies have been washed with pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us continue to hold firmly to the hope that we confess without wavering, for the one who made the promise is faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let us continue to consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another even more as you see the day coming nearer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we choose to go on sinning after we have received the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but only a terrifying prospect of judgment and a raging fire that will consume the enemies of God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Anyone who violates the law of Moses dies without mercy “on the testimony of two or three witnesses.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>How much more severe a punishment do you think that person deserves who tramples on God's Son, treats as common the blood of the covenant by which it was sanctified, and insults the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know the one who said, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay them back,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But you must continue to remember those earlier days, how after you were enlightened you endured a hard and painful struggle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>At times you were made a public spectacle through insults and persecutions, while at other times you associated with people who were treated this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For you sympathized with the prisoners and cheerfully submitted to the violent seizure of your property, because you know that you have a better and more permanent possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So do not throw away your confidence, since it holds a great reward for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For you need endurance, so that after you have done God's will you can receive what he has promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For	“in a very little whilethe one who is coming will returnand will not delay;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but my righteous one will live by faith,and if he turns back,my soul will take no pleasure in him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now, we do not belong to those who turn back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
