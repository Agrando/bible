Therefore, this high priest had to offer something too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because other men offer the gifts prescribed by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They serve in a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly one. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>However, Jesus has now obtained a ministry that is as superior to theirs as the covenant he mediates is founded on better promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But God found something wrong with his people when he said,	“Look! The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenantwith the house of Israeland with the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors at the timewhen I took them by the handand brought them out of the land of Egypt. 	Because they did not remain loyal to my covenant,I ignored them, declares the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israelafter those days, declares the Lord:	I will put my laws in their mindsand write them on their hearts.	I will be their God,and they will be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Never again will everyone teach his neighbor or his brother by saying, ‘Know the Lord,’	because all of them will know me,from the least important to the most important.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will be merciful regarding their wrong deeds,and I will never again remember their sins.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In speaking of a “new” covenant, he has made the first one obsolete, and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
