In the first place, his name means “king of righteousness,” and then he is also king of Salem, that is, “king of peace.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He has no father, mother, or genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life. Like the Son of God, he continues to be a priest forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Just look at how great this man was! Even Abraham—the patriarch himself—gave him a tenth of what he had captured!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The descendants of Levi who accept the priesthood have a commandment in the law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their own brothers, even though they are also descendants of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this man, whose descent is not traced from them, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the man who had received the promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It is beyond dispute that the less important person is blessed by the more important person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The men who collect the tenth die, but we are told that he keeps on living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now if perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—for on this basis the people received the law—what further need would there be to speak of appointing another kind of priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not one according to the order of Aaron?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For when a change in the priesthood takes place, there must also be a change in the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the person we are talking about belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is obvious that our Lord was a descendant of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This point is even more obvious in that another priest who is like Melchizedek has appeared</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who was appointed to be a priest, not on the basis of a regulation concerning his ancestry, but rather on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is declared about him,	“You are a priest foreveraccording to the order of Melchizedek.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Indeed, the cancellation of the former regulation has occurred because it was weak and ineffective</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we approach God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now none of this happened without an oath. Others became priests without any oath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but Jesus became a priest with an oath when God said to him,	“The Lord has taken an oathand will not change his mind.	You are a priest forever.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In this way, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>There have been many priests, since they have been prevented by death from continuing in office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, because he always lives to intercede for them, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>We need such a high priest—one who is holy, innocent, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He has no need to offer sacrifices every day like those high priests, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he sacrificed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
