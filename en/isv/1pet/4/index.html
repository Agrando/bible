For the person who has suffered in the sphere of the flesh has stopped sinning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>so that he can live the rest of his time in the flesh guided, not by human desires, but by the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For you spent enough time in the past doing what the Gentiles like to do, living in sensuality, sinful desires, drunkenness, wild celebrations, drinking parties, and detestable idolatry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They insult you now because they are surprised that you are no longer joining them in the same excesses of wild living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Indeed, this is why the gospel was proclaimed even to those who have died, so that they could be judged in the realm of the flesh like all humans and live in the realm of the spirit like God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The end of everything is near; so be sensible and clear-headed for the sake of your prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Above all, continue to love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Show hospitality to one another without complaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As good managers of God's grace in its various forms, serve one another with the gift each of you has received.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whoever speaks must speak God's words. Whoever serves must serve with the strength that God supplies, so that in every way God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. Glory and power belong to him forever and ever! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Dear friends, do not be surprised by the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Instead, because you are participating in the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that you may be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed, for the glorious Spirit of God is resting on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Of course, none of you should suffer for being a murderer, thief, criminal, or troublemaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if you suffer for being a Christian, do not feel ashamed, but glorify God with that name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. And if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who refuse to obey the gospel of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“If it is hard for the righteous person to be saved,what will happen to the ungodly and sinful person?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then, those who suffer according to God's will should entrust their souls to a faithful Creator and continue to do what is good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
