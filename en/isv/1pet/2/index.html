I am laying a chosenand precious cornerstone in Zion.			The one who believes in him will never be ashamed.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore he is precious to you who believe, but to those who do not believe,	“The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>a stone they stumble over and a rock they trip on.”They keep on stumbling because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people to be his very own and to proclaim the wonderful deeds of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Once you were not a people,but now you are the people of God.	Once you had not received mercy,but now you have received mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Dear friends, I urge you as aliens and exiles to keep on abstaining from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Continue to live such upright lives among the Gentiles that, when they slander you as evildoers, they may see your good works and glorify God when he visits them in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the Lord's sake submit yourselves to every human authority: whether to the king as supreme,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Live like free people, and do not use your freedom as an excuse for doing evil. Instead, be God's servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Show honor to everyone. Keep on loving the brothers, fearing God, and honoring the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You household servants must submit yourselves to your masters with all fear, not only to those who are kind and fair, but also to those who are unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is a fine thing if, when moved by your conscience to please God, you suffer patiently when wronged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>What credit is it if you sin and patiently receive a beating for it? But if you suffer for doing good and take it patiently, you have God's approval.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is, in fact, what you were called to do, because Christ also suffered for you and left an example for you to follow in his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>“He never committed a sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he was insulted, he did not retaliate. When he suffered, he did not threaten but made it his habit to commit the matter to the one who judges fairly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to those sins and live for righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were like sheep that kept going astray, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
