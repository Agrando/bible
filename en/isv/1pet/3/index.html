They submitted themselves to their husbands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You have become her daughters by doing good and by not letting anything terrify you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In a similar way, you husbands must live with your wives in an understanding manner, as with a most delicate vessel. Honor them as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing may interfere with your prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, all of you must live in harmony, be sympathetic, love as brothers, and be compassionate and humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not pay others back evil for evil or insult for insult. Instead, bless them, because you were called to inherit a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For	“the person who wants to love lifeand see good days	must keep his tongue from eviland his lips from speaking deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He must turn away from evil and do good.He must seek peace and pursue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,and his ears are attentive to their prayer.	But the face of the Lord is against those who do wrong.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who will harm you if you are devoted to doing what is good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But even if you should suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. Never be afraid of their threats, and never get upset.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead, exalt Christ as Lord in your hearts. Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you to explain the hope you have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak evil of your good conduct in Christ will be ashamed of slandering you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>After all, if it is the will of God, it is better to suffer for doing right than for doing wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, an innocent person for the guilty, so that he could bring you to God. He was put to death in the sphere of the flesh but was made alive in the sphere of the spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which he went and made a proclamation to those imprisoned spirits</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who disobeyed long ago in the days of Noah, when God waited patiently while the ark was being built. In it a few, that is, eight persons, were saved by water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Baptism, which is symbolized by that water, now saves you also, not by removing dirt from the body, but by asking God for a clear conscience based on the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who has gone to heaven and is at the right hand of God, where angels, authorities, and powers have been made subject to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
