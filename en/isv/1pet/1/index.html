May grace and peace be yours in abundance!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Because of his great mercy he has given us a new birth to an ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and to an inheritance kept in heaven for you that can't be destroyed, corrupted, or changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Through faith you are being protected by God's power for a salvation that is ready to be revealed at the end of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you have to suffer various kinds of trials,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so that the genuineness of your faith, which is more valuable than gold that perishes when it is tested by fire, may result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though you have not seen him, you love him. And even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even the prophets, who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours, carefully researched and investigated this salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They tried to find out what era or specific time the Spirit of Christ in them kept referring to when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you in regard to the things that have now been announced to you by those who brought you the good news through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. These are things that even the angels desire to look into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep a clear head, and set your hope completely on the grace to be given you when Jesus Christ is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As obedient children, do not be shaped by the desires that you once had in your ignorance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead, just as the one who called you is holy, be holy in every aspect of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For it is written, “You must be holy, because I am holy.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you call “Father” the one who judges everyone impartially according to what he has done, you must live in the fear of the Lord as long as you are strangers here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you know that it was not with perishable things like silver or gold that you have been ransomed from the worthless way of life handed down to you by your ancestors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or defect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On the one hand, he was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but on the other hand, he was revealed at the end of time for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now that you have obeyed the truth and have purified your souls to love your brothers sincerely, you must love one another intensely and with a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For you have been born again, not by a seed that perishes but by one that cannot perish—by the living and everlasting word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For	“All human life is like grass,and all its glory is like a flower in the grass.	The grass dries up and the flower drops off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but the word of the Lord lasts forever.”Now this word is the good news that was announced to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
