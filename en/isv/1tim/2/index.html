There is also one mediator between God and human beingsâ€”a human, Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He gave himself as a ransom for all, a fact that was acknowledged at the right time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For this reason I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. (I am telling you the truth. I am not lying.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore, I want the men to offer prayers in every place, lifting up holy hands without being angry or argumentative.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Women, for their part, should display their beauty by dressing modestly and decently in appropriate clothes, not by braiding their hair or by wearing gold, pearls, or expensive clothes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but through good works. This is proper for women who claim to have reverence for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A woman must learn quietly with full submission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover, I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man. Instead, she is to be quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was not Adam who was deceived. It was the woman who was deceived and became a lawbreaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>However, women will be saved by having children, if they continue to have faith, love, and holiness, along with good judgment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
