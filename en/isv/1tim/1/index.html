May grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be yours!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When I was on my way to Macedonia, I urged you to stay in Ephesus so that you could instruct certain people to stop teaching false doctrine</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and occupying themselves with myths and endless genealogies. These things promote controversies rather than God's ongoing purpose, which involves faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The goal of this instruction is love that flows from a pure heart, from a clear conscience, and from a sincere faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Some people have left these qualities behind and have turned to fruitless discussion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They want to be teachers of the law, yet they do not understand either what they are talking about or the things about which they speak so confidently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Of course, we know that the law is good if a person uses it legitimately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that is, if he understands that the law is not intended for righteous people but for lawbreakers and rebels, for ungodly people and sinners, for those who are unholy and irreverent, for those who kill their fathers, their mothers, or other people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for those involved in sexual immorality, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for false witnesses, and for whatever else goes against the healthy teaching</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who gives me strength, that he has considered me faithful and has appointed me to his service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the past I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man. But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in my unbelief,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the grace of our Lord overflowed toward me, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This saying is trustworthy and deserves complete acceptance:	To this world Christ Jesus came,Sinful people to reclaim.I am the worst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the worst sinner, Christ Jesus might demonstrate all of his patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now to the King Eternal—the immortal, invisible, and only God—be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Timothy, my child, I am giving you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies made earlier about you, so that by following them you may continue to fight the good fight</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>with faith and a good conscience. By ignoring their consciences, some people have destroyed their faith like a wrecked ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These include Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
