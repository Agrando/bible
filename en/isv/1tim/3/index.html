He must not be argumentative or a lover of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He must manage his own family well and have children who are submissive and respectful in every way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if a man does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He must not be a recent convert, or he might become arrogant and fall into the condemnation of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He must be well thought of by outsiders, lest he fall into disgrace and the trap set for him by the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Deacons, too, must be serious.

They must not be gossips, but instead be stable and trustworthy in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Deacons must be husbands of one wife and must manage their children and their families well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Those deacons who serve well gain an excellent reputation for themselves and will have great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I hope to come to you soon. However, I'm writing this to you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>in case I am delayed so that you may know how one is to behave in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By common confession, the secret of our godly worship is great:	In flesh was he revealed to sight,Kept righteous by the Spirit's might,Adored by angels singing.	To nations was he manifest,Believing souls found peace and rest,Our Lord in heaven reigning!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
