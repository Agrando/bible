Instead, they must serve them even better, because those who benefit from their service are believers and dear to them. These are the things you must teach and exhort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anyone teaches false doctrine and refuses to agree with the healthy words of our Lord Jesus Christ and godly teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is a conceited person and does not understand anything. He has an unhealthy craving for arguments and debates. This produces jealousy, rivalry, slander, evil suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and incessant conflict between people who are depraved in mind and deprived of truth. They think that godliness is a way to make a profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Of course, godliness with contentment does bring a great profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we did not bring anything into the world, and surely we cannot take anything out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So as long as we have food and clothes, we will be satisfied with these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But people who want to get rich keep toppling into temptation and are trapped by many stupid and harmful desires that plunge them into destruction and ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, in their eagerness to get rich, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with much pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you, man of God, must flee from all these things. Instead, you must pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight for the faith. Keep your hold on eternal life, to which you were called and about which you gave a good testimony in front of many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and in the sight of Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate, I solemnly charge you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>to keep this command stainless and blameless until the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At the right time God will make him known. He is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He alone has endless life and lives in inaccessible light. No one has ever seen him, nor can anyone see him. Honor and eternal power belong to him! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell those who are rich in the present world not to be arrogant and not to place their confidence in anything as uncertain as riches. Instead, let them place their confidence in God, who lavishly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, and to share.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By doing this they store up a treasure for themselves that is a good foundation for the future, so that they can take hold of the life that is real.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the pointless discussions and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Although some claim to have it, they have abandoned the faith. May grace be with all of you!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
