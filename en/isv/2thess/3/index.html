We did not live in idleness among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We did not eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead, with toil and labor we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It is not as though we did not have that right, but, we wanted to give you an example to follow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>While we were with you, we gave this order: “If anyone doesn't want to work, he shouldn't eat.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We hear that some of you are living in idleness.

May the Lord be with all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand. This is the mark in every letter of mine.
