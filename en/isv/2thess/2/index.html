As a result, he seats himself in the sanctuary of God and declares himself to be God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Don't you remember that I repeatedly told you about these things when I was still with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You know what it is that is now holding him back, so that he will be revealed when his time comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the secret of this lawlessness is already at work, but only until the person now holding it back gets out of the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the breath of his mouth, rendering him powerless by the manifestation of his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The coming of the lawless one will be accompanied by the power of Satan. He will use every kind of power, including miraculous signs, lying wonders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and every type of evil to deceive those who are dying, those who refused to love the truth that would save them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this reason, God will send them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all who have not believed the truth but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At all times we are obligated to thank God for you, brothers who are loved by the Lord, because God chose you to be the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through faith in the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With this purpose in mind, he called you through our proclamation of the gospel so that you would obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So then, brothers, stand firm, and cling to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by our letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
