May grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be yours!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I constantly thank my God—whom I serve with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did—when I remember you in my prayers night and day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>recalling your tears and longing to see you so that I can be filled with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am reminded of your sincere faith, which lived first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced that this faith also lives in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this reason, I am reminding you to fan into flames the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but one of power, love, and self-discipline.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore, never be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me, his prisoner. Instead, by God's power, join me in suffering for the sake of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our own works but according to his own purpose and the grace that was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now, however, it has been revealed through the coming of our Savior Christ Jesus, who has destroyed death and through the gospel has brought life and release from death into full view.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the sake of this gospel I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>That is why I suffer as I do. However, I am not ashamed, for I know the one in whom I have put my trust, and I'm convinced that he is able to protect what he has entrusted to me until that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hold on to the pattern of healthy teachings that you have heard from me, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us, protect the good treasure that has been entrusted to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You know that everyone in Asia has abandoned me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, for he often took care of me and was not ashamed that I was a prisoner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Instead, when he arrived in Rome he searched diligently for me and found me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>May the Lord grant that he finds mercy from the Lord on that day.
