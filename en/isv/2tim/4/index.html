Be ready to do this whether or not the time is convenient. Refute, warn, and encourage with the utmost patience when you teach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the time will come when people will not put up with healthy doctrine but with itching ears will surround themselves with teachers who cater to their own needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They will refuse to listen to the truth and will turn to myths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you must be clear-headed about everything. Endure suffering. Do the work of an evangelist. Devote yourself completely to your ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I am already being poured out as an offering, and the time for my departure has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have fought the good fight. I have completed the race. I have kept the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The victor's crown of righteousness is now waiting for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who eagerly wait for his appearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do your best to come to me soon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Demas, having fallen in love with this present world, has abandoned me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful in my ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When you come, bring the coat I left with Carpus in Troas, as well as the scrolls and especially the parchments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will pay him back for what he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You, too, must watch out for him, for he violently opposed our message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At my first trial no one came to my defense. Everyone abandoned me. May it not be held against them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>However, the Lord stood by me and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles could hear it. I was rescued out of a lion's mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will take me safely to his heavenly kingdom. Glory belongs to him forever and ever! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Greet Prisca and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do your best to come to me before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>May the Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with all of you! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
