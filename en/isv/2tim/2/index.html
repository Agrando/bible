The Lord will help you to understand all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Meditate on Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead and is a descendant of David. This is the gospel I tell others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Because of it I am experiencing trouble, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. However, God's word is not chained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For that reason, I endure everything for the sake of those who have been chosen so that they, too, may receive the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, along with eternal glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This saying is trustworthy:	In dying with Christ,true life we gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Enduring, we with him shall reign.Who him denies,he will disclaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Our faith may fail,his never wanes—	For thus he is,he cannot change!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remind others about these things, and warn them in the sight of God not to argue over words. Arguing does not do any good but only destroys those who are listening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do your best to present yourself to God as an approved worker who has nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of truth with precision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>However, avoid pointless discussions. For people will become more and more ungodly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and what they say will spread everywhere like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They have abandoned the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place, and so they destroy the faith of others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However, God's solid foundation still stands. It has this inscription on it: “The Lord knows those who belong to him,” and “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from evil.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a large house there are not only utensils made of gold and silver, but also those made of wood and clay. Some are for special use, while others are for ordinary use.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, if anyone stops associating with these people, he will become a special utensil, set apart for the owner's use, prepared for every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Flee from youthful passions. Instead, pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace together with those who call on the Lord with a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do not have anything to do with foolish and stupid discussions, because you know they breed arguments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A servant of the Lord must not argue. Instead, he must be kind to everyone, teachable, willing to suffer wrong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and gentle in refuting his opponents. After all, maybe God will allow them to repent and to come to a full knowledge of the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that they might escape from the devil's snare, even though they've been held captive by him to do his will.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
