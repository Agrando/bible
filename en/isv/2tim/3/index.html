Stay away from such people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For some of these men go into homes and deceive foolish women who are burdened with sins and swayed by all kinds of desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>These women are always studying but are never able to arrive at a full knowledge of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men oppose the truth. They are depraved in mind and their faith is a counterfeit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those two men, their stupidity will be plain to everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But you have observed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Indeed, all who want to live a godly life in union with Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse as they deceive others and are themselves deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But as for you, continue in what you have learned and found to be true, because you know from whom you learned it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures that are able to give you the wisdom you need for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that the man of God may be complete and thoroughly equipped for every good work.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
