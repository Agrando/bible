He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the wine press, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>At the right time he sent a servant to the farmers to collect from them a share of the produce from the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the farmersgrabbed the servant,beat him, and sent him back empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again, the mansent another servant to them. They beat the servantover the head and treated him shamefully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the mansent another, and that one they killed. So it was with many other servants.Some of these they beat, and others they killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Hestill had one more person to send,a son whom he loved. Finally, he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But those farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come on, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they grabbed him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>“Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers and give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Haven't you ever read this Scripture:‘The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This was the Lord's doing,and it is amazing in our eyes’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They were trying to arrest him but were afraid of the crowd. Realizing that he had spoken this parable against them, they left him alone and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they sent some Pharisees and some Herodians to him, intending to trap him in what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere. You don't favor any individual, for you pay no attention to external appearance. Rather, you teach the way of God truthfully. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or should we not?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus recognized their hypocrisy and said to them,“Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me see it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they brought one. Then he asked them,“Whose face and name is this?”They said to him, “Caesar's.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Jesus said to them,“Give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” And they were utterly amazed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, he should marry the widow and have children for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There were seven brothers. The first one married and died without having children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the second married her and died without having children, and so did the third.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>None of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since the seven had married her?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus said to them,“Aren't you mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For when peoplerise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As for the dead being raised, haven't you read in the book of Moses, in the story about the bush, how God said, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Heis not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then one of the scribes came near and heard them arguing with one another. He saw how well Jesus answered them, so he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of them all?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered,“The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The second is this: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’No other commandment is greater than these.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the scribe said to him, “Well said, Teacher! You have told the truth that ‘God is one, and there is no other besides him.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When Jesus saw how wisely the man answered, he told him,“You are not far from the kingdom of God.” After that, no one dared to ask him another question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While Jesus was teaching in the temple, he said,“How can the scribes say that the Christis David's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>David himself said by the Holy Spirit,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,until I put your enemies under your feet.”’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David himself calls him ‘Lord.’ Then how can he be his son?” And the large crowd kept listening to him with delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As he taught, he said,“Beware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes, to be greeted in the marketplaces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Theydevour widows’ housesand say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>As Jesus sat facing the offering box, he watched how the crowd was dropping their money into it. Many rich people were dropping in large amounts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then a destitute widow came and dropped in two small copper coins, worth about a cent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He called his disciples and said to them,“Truly I tell you, this destitute widow has dropped in more than all of those who are contributing to the offering box.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For all of them contributed out of their surplus, but she, in her poverty, has dropped in everything she had to live on.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
