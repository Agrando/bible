Not one stone here will be left on another that will not be torn down.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives facing the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew were asking him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>“Tell us, when will these things take place, and what will be the sign when these things will be put into effect?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus began to say to them,“See to it that no one deceives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Many will come in my name and say, ‘I am he,’ and they will deceive many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, stop being alarmed. These things must take place, but the end hasn't come yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines in various places. These things are only the beginning of the birth pains.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>“As for yourselves, be on your guard! Peoplewill hand you over to local councils, and you will be beaten in their synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings to testify to them because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But first, the gospel must be proclaimed to all nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“When they take you away and hand you over for trial, don't worry ahead of time about what you will say. Instead, say whatever is given to you in that hour, for it won't be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You will be hated continuously by everyone because of my name. But the person who endures to the end will be saved.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>“So when you see the destructive desecration standing where it should not be (let the reader take note),then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The person who is on his housetop must not come down and go into his house to take anything out of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the person who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>“How terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray that it may not be in winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For those days will be a time of suffering,a kind that has not happened from the beginning of the creation that God made until now and certainly will never happen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If the Lord did not limit those days, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect whom he has chosen, he has limited those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“At that time, if anyone says to you, ‘Look! Here is the Christ!’,or, ‘Look! There he is!’, don't believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For false christs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens to deceive, if possible, the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So be on your guard! I've told you everything before it happens.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“But after the suffering of those days,‘The sun will be darkened,the moon will not give its light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the stars will fall from the sky,and the powers of heaven will be shaken loose.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then people will see ‘the Son of Man coming in clouds’ with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He will send out his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>“Now learn a lessonfrom the fig tree. When its branches become tender and it produces leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the same way, when you see these things taking place, you will know that he is near, right at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Truly I tell you, this generation will not disappear until all these things take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>“No one knows when that day or hour will come—not the angels in heaven, not the Son, but only the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Be careful! Watch out! For you don't know when the time will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>“It's like a man who went on a trip. As he left home, he put his servants in charge, each with his own work, and he ordered the doorkeeper to be alert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So keep on watching, because you don't know when the master of the house is coming—whether in the evening, at three o'clock in the morning,or at dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Otherwise, he may come suddenly and find you asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I'm telling you what I'm telling everyone: Be alert!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
