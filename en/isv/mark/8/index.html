Some of them have come a long distance.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>His disciples answered him, “Where could anyone get enough bread to feed these people out here in the wilderness?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He asked them,“How many loaves of bread do you have?”They said, “Seven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and gave thanks. He broke them in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples to distribute. So they served them to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They also had a few small fish. He blessed them and said that the fish should also be distributed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The people ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up the leftover pieces—seven large baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now about 4,000 men were there. Then he sent them on their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisees arrived and began arguing with Jesus. They tested him by demanding from him a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He sighed deeply in his spirit and said,“Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I tell you, no sign will be given to this generation.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Leaving them, he got into a boat again and crossed to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread along and had only one loaf with them in the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus had been warning them,“Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they were discussing with one another the fact that they didn't have any bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Knowing this, Jesus said to them,“Why are you discussing the fact that you don't have any bread? Don't you understand or perceive yet? Are your hearts hardened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Doyou have eyes but fail to see? Do you have ears but fail to hear?Don't you remember?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>WhenI broke the five loaves for the 5,000, how many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces?”They told him, “Twelve.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>“When I brokethe seven loavesfor the 4,000, how many large baskets did you fill with the leftover pieces?”They told him, “Seven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he said to them,“Don't you perceive yet?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As they came to Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. He spit into his eyes, placed his hands on him, and asked him,“Do you see anything?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The man looked up and said, “I see people, but they look like trees walking around.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes again, and he saw clearly. His sight was restored, and he saw everything perfectly even from a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Jesus sent him home, saying,“Don't go into the village or tell anyone in the village.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Jesus and his disciples set out for the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he was asking his disciples,“Who do people say I am?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They answered him, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others one of the prophets.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he began to ask them,“But who do you say I am?”Peter answered him, “You are the Christ!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man would have to suffer a great deal and be rejected by the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he would be killed, but after three days he would rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He was speaking about this matter quite openly.Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But turning and looking at his disciples, Jesus rebuked Peter, saying,“Get behind me, Satan! For you are not thinking God's thoughts but human thoughts!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jesus called the crowd to himself along with his disciples and said to them,“If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what profit will a person have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Indeed, what can a person give in exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes with the holy angels in his Father's glory.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
