(For it was a very large stone.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were utterly astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he said to them, “Stop being astonished! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised. He is not here. Look at the place where they laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go and tell his disciples, especially Peter, that he is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they left the tomb and ran away, for shock and astonishment had overwhelmed them. They didn't say a thing to anyone, because they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told those who had been with him and who now were grieving and crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, they refused to believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this, he appeared in a different form to two disciples as they were walking into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They went back and told the others, who didn't believe them either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Finally he appeared to the eleven disciples while they were eating. He rebuked them for their unbelief and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who had seen him after he had risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said to them,“As you go into all the world, proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who doesn't believe will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>“These are the signs that will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they will pick up snakes in their hands;even if they drink any deadly poison it will not hurt them; and they will place their hands on the sick, and they will recover.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the Lord Jesus, after talking with them, was taken up to heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The disciples went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the signs that accompanied it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
