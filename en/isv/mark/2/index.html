Jesus was speaking the word to them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>when some people came and brought him a paralyzed man being carried by four men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Since they couldn't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof over the place where he was. They dug through it and let down the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,“Son, your sins are forgiven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now some scribes were sitting there, arguing among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>“Why does this man talk this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>At once, Jesus knew in his spirit what they were saying to themselves. He said to them,“Why are you arguing about such things among yourselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your cot, and walk’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I want you to knowthat the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”Then he said to the paralyzed man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“I say to you, get up, pick up your cot, and go home!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the man got up, immediately picked up his cot, and went out before all of them.As a result, all of the people were amazed and began to glorify God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd kept coming to him, and he kept teaching them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As he was walking along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's desk. Jesus said to him,“Follow me!” So Levi got up and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Later he was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and sinners were also eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who were following him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When the scribes and the Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus heard that, he said to them,“Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick ones do. I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now John's disciples and the Pharisees would fast regularly. Some people came and asked Jesus, “Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees’ disciples fast, but your disciples don't fast?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus said to them,“The wedding guests can't fast while the groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they can't fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and a worse tear is made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will make the skins burst, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is pouredinto fresh wineskins.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus happened to be going through the grainfields on the Sabbath. As they made their way, his disciples began picking the heads of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Pharisees said to him, “Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said to them,“Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How was it that he went into the House of God when Abiathar was high priest and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and gave some of it to his companions?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to them,“The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
