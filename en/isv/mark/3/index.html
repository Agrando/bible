Then he said to the man,“Hold out your hand.” The man held it out, and his hand was restored to health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Immediately the Pharisees, along with the Herodians, went out and began to plot against him to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea. A large crowd from Galilee, Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan, and from the region around Tyre and Sidon followed him. They came to him because they kept hearing about everything he was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus told his disciples to have a boat ready for him so that the crowd wouldn't crush him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he had healed so many people that all who had diseases kept crowding up against him in order to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they would fall down in front of him and scream, “You are the Son of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he sternly ordered them again and again not to tell people who he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus went up on a hillside and called to him those whom he wanted and they came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He appointed twelve whom he called apostles to accompany him, to be sent out to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have the authority to drive out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He appointed these twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>James, the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddeus; Simon the Cananaean;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he went home. The crowd came together again, so that Jesus and his disciples couldn't even eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When his family heard about it, they went to restrain him. For they kept saying, “He's out of his mind!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem kept repeating, “He has Beelzebul,” and “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables.“How can Satan drive out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ifa kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if a household is divided against itself, that household will not stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot stand. Indeed, his end has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man. Then he can ransack his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>TrulyI tell you, people will be forgiven their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never have forgiveness, but is guilty of eternal sin.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For they had been saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then his mother and his brothers arrived. They stood outside and sent word to him and called for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>A crowd was sitting around him. They said to him, “Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He answered them,“Who are my mother and my brothers?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then looking at the people sitting around him, he said,“Here are my mother and my brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
