I am sending my messenger ahead of you,who will prepare your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord!Make his paths straight!’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>John was baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>People from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were flocking to him, being baptized by him while they confessed their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now John was dressed in camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He kept proclaiming, “The one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal straps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I baptized you with water, but it is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At once the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was in the wilderness for forty days being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now after John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and proclaimed the gospel about the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said,“The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is near! Repent, and keep believing in the gospel!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to them,“Follow me, and I will make you fishermen of people!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So immediately they left their nets and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Going on a little farther he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat repairing their nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He immediately called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they went to Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The people were utterly amazed at his teaching, for he was teaching them like one with authority and not like their scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Suddenly there was a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit. He screamed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus rebuked him, saying,“Be quiet, and come out of him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>At this, the unclean spirit shook the man, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All the people were so stunned that they kept saying to each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He tells even the unclean spirits what to do, and they obey him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>After they left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed, sick with a fever, so they promptly told Jesus about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He went up to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began serving them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When evening came, after the sun had set, people started bringing to him all those who were sick or possessed by demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In fact, the whole city gathered at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. However, he wouldn't allow the demons to speak because they knew who he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In the morning, while it was still very dark, Jesus got up and went to a deserted place and prayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon and his companions searched diligently for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When they found him, they told him, “Everyone's looking for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said to them,“Let's go to the neighboring towns so that I can preach there, too. For that is why I came out here.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then a leper came to Jesus and began pleading with him. He fell on his knees and said to him, “If you want to, you can make me clean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said to him,“I do want to. Be made clean!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Instantly the leprosy left him, and he was clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Jesus sternly warned him and drove him away at once,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>telling him,“See to it that you don't say anything to anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when the man left, he began to proclaim it freely. He spread the word so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly, but had to stay out in deserted places. Still, people kept coming to him from everywhere.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
