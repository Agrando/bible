So the high priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus secretly and to have him put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For they kept saying, “This must not happen during the festival, lest there be a riot among the people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>While Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper and sitting at the table, a woman arrived with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume made from pure nard. She broke open the jar and poured the perfume on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Some who were there said to one another in irritation, “Why was the perfume wasted like this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>This perfume could have been sold for more than 300 denarii and the money given to the destitute.” So they got extremely angry with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said,“Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For you will always have the destitute with you and can help them whenever you want, but you will not always have me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has done what she could. She poured perfume on my body in preparation for my burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>TrulyI tell you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the high priests to betray Jesus to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they heard this, they were delighted and promised to give him money. So he began to look for a good opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus’ disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He sent two of his disciples and told them,“Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he goes into a house,say to its owner that the Teacher asks, ‘Where is my room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished and ready. Get everything ready for us there.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the disciples left and went into the city. They found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When evening came, Jesus arrived with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While they were at the table eating, Jesus said,“Truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me, one who is eating with me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They began to be very sad and said to him, one after the other, “Surely I am not the one, am I?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to them,“It's one of you twelve, the one who is dipping his bread into the bowl with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the Son of Man is going away, just as it has been written about him, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to them, saying,“Take some. This is my body.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said to them,“This is my blood of the covenant that is being poured out for many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly I tell you, I will never again drink the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Jesus said to them,“All of you will turn against me. For it is written,‘I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep will be scattered.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>However, after I have been raised, I will go to Galilee ahead of you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else turns against you, I certainly won't.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said to him,“Truly I tell you, today, this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Peter kept saying emphatically, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the others kept saying the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then they came to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples,“Sit down here while I pray.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to be distressed and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So he said to them,“I am deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Going on a little farther, he fell to the ground and kept praying that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He kept repeating,“Abba!Father! All things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I want but what you want.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When he went back, he found them asleep. He said to Peter,“Simon, are you asleep? You couldn't stay awake for one hour, could you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>All of youmust stay awake and pray that you won't come into temptation. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He went away again and prayed the same prayer as before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Again he came back and found them asleep, for their eyes were very heavy. They didn't even know what they should say to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He came back a third time and said to them,“You might as well keep on sleeping and resting.Enough of that! The time has come. Look! The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Get up! Let's go! See, the one who is betraying me is near!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. A crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him. They were from the high priests, the scribes, and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now the betrayer personally had given them a signal, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him, and lead him safely away.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So Judas immediately went up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi,”, and kissed him tenderly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then the men took hold of Jesus and arrested him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But one of those standing there drew his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said to them,“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, yet you didn't arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then all the disciples deserted him and ran away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>A certain young man was following Jesus. He was wearing nothing but a linen sheet. They grabbed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>but he left the linen sheet behind and ran away naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then they took Jesus to the high priest. All the high priests, elders, and scribes had gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Peter followed him at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard. He was sitting with the servants and warming himself at the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Meanwhile, the high priests and the whole Council were looking for some testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death, but they couldn't find any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Although many people gave false testimony against him, their testimony didn't agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then some men stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>“We ourselves heard him say,‘I will destroy this sanctuary made by humanhands, and in three days I will build another one not made by humanhands.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>But even on this point their testimony didn't agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Don't you have any answer to what these men are testifying against you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he kept silent and didn't answer at all. The high priest asked him again, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus said,“I am. And‘you will see the Son of Manseated at the right hand of the Power’and‘coming with the clouds of heaven.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>You have heard his blasphemy! What is your verdict?” All of them condemned him as deserving death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Some of them began to spit on him. They blindfolded him and kept hitting him with their fists and telling him, “Prophesy!” Even the servants took him and slapped him around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>While Peter was down in the courtyard, one of the high priest's servant girls came by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>When she saw Peter warming himself, she glared at him and said, “You, too, were with Jesus from Nazareth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied it, saying, “I don't know or understand what you're talking about.” Then he went out into the entryway. Just then a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>The servant girl saw him and again said to those who were standing around, “This man is one of them!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Again he denied it.After a little while the people who were standing there began to say to Peter again, “Obviously you're one of them, because you are a Galilean!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Then he began to invoke a divine curse and to swear with an oath, “I don't know this man you're talking about!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Just then a rooster crowed a second time.Peter remembered that Jesus said to him,“Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” Then he broke down and cried.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
