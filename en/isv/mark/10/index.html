Crowds gathered around him as usual, and he began to teach them again as was his custom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He answered them,“What did Moses command you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They said, “Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to divorce her.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus said to them,“It was because of your hardness of heart that he wrote this command for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But from the beginning of creation, ‘Godmade them male and female.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>‘That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the two will become one flesh.’So they are no longer two, but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, what God has joined together, man must never separate.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Back in the house, the disciples asked him about this again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So he said to them,“Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Andif a womandivorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Some people were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus saw this, he became furious and told them,“Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away. For the kingdom of God belongs to people like these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly I tell you, whoever doesn't receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never get into it at all.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he picked them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and tenderly blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As Jesus was setting out on a journey, a man ran up to him, knelt down in front of him, and asked him, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus said to him,“Why do you call me good? Nobody is good except for one—God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know the commandments: ‘Never murder.’‘Never commit adultery.’‘Never steal.’‘Never give false testimony.’‘Never cheat.’ ‘Honor your father and mother.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The man replied to him, “Teacher, I have kept all of these since I was a young man.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus looked at him and loved him. Then he told him,“You're missing one thing. Go and sell everything you own, give the moneyto the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the man was shocked at this statement and went away sad, because he had many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples,“How hard it will be for those who have wealth to get into the kingdom of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciples were startled by these words, but Jesus said to them again,“Children, how hard it is for those who trust in their wealthto get into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They were utterly amazed and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus looked at them intently and said,“For humans it is impossible, but not for God. All things are possible for God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter began to say to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said,“Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left his home, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or fields because of me and the gospel</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who will not receive a hundred times as much here in this world—homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, along with persecutions—as well as eternal life in the age to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus and his disciples were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. They were utterly amazed, and the others who followed were afraid. Once again, he took the twelve aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>“See, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death. Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>andthey will make fun of him, spit on him, whip him, and kill him. But after three days he will be raised.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, went to Jesus and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He asked them,“What do you want me to do for you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said to him, “Let us sit in your glory, one at your right and one at your left.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus told them,“You don't realize what you're asking. Can you drink from the cup that I'm going to drink from or be baptized with the baptism with which I'm going to be baptized?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They told him, “We can.”Jesus said to them,“You will drink from the cup that I'm going to drink and be baptized with the baptism with which I'm going to be baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But it's not up to me to grant you a seat at my right or my left. Those positions have already been prepared for others.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When the ten heard this, they began to be furious with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus called the disciples and said to them,“You know that those who are recognized as rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors act like tyrants over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>That's not the way it should be among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever wants to be first among you must be a slave to everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Foreven the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus, his disciples, and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus) was sitting by the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Many people sternly told him to be quiet, but he started shouting even louder, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So Jesus stopped and said,“Call him!”So they called the blind man and told him, “Have courage! Get up. He's calling you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He threw off his coat, jumped up, and went to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then Jesus asked him,“What do you want me to do for you?”The blind man said to him, “Rabbouni, I want to see again.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus told him,“Go. Your faith has made you well.” At once the man could see again, and he began to follow Jesus down the road.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
