They said, “Where did this man get all these things? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What great miracles are being done by his hands!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This is the builder, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, isn't it? His sisters are here with us, aren't they?” And they were offended by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus was telling them,“A prophet is without honor only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own home.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He couldn't perform a miracle there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He was utterly amazed at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages and continued teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He instructed them to take nothing along on the trip except a walking stick—no bread, no traveling bag, nothing in their moneybag.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They could wear sandals but not take along an extra shirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He told them repeatedly,“Whenever you go into a home, stay there until you leave that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If any place will not welcome you and thepeoplerefuse to listen to you, when you leave, shake its dust off your feet as a testimony against them.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they went and preached that people should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They also kept driving out many demons and pouring oil on many who were sick and healing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>King Herod heard about this, because Jesus’ name had become well-known. He was saying, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead! That's why these miracles are at work in him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others were saying, “He is Elijah.” Still others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the other prophets.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard about it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. For Herod had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>John had been telling Herod, “It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she couldn't do it</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because Herod was afraid of John. He knew that John was a righteous and holy man, and so he protected him. Whenever he listened to John, he did much of what he said. In fact, he liked listening to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>An opportunity came during Herod's birthday celebration, when he gave a banquet for his top officials, military officers, and the most important people of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. So the king told the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He swore with an oath to her, “I'll give you anything you ask for, up to half of my kingdom.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?”Her mother replied, “The head of John the Baptist.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Immediately the girl hurried back to the king with her request, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The king was deeply saddened, yet because of his oaths and his guests he was reluctant to refuse her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So without delay the king sent a soldier and ordered him to bring John's head. The soldier went and beheaded him in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he brought John's head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When John's disciples heard about this, they came and carried off his body and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He said to them,“Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest for a while.” For so many people were coming and going that they didn't even have time to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they went away in a boat to a deserted place by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But many people saw them leave and recognized them. So they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When it was quite late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and it's already late.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Send the crowds away so that they can go to the neighboring farms and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he answered them,“You give them something to eat.”They said to him, “Should we go and buy 200 denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He asked them,“How many loaves of bread do you have? Go and see.”They found out and told him, “Five loaves and two fish.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he ordered them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All of them ate and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftover bread and fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>There were 5,000 men who had eaten the loaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Jesus immediately had his disciples get into a boat and cross to Bethsaida ahead of him, while he sent the crowd away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>After saying goodbye to them, he went up on a hillside to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, while he was alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He saw that they were straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he came to them, walking on the sea. He intended to go up right beside them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>but when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and began to scream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>All of them saw him and were terrified. Immediately he said to them,“Have courage! It is I. Stop being afraid!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped blowing. The disciples were utterly astounded,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for they didn't understand the significance of the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When they had crossed over, they came ashore at Gennesaret and anchored the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>They ran all over the countryside and began carrying the sick on their cots to any place where they heard he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Wherever he went, whether into villages, towns, or farms, people would place their sick in the marketplaces and beg him to let them touch even the tassel of his garment, and all who touched it were healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
