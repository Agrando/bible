They bound Jesus with chains, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”Jesus answered him,“You say so.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The high priests kept accusing him of many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Pilate asked him again, “Don't you have any answer? Look how many accusations they're bringing against you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus no longer answered anything, so that Pilate was astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At every festival Pilate would release any one prisoner whom the people requested.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now there was a man in prison named Barabbas. He was with the insurgents who had committed murder during the rebellion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the crowd came and began to request that he do for them what he always did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Pilate answered them, “Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he knew that the high priests had handed him over because of jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the high priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release Barabbas for them instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Pilate said to them again, “Then what should I do with the man you call the king of the Jews?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They shouted back, “Crucify him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pilate asked them, “Why? What has he done wrong?”But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The soldiers led Jesus into the courtyard of the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters) and called out the whole guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted some thorns into a victor's crown, and placed it on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They began to greet him, “Long live the king of the Jews!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They kept hitting him on the head with a stick, spitting on him, kneeling in front of him, and worshiping him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forced a certain passer-by who was coming in from the country to carry Jesus’ cross. He was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They took Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means Skull Place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They tried to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he wouldn't take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they crucified him. They divided his clothes among themselves by throwing dice to see what each one would get.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The written notice of the charge against him read, “The king of the Jews.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They crucified two bandits with him, one on his right and the other on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>save yourself and come down from the cross!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes, were also making fun of him among themselves. They kept saying, “He saved others but can't save himself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now so that we may see it and believe.” Even the men who were crucified with him kept insulting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>At twelve noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>At three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,“Eloi, eloi, lema sabachthani?”, which means,“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “Listen! He's calling for Elijah!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So someone ran and soaked a sponge in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink, saying, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When the centurion who stood facing Jesus saw how he had cried out and breathed his last, he said, “This man certainly was the Son of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now there were women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of young James and Joseph, and Salome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They used to accompany him and care for him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him were there, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>It was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath. Since it was already evening,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Joseph of Arimathea, a highly respected member of the Council, who was waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Pilate wondered if Jesus had already died, so he summoned the centurion to ask him if he was in fact dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he let Joseph have the corpse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Joseph bought some linen cloth, took the body down, and wrapped it in the cloth. Then he laid it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
