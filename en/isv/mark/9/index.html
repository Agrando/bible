His appearance was changed in front of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and his clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Elijah appeared to them, accompanied by Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it's good that we're here! Let's set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>(Peter didn't know how to respond, for they were terrified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then a cloud appeared and overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I love. Keep on listening to him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Suddenly, as they looked around, they saw no one with them but Jesus alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On their way down the mountain, he ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They kept the matter to themselves but argued about what “rising from the dead” meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So they asked him, “Don't the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He told them,“Elijah is indeed coming first and will restore all things. Why, then, is it written that the Son of Man must suffer a great deal and be treated shamefully?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I tell you that Elijah has come, yet peopletreated him just as they pleased, as it is written about him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As they approached the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and some scribes arguing with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The whole crowd was very surprised to see Jesus and ran to welcome him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He asked the scribes,“What are you arguing about with them?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A man in the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that won't let him talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whenever it brings on a seizure, it throws him to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes stiff. So I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they didn't have the power.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus said to them,“You unbelieving generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. He fell on the ground and kept rolling around and foaming at the mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus asked his father,“How long has this been happening to him?” He said, “Since he was a child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The spirit has often thrown him into fire and into water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to him,“‘If you are able?’ Everything is possible for the person who believes!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>With tears flowing, the child's father at once cried out, “I do believe! Help my unbelief!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it,“You spirit that won't let him talk or hear—I command you to come out of him and never enter him again!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The spirit screamed, shook the child violently, and came out. The boy was like a corpse, and many said that he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus took his hand and helped him up, and he stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When Jesus came home, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn't we drive it out?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He told them,“This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they left that place and were passing through Galilee. Jesus didn't want anyone to know it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for he was teaching his disciples and saying to them,“The Son of Man will be betrayed into human hands. They will kill him, but after being dead for three days he will be raised.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They didn't understand what this statement meant, and were afraid to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was at home, he asked the disciples,“What were you arguing about on the road?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they kept silent, for on the road they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So he sat down and called the twelve. He told them,“If anyone wants to be first he must be last of all and servant of all.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he took a little child and had him stand among them. He took him in his arms and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>“Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>John said to Jesus, “Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We tried to stop him, because he wasn't a follower like us.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said,“Don't stop him! For no one who works a miracle in my name can slander me soon afterwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For whoever is not against us is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Truly I tell you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christwill never lose his reward.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>“If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life injured than to have two hands and go to hell,to the fire that cannot be put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste, how can you restore its flavor? Keep on having salt among yourselves, and live in peace with one another.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
