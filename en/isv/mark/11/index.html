As soon as you go into it, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever sat on.Untie it, and bring it along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you doing this?,’ say, ‘The Lord needs it,’ and he will send it back here at once.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So they went and found the colt outside in the street tied up next to a doorway. While they were untying it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>some men standing there asked them, “What are you doing untying that colt?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The disciples told them what Jesus had said, and the men let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their coats upon it, and he sat on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Many people spread their coats on the road, while others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those who went ahead and those who followed him were shouting,	“Hosanna!	How blessed is the one who comesin the name of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How blessed is the coming kingdomof our forefather David!	Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple and looked around at everything. Since it was already late, he went out with the twelve to Bethany.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus became hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Seeing in the distance a fig tree covered with leaves, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing except leaves because it wasn't the season for figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he said to it,“May no one ever eat fruit from you again!” Now his disciples were listening to this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they came to Jerusalem, he went into the temple and began to throw out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple. He overturned the moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of those who sold doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He wouldn't even let anyone carry a vessel through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he began to teach them, saying,“It is written, is it not, ‘My house is to be called a house of prayer for all nations’?But you have turned it into a hideoutfor bandits!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When the high priests and elders heard this, they began to look for a way to kill him. For they were afraid of him, because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When evening came, Jesus and his disciples would leave the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>While they were walking along early in the morning, they saw the fig tree dried up to its roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has dried up!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to them,“Have faith in God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Truly I tell you, if anyone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ if he doesn't doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thatis why I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have receivedit and it will be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“Whenever you stand up to pray, forgive whatever you have against anyone, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if you do not forgive, your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they went into Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking in the temple, the high priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and asked him, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority to do them?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to them,“I will ask you one question.Answer me, and then I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>WasJohn's authority to baptizefrom heaven or from humans? Answer me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They began discussing this among themselves. “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if we say, ‘From humans’…?” For they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone really thought John was a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they answered Jesus, “We don't know.”Then Jesus told them,“Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
