They also observe many other traditions, such as the washing of cups, jars, brass pots, and dinner tables.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, “Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with unclean hands.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He told them,“Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites. As it is written,‘These people honor me with their lips,but their hearts are far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their worship of me is empty,because they teach human rules as doctrines.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he said to them, “You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your own tradition!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘Whoever curses his father or mother must certainly be put to death.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you say, ‘If anyone tells his father or mother, “Whatever support you might have received from me is Corban,”’(that is, an offering to God)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You are destroying the word of God through your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many other things like that.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he called to the crowd again and said to them,“Listen to me, all of you, and understand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. It is what comes out of a person that makes a person unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When he had left the crowd and gone home, his disciples began asking him about the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to them,“Are you so ignorant? Don't you know that nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and is expelled as waste.” (Thus he declared all foods clean.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He continued,“It is what comes out of a person that makes a person unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it is from within, from the human heart, that evil thoughts come, as well as sexual immorality, stealing, murder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>adultery, greed, wickedness, cheating, shameless lust, envy, slander,arrogance, and foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these things come from within and make a person unclean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus left that place and went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, not wanting anyone to know he was there. However, it couldn't be kept a secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In fact, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell down at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the woman happened to be a Greek, born in Phoenicia in Syria. She kept asking him to drive the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he kept telling her,“First let the children be filled. It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the puppies.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the puppies under the table eat some of the children's crumbs.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he said to her,“Because you have said this, go! The demon has left your daughter.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So she went home and found the child lying in bed, and the demon was gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus left the territory of Tyre and passed through Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the territory of the Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Some people brought him a deaf man who also had a speech impediment. They begged him to lay his hand on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus took him away from the crowd to be alone with him. Putting his fingers into the man's ears, he touched his tongue with saliva.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then he looked up to heaven, sighed, and said to him,“Ephphatha,” that is,“Be opened!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>At once the man's ears were opened and his tongue was released, and he began to talk normally.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus ordered the people not to tell anyone, but the more he kept ordering them, the more they kept spreading the news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were amazed beyond measure, saying, “He does everything well! He even makes deaf people hear and mute people talk!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
