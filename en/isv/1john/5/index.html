Our faith is the victory that overcomes the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who overcomes the world? Is it not the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This man, Jesus Christ, is the one who came by water and blood—not with water only, but with water and with blood. The Spirit is the one who verifies this, because the Spirit is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three witnesses—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Spirit, the water, and the blood—and these three are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we accept human testimony, God's testimony is greater, because it is the testimony of God and because he has testified about his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The person who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in himself. The person who does not believe God has made him a liar by not believing the testimony that God has given about his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is found in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The person who has the Son has this life. The person who does not have the Son of God does not have this life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence that we have in him: if we ask for anything according to his will, he listens to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he listens to our requests, we can be sure that we have what we ask him for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray that God would give him life. This applies to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not telling you to pray about that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every kind of wrongdoing is sin, yet there are sins that do not lead to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that the person who has been born from God does not go on sinning. Rather, the Son of God protects them, and the evil one cannot harm them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are from God and that the whole world lies under the control of the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true God. We are in union with the one who is true, his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Little children, guard yourselves from idols.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
