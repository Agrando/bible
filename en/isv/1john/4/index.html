Instead, test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>This is how you can recognize God's Spirit: Every spirit who acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But every spirit who does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist. You have heard that he is coming, and now he is already in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Little children, you belong to God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These people belong to the world. That is why they speak from the world's perspective, and the world listens to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We belong to God. The person who knows God listens to us. Whoever does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Dear friends, let us continually love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This is how God's love was revealed among us: God sent his unique Son into the world so that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Dear friends, if this is the way God loved us, we must also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is how we know that we abide in him and he in us: he has given us his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We have seen for ourselves and can testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>God abides in the one who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, and he abides in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>We have come to know and believe in the love that God has for us. God is love, and the person who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This is how love has been perfected among us: we will have confidence on the day of judgment because, while we are in this world, we are just like him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love because he first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whoever says, “I love God,” but hates his brother is a liar. The one who does not love the brother whom he has seen cannot love a God whom he has not seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this is the commandment that we have from him: the person who loves God must also love his brother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
