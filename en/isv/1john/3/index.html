Yet that is what we are. For this reason the world does not recognize us, because it did not recognize him either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Dear friends, we are now God's children, but what we will be like has not been revealed yet. We know that when Christ is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And everyone who has this hope based on him keeps himself pure, just as he is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone who keeps living in sin also practices disobedience. In fact, sin is disobedience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You know that he was revealed to take away sins, and there is not any sin in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No one who remains in him goes on sinning. The one who goes on sinning hasn't seen him or known him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Little children, don't let anyone deceive you. The person who practices righteousness is righteous, just as he is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The person who practices sin belongs to the evil one, because the devil has been sinning since the beginning. The reason that the Son of God was revealed was to destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>No one who has been born from God practices sin, because God's seed abides in him. Indeed, he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is how God's children and the devil's children are distinguished. No person who fails to practice righteousness and to love his brother is from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the message that you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Do not be like Cain, who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's were righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love one another. The person who does not love remains in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is how we have come to know love: Christ gave his life for us. We, too, ought to give our lives for our brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Whoever has earthly possessions and notices a brother in need and yet withholds his compassion from him, how can the love of God remain in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, we must stop loving in word and in tongue, but instead love in action and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is how we will know that we belong to the truth and how we will be able to establish our hearts in his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence in the presence of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whatever we request we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his commandment: to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and to love one another as he commanded us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The person who keeps his commandments abides in God, and God abides in him. This is how we can be sure that he remains in us: he has given us his Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
