Every day people would lay him at what was called the Beautiful Gate so that he could beg from those who were going into the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When he saw that Peter and John were about to go into the temple, he asked them to give him something.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Peter, along with John, looked him straight in the eye and said, “Look at us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the man watched them closely, expecting to get something from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>However, Peter said, “I don't have any silver or gold, but I'll give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, walk!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Peter took hold of his right hand and began to help him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he sprung to his feet, stood up, and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple, walking, jumping, and praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When all the people saw him walking and praising God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>they knew that he was the man who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people came running together to them in what was called Solomon's Colonnade. They were dumbfounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Peter saw this, he said to the people: “Fellow Israelites, why are you wondering about this, and why are you staring at us as if by our own power or godliness we made him walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—the God of our ancestors—has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and rejected in the presence of Pilate, even though he had decided to let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and you killed the source of life, whom God raised from the dead. We are witnesses to that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It is his name, that is, by the faith of his name, that has healed this man whom you see and know. Yes, the faith that comes through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>“And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance like your leaders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This is how God fulfilled what he had predicted through the voice of all the prophets—that his Christ would suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, repent and turn to him to have your sins blotted out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord and so that he may send you Jesus, the Christ whom he appointed long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Heaven must receive him until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through the voice of his holy prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In fact, Moses said,‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to everything he tells you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Any person who will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“Indeed, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who followed him, also predicted these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You are the descendants of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant that God made with your ancestors when he said to Abraham, ‘Through your descendant all the families of the earth will be blessed.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning every one of you from your evil ways.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
