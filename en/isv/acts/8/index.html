That day a severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all of them, except for the apostles, were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Devout men buried Stephen as they mourned loudly for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul kept trying to destroy the church. Going into one house after another, he began dragging off men and women and throwing them in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now those who were scattered went from place to place preaching the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began to preach the Christ to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The crowds, hearing his message and seeing the signs that he was doing, paid close attention to what was said by Philip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Unclean spirits screamed with a loud voice as they came out of the many people they had possessed, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As a result, there was great rejoicing in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now in that city there was a man named Simon. He was practicing occult arts and thrilling the people of Samaria, claiming to be a great man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Everyone from the least to the greatest paid close attention to him, saying, “This man is the power of God, which is called great!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They paid careful attention to him because he had thrilled them for a long time with his occultic performances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Philip proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, men and women believed and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Even Simon believed, and after he was baptized he became devoted to Philip. He was amazed to see the signs and great miracles that were happening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They went down and prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Before this he had not come on any of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and said, “Give me this power too, so that when I lay my hands on someone he will receive the Holy Spirit.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, “May your money perish with you because you thought you could obtain God's free gift with money!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart isn't right before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, this thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see that you're turning into bitter poison and that you’re being chained by wickedness!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon answered, “Both of you pray to the Lord for me that none of the things you have said will happen to me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>After they had given their testimony and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, continuing to proclaim the good news in many Samaritan villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south by the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert road.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he got up and went. Now an Ethiopian eunuch was there. He was a member of the court of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and was in charge of all her treasures. He had come to Jerusalem to worship</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and was returning home. He was seated in his chariot, reading the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Spirit said to Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay close to it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah out loud.He asked, “Do you understand what you're reading?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He replied, “How can I unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to get in and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This was the passage of Scripture he was reading:	“Like a sheep he was led away to be slaughtered,and like a lamb is silent before its shearer,so he does not open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his humiliation, justice was denied him.Who can describe his generation?For his life is taken away from the earth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The eunuch said to Philip, “I ask you, about whom is the prophet speaking—about himself or about someone else?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip opened his mouth and, starting from this Scripture, told him the good news about Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As they were going along the road, they came to some water. The eunuch said, “Look, there's some water. What keeps me from being baptized?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So he ordered the chariot to stop, and Philip and the eunuch both went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch went on his way rejoicing and did not see Philip again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Philip found himself at Azotus. As he was passing through the region, he kept proclaiming the good news in all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
