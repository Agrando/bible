He said, “This very Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Some of them were persuaded to join Paul and Silas, especially a large crowd of devout Greeks and the wives of many prominent men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the Jews became jealous, and they took some contemptible characters who used to hang out in the public square, formed a mob, and started a riot in the city. They attacked Jason's home and searched it for Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials and shouted, “These fellows who have turned the world upside down have come here, too,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and Jason has welcomed them as his guests. All of them oppose the emperor's decrees by saying that there is another king—Jesus!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The crowd and the city officials were upset when they heard this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but after they had gotten a bond from Jason and the others they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That night the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These people were more receptive than those in Thessalonica. They were very willing to receive the message, and every day they carefully examined the Scriptures to see if those things were so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Many of them believed, including a large number of prominent Greek women and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when the Jews in Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul also in Berea, they went there to upset and incite the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The men who escorted Paul took him all the way to Athens and, after receiving instructions to have Silas and Timothy join him as soon as possible, they left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred to its depths to see the city full of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he began holding discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and other worshipers, as well as every day in the public square with anyone who happened to be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also debated with him. Some asked, “What is this blabbermouth trying to say?” while others said, “He seems to be preaching about foreign gods.” This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they took him, brought him before the Areopagus, and asked, “May we know what this new teaching of yours is?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It sounds rather strange to our ears, and we would like to know what it means.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there used to spend their time in nothing else than repeating or listening to the latest ideas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Paul stood up in front of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I was walking around and looking closely at the objects you worship, I even found an altar with this written on it: ‘To an unknown god.’ So I am telling you about the unknown object you worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He doesn't live in shrines made by human hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he isn't served by hands as if he needed anything. He himself gives everyone life, breath, and everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>From one man he made every nation of humanity to live all over the earth, fixing the seasons of the year and the boundaries they live in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>so that they might look for God, somehow reach for him, and find him. Of course, he is never far from any one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For we live, move, and exist because of him, as some of your own poets have said: ‘For we are his children, too.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So if we are God's children, we shouldn't think that the divine being is like gold, silver, or stone, or is an image carved by human imagination and skill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Though God has overlooked those times of ignorance, he now commands everyone everywhere to repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for he has set a day when he is going to judge the world with justice through a man he has appointed, and he has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When they heard about a resurrection of the dead, some began joking about it, while others said, “We will hear you again about this.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And so Paul left the meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Some men joined him and became believers. With them were Dionysius, who was a member of the Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and some others along with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
