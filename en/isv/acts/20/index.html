Then he said goodbye to them and left to go to Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He went through those regions and encouraged the people with many words. Then he went to Greece</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and stayed there for three months. When he was about to sail for Syria, a plot was made against him by the Jews, so he decided to go back through Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He was accompanied by Sopater (the son of Pyrrhus) from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These men went on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After the days of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi, and days later we joined them in Troas and stayed there for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the first day of the week, when we had met to break bread, Paul began to address the people. Since he intended to leave the next day, he went on speaking until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in a window, began to sink off into a deep sleep as Paul kept speaking longer and longer. Overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Paul went down, bent over him, took him into his arms, and said, “Stop being alarmed, for his life is in him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he went back upstairs, broke the bread, and ate. He talked with them for a long time, until dawn, and then left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they took the boy away alive and were greatly relieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We went ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were intending to pick up Paul. He had arranged it this way, since he had planned to travel there on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he met us in Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We sailed from there and on the following day arrived off Chios. The next day we crossed over to Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The day after that we came to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in Asia, as he was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, if that was possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From Miletus he sent messengers to Ephesus to ask the elders of the church to meet with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they came to him, he said to them, “You know how I lived among you the entire time from the first day I set foot in Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I served the Lord with all humility, with tears, and with trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I never shrank from telling you anything that would help you nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>“And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that in town after town the Holy Spirit assures me that imprisonment and suffering are waiting for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I don't place any value on my life, if only I can finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“Now I know that none of you among whom I traveled preaching the kingdom will ever see my face again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I therefore declare to you today that I am not responsible for the blood of any of you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for I never shrank from telling you the whole plan of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Pay attention to yourselves and to the entire flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to be shepherds of God's church, which he acquired with his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know that when I'm gone savage wolves will come among you and not spare the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Indeed, some of your own men will come forward and distort the truth in order to lure the disciples into following them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So be alert! Remember that for three years, night and day, I never stopped warning each of you with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>“I am now entrusting you to God and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I never desired anyone's silver, gold, or clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to support myself and those who were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In every way I showed you that by working hard like this we should help the weak and remember the words that the Lord Jesus himself said,‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When he had said this, he knelt down and prayed with all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All of them cried and cried as they put their arms around Paul and kissed him with affection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They were especially sorrowful because of what he had said—that they would never see his face again. Then they took him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
