Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The next day we arrived at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to visit his friends and receive any care he needed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>After putting out from there, we sailed on the sheltered side of Cyprus because the winds were against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>We sailed along the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia and reached Myra in Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We sailed slowly for a number of days and with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then, because the wind was against us, we sailed on the sheltered side of Crete off Cape Salome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Sailing past it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Much time had been lost, and because navigation had become dangerous and the day of fasting had already past, Paul began to warn them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>by saying, “Men, I see that in this voyage there will be hardship and a heavy loss not only of the cargo and ship but also of our lives.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship and not by what Paul said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Since the harbor was not a good place to spend the winter, most of the men favored putting out to sea from there on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix and spend the winter there. It is a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When a gentle breeze began to blow from the south, they thought they could achieve their purpose. So they raised the anchor and began to sail close to the shore of Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But it was not long before a violent wind (called a northeaster) swept down from the island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The ship was caught so that it couldn't face the wind, and we gave up and were swept along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As we drifted to the sheltered side of a small island called Cauda, we barely managed to secure the ship's lifeboat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They pulled it up on deck and used ropes to brace the ship. Fearing that they would hit the large sandbank near Lybia, they lowered the sail and drifted along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The next day, because we were being tossed so violently by the storm, they began to throw the cargo overboard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>On the third day they threw the ship's equipment overboard with their own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For a number of days neither the sun nor the stars were to be seen, and the storm continued to rage until at last all hope of our being saved vanished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete. You would have avoided this hardship and damage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now I urge you to have courage because there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For just last night an angel of God, to whom I belong and whom I serve, stood by me</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and said, ‘Stop being afraid, Paul! You must stand before the emperor. Indeed, God has given you all who are sailing with you.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So have courage, men, for I trust God that it will turn out just as he told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>However, we will have to run aground on some island.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It was the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through the Adriatic Sea when about midnight the sailors suspected that land was near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>On taking soundings, they found a depth of twenty fathoms. A little later they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and began praying for daylight to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now the sailors were trying to escape from the ship. They had lowered the lifeboat into the sea and pretended that they were going to lay out the anchors from the bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul told the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and set it adrift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Right up to daybreak Paul kept urging all of them to eat something, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been waiting and going without food, having eaten nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So I urge you to eat something, for it will help you survive, since none of you will lose a hair from his head.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>After he said this, he took some bread, thanked God in front of everyone, broke it, and began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>All of them were encouraged and had something to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>There were 276 of us on the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After they had eaten all they wanted, they began to lighten the ship by dumping the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When day came, they couldn't recognize the land, but they could see a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they cut the anchors free and left them in the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars, raised the foresail to the wind, and headed for the beach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship aground. The bow stuck and couldn't be moved, while the stern was broken to pieces by the force of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming ashore and escaping,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but the centurion wanted to save Paul and prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The rest were to follow, some on planks and others on various pieces of the ship. In this way all of them got to shore safely.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
