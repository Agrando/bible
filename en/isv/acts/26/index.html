I beg you, therefore, to listen patiently to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All the Jews know how I lived from the earliest days of my youth with my own people and in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They have known for a long time, if they would but testify to it, that I lived as a Pharisee by the standard of the strictest sect of our religion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>“And now it is for the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors that I stand here on trial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our twelve tribes, worshiping day and night with intense devotion, hope to attain it. It is for this hope, O King, that I am accused by the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why is it thought incredible by all of you that God should raise the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Indeed, I myself thought it my duty to take extreme measures against the name of Jesus from Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That is what I did in Jerusalem. I received authority from the high priests and locked many of the saints in prison. And when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I would even punish them frequently in every synagogue and try to make them blaspheme. Raging furiously against them, I would hunt them down even to distant cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“That is how I happened to be traveling to Damascus with authority based on a commission from the high priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On the road at noon, O King, I saw from heaven a light that was brighter than the sun flash around me and those who were traveling with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All of us fell to the ground, and I heard a voice asking me in the Hebrew language,‘Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me? It is hurting you to keep on kicking against the goads.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The Lord answered,‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But get up and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you to be a servant and witness of what you have seen and of what I will show you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will continue to rescue you from your people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You will open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from Satan's control to God, so that they might receive the forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>“And so, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Instead, I first told the people in Damascus and Jerusalem, then the whole countryside of Judea, and then the Gentiles to repent, turn to God, and practice works that are consistent with such repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For this reason the Jews grabbed me in the temple and kept trying to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I have had help from God to this day, and so I stand here to testify to high and low alike, stating only what the prophets and Moses said would happen—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the Christ would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead and would announce light to our people and the Gentiles.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As he continued to make his defense, Festus shouted, “You're out of your mind, Paul! Too much education is driving you crazy!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Paul said, “I'm not out of my mind, Your Excellency Festus. I'm uttering words of sober truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Indeed, the king knows about these things, and I can speak to him freely. For I am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice, since this wasn't done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Agrippa said to Paul, “Can you so quickly persuade me to become a Christian?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Paul replied, “Whether quickly or not, I wish to God that not only you but everyone listening to me today would become what I am—except for these chains!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and those who were sitting with him got up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As they were leaving, they began to say to each other, “This man isn't doing anything to deserve death or imprisonment.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Agrippa told Festus, “This man could have been set free if he hadn't appealed to the emperor.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
