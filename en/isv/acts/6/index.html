So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a Gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They had these men stand before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the word of God continued to spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem continued to grow rapidly. Even a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But some men who belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), as well as some Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and men from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and began to debate with Stephen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But they couldn't resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he kept speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So they secretly got some men to say, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes. Then they rushed at him, grabbed him, and brought him before the Council.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They had false witnesses stand up and say, “This man never stops saying things against this Holy Place and against the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then all who were seated in the Council glared at him and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
