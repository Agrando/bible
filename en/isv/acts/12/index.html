This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When he arrested him, he put him in prison and turned him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, planning to bring him out to the people after the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Peter was being kept in prison, but earnest prayer to God for him was being offered by the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That very night, before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter, bound with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, and guards in front of the door were watching the prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on his side, woke him up, and said, “Get up quickly!” His chains fell from his wrists.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the angel said to him, “Tuck in your shirt and put on your sandals!” He did this. Then the angel told him, “Put on your coat and follow me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he went out and began to follow him, not realizing that what was being done by the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They passed the first guard, then the second, and came to the iron gate that led into the city. It opened by itself for them, and they went outside and proceeded one block when the angel suddenly left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I'm sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hands of Herod and from everything the Jewish people were expecting!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where a large number of people had gathered and were praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he knocked at the outer gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>On recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she didn't open the gate but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They said to her, “You're out of your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was so. Then they said, “It's his angel.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Meanwhile, Peter kept on knocking and knocking. When they opened the gate, they saw him and were amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet, and then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He added, “Tell this to James and the brothers.” Then he left and went somewhere else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When morning came, there was no little commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Herod searched for him but didn't find him, so he questioned the guards and ordered them to be executed. Then he left Judea, went down to Caesarea, and stayed there for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Herod had a violent quarrel with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him as a group. After they had won over Blastus, who took care of the king's bedroom, they asked for peace because their country depended on the king's country for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, on a day that was set, Herod put on his royal robes, sat down on the royal seat, and made a speech to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The people kept shouting, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Immediately the angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the word of God continued to grow and spread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Barnabas and Saul had fulfilled their mission, they returned to Jerusalem, bringing with them John who was also called Mark.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
