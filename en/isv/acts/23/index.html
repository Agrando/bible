How can you sit there and judge me according to the law and yet in violation of the law order me to be struck?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The men standing near him asked, “Do you mean to insult God's high priest?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Paul answered, “I didn't realize, brothers, that he is the high priest. After all, it is written, ‘You must not speak evil about a ruler of your people.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Paul saw that some of them were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he shouted in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a descendant of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After he said that, an angry quarrel broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection and that there is no such thing as an angel or spirit, but the Pharisees believe in all those things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There was a great deal of shouting until some of the scribes who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and argued forcefully, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The quarrel was becoming violent, and the tribune was afraid that they would tear Paul to pieces. So he ordered the soldiers to go down, take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That night the Lord stood near him and said,“Have courage! For just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, you must testify in Rome, too.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In the morning, the Jews formed a conspiracy and took an oath not to eat or drink anything before they had killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>More than forty men formed this conspiracy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They went to the high priests and elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to taste any food before we have killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now then, you and the Council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you on the pretext that you want to look into his case more carefully, but before he arrives we'll be ready to kill him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the son of Paul's sister heard about the ambush, so he came and got into the barracks and told Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the tribune, because he has something to tell him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he took him, brought him to the tribune, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The tribune took him by the hand, stepped aside to be alone with him, and asked, “What have you got to tell me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He answered, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Council tomorrow as though they were going to examine his case more carefully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Don't believe them, because more than forty of them are planning to ambush him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink before they have killed him. They are ready now, just waiting for your consent.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The tribune dismissed the young man and ordered him not to tell anyone that he had notified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Get 200 soldiers ready to leave for Caesarea at nine o'clock tonight, along with seventy mounted soldiers and 200 soldiers with spears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Provide an animal for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Governor Felix.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He wrote a letter with this message:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“From Claudius Lysias to Your Excellency, Governor Felix. Greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man had been seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I went with the guard and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I wanted to know the exact charge they were making against him, so I had him brought before their Council.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I found that, although he was charged with questions about their law, there was no charge against him deserving death or imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Since a plot against the man has been reported to me, I am at once sending him to you and have also ordered his accusers to present their charges against him before you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the soldiers, in keeping with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The next day they let the horsemen ride on with him while they returned to their barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When these came to Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>After reading the letter, he asked which province he was from. On learning that he was from Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers arrive.” Then he ordered him to be kept in custody in Herod's palace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
