This same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you saw him go up into heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When they came into the city, they went to the upstairs room where they had been staying. They were Peter and John; James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas the son of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With one mind all of them kept devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At that time Peter got up among the brothers (there were about 120 people present) and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the voice of David about Judas, who was the guide to those who arrested Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he was one of our number and was chosen to share in this ministry.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now this man bought a field with the money he got for his crime. Falling on his face, he burst open in the middle, and all his intestines gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that this field is called in their language Hakeldama, that is, “The Field of Blood”.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>“For in the Book of Psalms it is written,	‘Let his estate be desolate, and let no one live on it,’and	‘Let someone else take over his office.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, one of the men who has associated with us all the time the Lord Jesus came and went among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning with the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, must become a witness with us to his resurrection.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they nominated two men—Joseph called Barsabbas, who also was called Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they prayed, “Lord, you know the hearts of all people. Show us which one of these two men you have chosen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to serve in this office of apostle, from which Judas fell away to go to his own place.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So they drew lots for them, and when the lot fell on Matthias, he was added to the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
