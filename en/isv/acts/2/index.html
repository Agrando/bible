Yet we hear them telling in our own tongues the great deeds of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All of them continued to be stunned and puzzled, and they kept asking one another, “What can this mean?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But others kept saying in derision, “They're full of sweet wine!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them, “Men of Judea and everyone living in Jerusalem! You must understand something, so pay close attention to my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>These men are not drunk as you suppose, for it's only nine o'clock in the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Rather, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>‘In the last days, God says,I will pour out my Spirit on everyone.	Your sons and your daughters will prophesy,your young men will see visions,and your old men will dream dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In those days I will even pour out my Spiriton my slaves, men and women alike,and they will prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will work wonders in the sky aboveand signs on the earth below:blood, fire, and clouds of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun will turn to darkness,and the moon to blood,before the coming of the great and glorious Day of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then whoever calls on the name of the Lordwill be saved.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>“Fellow Israelites, listen to these words! Jesus from Nazareth was a man accredited to you by God through miracles, wonders, and signs that God performed through him among you, as you yourselves know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This very man, after he was arrested according to the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But God raised him up and destroyed the pains of death, since it was impossible for him to be held in its power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says about him,	‘I always see the Lord in front of me,for he is at my right handso that I cannot be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That is why my heart is gladand my tongue rejoices,yes, even my body still rests securely in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For you will not abandon my soul to Hadesor allow your Holy One to experience decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have made the ways of life known to me,and you will fill me with gladness in your presence.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>“Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and that his tomb is among us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him with an oath to put one of his descendants on his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he looked ahead and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ:	‘He was not abandoned to Hades,and his flesh did not experience decay.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It was this very Jesus whom God raised, and of that we are all witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He has been exalted to the right hand of God, has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, and has poured out what you are seeing and hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not go up to heaven, but he said,	‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>until I make your enemies your footstool.”’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore, let the entire house of Israel understand beyond a doubt that God made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart. They asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Peter answered them, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the Holy Spirit as a gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For this promise belongs to you and your children, as well as to all those who are far away, whom the Lord our God may call to himself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>With many more words he continued to testify and to plead with them, saying, “Be saved from this corrupt generation!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about 3,000 persons were added to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They continually devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to times of prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>A sense of fear came over everyone, and many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>All the believers were together, and they shared everything with one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They made it their practice to sell their possessions and goods and to distribute the proceeds to anyone who was in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They had a single purpose and went to the temple every day. They ate at each other's homes and shared their food with glad and humble hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>They kept praising God and enjoying the good will of all the people. And every day the Lord was adding to them people who were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
