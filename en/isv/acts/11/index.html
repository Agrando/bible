He said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>“I was in the town of Joppa praying when in a trance I saw a vision: Something like a large linen sheet was coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners, and it came right down to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When I examined it closely, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I also heard a voice telling me,‘Get up, Peter! Kill something and eat it.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But I replied, ‘Absolutely not, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the voice from heaven answered a second time,‘You must stop calling common what God has made clean!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This happened three times. Then everything was pulled up to heaven again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“At that very moment three men arrived at the house where we were staying. They had been sent to me from Caesarea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Spirit told me to go with them and not to treat them differently. These six brothers went with me, too, and we went into the man's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his home and saying, ‘Send messengers to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will speak words to you by which you and your entire home will be saved.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he had on us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then I remembered the word of the Lord—how he had said,‘John baptized withwater, but you will be baptized withthe Holy Spirit.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now if God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to try to stop God?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they heard this, they quieted down, and praised God, saying, “So God has given even the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the people who were scattered by the persecution that started because of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But among them were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene who came to Antioch and began talking to the Hellenistic Jews too, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and so they sent Barnabas all the way to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he arrived, he rejoiced to see what the grace of God had done, and with a hearty determination he continuously encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith. And so a large crowd was brought to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When he found him, he brought him to Antioch, and for a whole year they were guests of the church and taught a large crowd. It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>At that time some prophets from Jerusalem came down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>One of them named Agabus got up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine all over the world. This happened during the reign of Claudius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So every one of the disciples decided, as he was able, to send a contribution to the brothers living in Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They did this by sending Barnabas and Saul to the elders.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
