They also had John to help them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They went through the whole island as far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish occult practitioner and false prophet named Bar-Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He was associated with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. He sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas the occult practitioner (that is the meaning of his name) continued to oppose them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked him straight in the eye</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said, “You are full of every form of deception and trickery, you son of the devil, you enemy of all that is right! You will never stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord, will you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The hand of the Lord is against you now, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a while!” At that moment a dark mist came over him, and he went around looking for someone to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the Lord's teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Paul and his men set sail from Paphos and arrived in Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and went back to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They left Perga and arrived in Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders asked them, “Brothers, if you have any message of encouragement for the people, you may speak.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said: “Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made them a great people during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he led them out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>After he had put up with them for forty years in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>he destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan. Then he gave them their land as an inheritance</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for about 450 years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“Then they demanded a king, and for forty years God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he removed Saul and made David their king, about whom he testified, ‘I have found that David, the son of Jesse, is a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It was from this man's descendants that God, as he promised, brought to Israel a Savior, who is Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Before his coming, John had already preached a baptism of repentance to all the people in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When John was finishing his work, he said, ‘Who do you think I am? I am not the one. No, but he is coming after me, and I am not worthy to untie the sandals on his feet.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“My brothers, descendants of Abraham's family, and those among you who fear God, it is to us that the message of this salvation has been sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the people who live in Jerusalem and their leaders, not knowing who he was, condemned him and fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Although they found no reason to sentence him to death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they had finished doing everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised him from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and for many days he appeared to those who had come with him to Jerusalem from Galilee. These are now his witnesses to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We are telling you the good news: What God promised our ancestors</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>he has fulfilled for us, their descendants, by raising Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm, ‘You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He raised him from the dead, never to experience decay. As he said, ‘I will give you the holy promises made to David.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In another Psalm he says, ‘You will not let your Holy One experience decay.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David, after he had served God's purpose in his own generation, died and was laid to rest with his ancestors, and so he experienced decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>However, the man whom God raised did not experience decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>“Therefore, brothers, you must understand that through him the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and that everyone who believes in him is justified and freed from everything that kept you from being justified by the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So be careful that what the prophets said does not happen to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>‘Look, you mockers!Be amazed and die!	For I am doing a work in your days, a work that you would not believeeven if someone told you!’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>As Paul and Barnabas were leaving, the people kept urging them to tell them the same things the next Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who kept talking to them and urging them to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The next Sabbath almost the whole town gathered to hear the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to object to the statements made by Paul and even to abuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Paul and Barnabas boldly declared, “We had to speak God's word to you first, but since you reject it and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we are now going to turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For that is what the Lord ordered us to do: ‘I have made you a light to the Gentiles to be the means of salvation to the very ends of the earth.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord. Meanwhile, all who had been destined to eternal life believed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and the word of the Lord began to spread throughout the whole region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews stirred up devout women of high social standing and the officials in the city, started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Meanwhile, the disciples continued to be full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
