For it's obvious to everybody living in Jerusalem that an unmistakable sign has been done by them, and we can't deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But to keep it from spreading any further among the people, let us warn them never again to speak to anyone in this name.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered them, “You must decide whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for we cannot stop talking about what we have seen and heard.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they threatened them even more and then let them go. They couldn't find any way to punish them, because all the people continued to praise God for what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After they were released, they went to their own people and told them everything the high priests and the elders had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When they heard this, they all raised their voices to God and said, “Master, you made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You said by the Holy Spirit through the voice of our ancestor, your servant David,	‘Why do the Gentiles rage,and the people devise useless plots?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth take their stand,and rulers meet together against the Lordand against his Christ.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>“For in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate actually met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do all that your hand and your will had predetermined to take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Lord, pay attention to their threats now, and allow your servants to speak your word with all boldness</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>as you stretch out your hand to heal and to perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When they had prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the whole group of believers was one in heart and soul, and nobody called any of his possessions his own. Instead, they shared everything they owned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was on them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For none of them needed anything, because all who had land or houses would sell them and bring the money received for the things sold</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and lay it at the apostles’ feet. Then it was distributed to anyone who needed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now Joseph, a Levite and a native of Cyprus, who was named Barnabas by the apostles (the name means “a son of encouragement”),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
