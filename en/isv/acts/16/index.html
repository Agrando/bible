Here there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, although his father was a Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He was highly regarded by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Paul wanted this man to go with him, so he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who lived in those places, for everyone knew that his father was a Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As they went from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for them to obey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the churches continued to be strengthened in the faith and to increase in numbers every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia because they had been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They went as far as Mysia and tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>During the night Paul had a vision. A man from Macedonia was standing there and pleading with him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As soon as he had seen the vision, we immediately looked for a way to go to Macedonia, for we were convinced that God had called us to tell them the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Sailing from Troas, we went straight to Samothrace, the next day to Neapolis,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and from there to Philippi, a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We were in this city for several days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On the Sabbath day we went out of the gate and along the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer. We sat down and began talking to the women who had gathered there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple goods from the city of Thyatira, was listening to us. She was a worshiper of God, and the Lord opened her heart to listen carefully to what was being said by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When she and her family were baptized, she urged us, “If you are convinced that I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my home.” And she continued to insist that we do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Once, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of fortune-telling and who had brought her owners a great deal of money by predicting the future.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She would follow Paul and us and shout, “These men are servants of the Most High God and are proclaiming to you a way of salvation!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She kept doing this for many days until Paul became annoyed, turned to the spirit, and said, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out that very moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the public square.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are stirring up a lot of trouble in our city. They are Jews</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and are advocating customs that we are not allowed to accept or practice as Romans.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The crowd joined in the attack against them. Then the magistrates had them stripped of their clothes and ordered them beaten with sticks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After giving them a severe beating, they threw them in jail and ordered the jailer to keep them under tight security.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Having received these orders, he put them into the inner cell and fastened their feet in leg irons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Around midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Suddenly, there was an earthquake so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken. All the doors immediately flew open, and everyone's chains were unfastened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, for he thought the prisoners had escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul shouted in a loud voice, “Don't hurt yourself, for we are all here!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The jailer asked for torches and rushed inside. He was trembling as he knelt in front of Paul and Silas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he took them outside and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They answered, “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will be saved.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and everyone in his home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>At that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds. Then he and his entire family were baptized immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He brought them upstairs into his house and set food before them, and he and everyone in his house were thrilled to be believers in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When day came, the magistrates sent guards and said, “Release those men.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent word to release you. So come out now and go in peace.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul told them, “They have had us beaten publicly without a trial and have thrown us into jail, even though we are Roman citizens. Now are they going to throw us out secretly? Certainly not! Have them come and escort us out.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The guards reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So they came, apologized to them, and escorted them out. Then they asked them to leave the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Leaving the jail, they went to Lydia's house. They saw the brothers, encouraged them, and then left.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
