And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? So how could you have conceived such a thing in your heart? You did not lie to men but to God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear seized everyone who heard about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The young men got up, wrapped him up, carried him outside, and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Peter asked her, “Tell me, did you sell the land for that price?”She answered, “Yes, that was the price.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Peter said to her, “How could you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you outside as well.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She instantly fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in, they found her dead. So they carried her out and buried her next to her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear seized the whole church and everyone else who heard about this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now many signs and wonders were continuously being performed by the apostles among the people. And they were all together in Solomon's Colonnade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>None of the other people dared to join them, although the people continued to hold them in high regard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless, still more believers, a vast number of both men and women, were being added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As a result, people kept carrying their sick into the streets and placing them on stretchers and cots so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he went by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Even from the towns around Jerusalem crowds continued coming in to bring their sick and those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the high priest and all those from the sect of the Sadducees who were with him were filled with jealousy. So they went out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>arrested the apostles, and put them in the city jail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But at night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and led them out. He told them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>“Go and stand in the temple and keep on telling the people the whole message about this life.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After they heard this, they went into the temple at daybreak and began to teach. The high priest and those who were with him arrived, called the Council and all the elders of Israel together, and sent word to the prison to have the men brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the temple police got there, they did not find them in the prison. They came back and reported,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>“We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the commander of the temple guards and the high priests heard these words, they were utterly at a loss as to what could have happened to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then someone came and told them, “Look! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the commander of the temple guards went with his men to bring them back without force, because they were afraid of being stoned to death by the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When they brought them back, they made them stand before the Council, and the high priest began to question them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said, “We gave you strict orders not to teach in his name, didn't we? Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to bring this man's blood on us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our ancestors raised Jesus to life after you hung him on a tree and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>God has exalted to his right hand this very man as our Leader and Savior in order to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who keep on obeying him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they heard this, they became furious and wanted to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and ordered the men to be taken outside for a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he said to them, “Fellow Israelites, consider carefully what you propose to do to these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For in days gone by Theudas appeared, claiming that he was important, and about 400 men joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and disappeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After that man, at the time of the census, Judas the Galilean appeared and got people to follow him. He, too, died, and all his followers were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>“I'm telling you to keep away from these men for now. Leave them alone, because if this plan or movement is of human origin, it will fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>However, if it is from God, you won't be able to stop them, and you may even discover that you are fighting against God!” So they were convinced by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>After calling in the apostles and beating them, they ordered them to stop speaking in the name of Jesus and let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They left the Council, rejoicing to have been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the Name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Every day in the temple and from house to house they kept teaching and proclaiming that Jesus is the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
