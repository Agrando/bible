He found a few disciples there</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”They answered him, “No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He then asked, “Then into what were you baptized?”They answered, “Into John's baptism.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There were about twelve men in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He went into the synagogue and spoke there boldly for three months, holding discussions and persuading them about the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some people became stubborn, refused to believe, and slandered the Way before the people, he left them, took his disciples away from them, and had daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God continued to do extraordinary miracles by Paul's hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his skin were taken to the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then some Jews who went around trying to drive out demons attempted to use the name of the Lord Jesus on those who had evil spirits, saying, “I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the evil spirit said to them, “I know Jesus, and I am acquainted with Paul, but who are you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them, got the better of them, and so violently overpowered all of them that they fled out of the house naked and bruised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When this became known to everyone living in Ephesus, Jews and Greeks alike, fear came on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in high honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Many who became believers kept coming and confessing and telling about their practices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover, many people who had practiced occult arts gathered their books and burned them in front of everybody. They estimated the price of them and found they were worth 50,000 silver coins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that way the word of the Lord kept spreading and triumphing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After these things had happened, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to go on to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have gone there, I must also see Rome.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself stayed in Asia a while longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now just about that time a great commotion broke out concerning the Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A silversmith named Demetrius provided a large income for the skilled workers by making silver shrines of Artemis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He called a meeting of these men and others who were engaged in similar trades and said, “Men, you well know that we get a good income from this business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You also see and hear that, not only in Ephesus, but almost all over Asia, this man Paul has won over and taken away a large crowd by telling them that gods made by human hands are not gods at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>There is a danger not only that our business will lose its reputation but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be brought into contempt and that she will be robbed of her majesty that brought all Asia and the world to worship her.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When they heard this, they became furious and began to shout, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed into the theater together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's fellow travelers from Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Paul wanted to go into the crowd, but the disciples wouldn't let him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Even some officials of the province of Asia who were his friends sent him a message urging him not to risk his life in the theater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused, and most of them didn't know why they were meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Some of the crowd concluded it was because of Alexander, since the Jews had pushed him to the front. So Alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when they found out that he was a Jew, they all started to shout in unison for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When the city recorder had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who in the world doesn't know that this city of Ephesus is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of the statue that fell down from heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Since these things cannot be denied, you must be quiet and not do anything reckless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For you have brought these men here, although they neither rob temples nor blaspheme our goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So if Demetrius and his workers have a charge against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They should accuse one another there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if you want anything else, it must be settled in the regular assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, and there is no good reason we can give to justify this commotion.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
