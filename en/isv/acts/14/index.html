Some were with the Jews, while others were with the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now when an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, along with their authorities, to mistreat and stone them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian towns of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding territory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There they kept telling the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now in Lystra there was a man sitting down who couldn't use his feet. He had been crippled from birth and had never walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He was listening to Paul as he spoke. Paul watched him closely, and when he saw that he had faith to be healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he said in a loud voice, “Stand up straight on your feet!” Then the man jumped up and began to walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have become like men and have come down to us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They began to call Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, because he was the main speaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The priest of the temple of Zeus, which was just outside the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates. He and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“Men, why are you doing this? We are merely human beings with natures like your own. We are telling you the good news to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>yet he has not left himself without a witness by doing good, by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, and by filling you with food and joyful hearts.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even by saying this it was all they could do to keep the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowds by persuasion. They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, thinking he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the disciples formed a circle around him, and he got up and went back to town. The next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As they were proclaiming the good news in that city, they discipled a large number of people. Then they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith, saying, “We must endure many hardships to get into the kingdom of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They appointed elders for them in each church, and with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They spoke the word in Perga and went down to Attalia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When they arrived, they called the church together and told them everything that God had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they spent a long time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
