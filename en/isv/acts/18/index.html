Paul went to visit them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and because they had the same trade he stayed with them. They worked together because they were tentmakers by trade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Every Sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and try to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to the word as he solemnly assured the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when they began to oppose him and insult him, he shook out his clothes in protest and told them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he left that place and went to the home of a man named Titius Justus, who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, along with his whole family. Many Corinthians who heard Paul also believed and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision,“Stop being afraid to speak out! Do not be silent!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you or harm you, because I have many people in this city.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So he lived there for a year and a half and continued to teach the word of God among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews united in an attack on Paul and brought him before the judge's seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They said, “This man is persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to the law.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Paul was about to open his mouth when Gallio said to the Jews, “If there were some misdemeanor or crime involved, it would be reasonable to put up with you Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But since it is a question about words, names, and your own law, you will have to take care of that yourselves. I refuse to be a judge in these matters.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So he drove them away from the judge's seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then all of them took Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and began beating him in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>After staying there for quite a while longer, Paul said goodbye to the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchraea he had his hair cut, since he was under a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When they arrived in Ephesus, he left them there. Then he went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They asked him to stay longer, but he refused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As he told them goodbye, he said, “I will come back to you again if it is God's will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he arrived in Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem, greeted the church, and then returned to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos arrived in Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria and an eloquent man, one powerful in the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He had been instructed in the Lord's way, and with spiritual fervor he kept speaking and teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew only about John's baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained God's way to him more accurately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers wrote and urged the disciples to welcome him. On his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He successfully refuted the Jews in public and proved by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
