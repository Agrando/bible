He is a ringleader in the sect of the Nazarenes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and even tried to profane the temple, but we arrested him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By examining him for yourself, you will be able to find out from him everything of which we accuse him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Jews supported his accusations by asserting that these things were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he replied: “Since I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I am pleased to present my defense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You can verify for yourself that I went up to worship in Jerusalem no more than twelve days ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They never found me debating with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or throughout the city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they cannot prove to you the charges they are now bringing against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, I admit to you that in accordance with the Way, which they call a heresy, I worship the God of our ancestors and believe in everything written in the Law and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have the same hope in God that they themselves cherish—that there is to be a resurrection of the righteous and the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, I always do my best to have a clear conscience in the sight of God and people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After many years I have come back to my people to bring gifts for the poor and to offer sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They found me in the temple doing these things just as I had completed the purification ceremony. No crowd or noisy mob was present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But some Jews from Asia were there, and they should be here before you to accuse me if they have anything against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Otherwise, these men themselves should tell what wrong they found when I stood before the Council—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>unless it is for the one thing I shouted as I stood among them: ‘It is for the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Felix was rather well informed about the Way, and so he adjourned the trial with the comment, “When Tribune Lysias arrives, I will decide your case.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He ordered the centurion to guard Paul but to let him have some freedom and not to keep any of his friends from caring for his needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Some days later, Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him talk about faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and said, “For the present you may go. When I get a chance, I will send for you again.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At the same time he was hoping to get money from Paul, and so he would send for him frequently to talk with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Since Felix wanted to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in prison.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
