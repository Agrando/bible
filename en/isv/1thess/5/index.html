We do not belong to the night or to darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, let us not fall asleep like others do, but let us stay awake and be sober.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For people who go to sleep, go to sleep at night; and people who get drunk, get drunk at night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But since we belong to the day, let us be sober. We must put on the breastplate of faith and love, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For God has not destined us for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who died for us in order that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So then, encourage one another and build each other up, as you are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Brothers, we ask you to show your appreciation for those who work among you, set an example for you in the Lord, and instruct you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We urge you, brothers, to instruct those who are idle, cheer up those who are discouraged, and help those who are weak. Be patient with everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Make sure that no one pays back evil for evil. Instead, always pursue what is good for each other and for everyone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Always be joyful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Continually be prayerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In everything be thankful, because this is God's will in Christ Jesus for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not put out the Spirit's fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not despise prophecies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Instead, test everything. Hold on to what is good,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but keep away from every kind of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>May the God of peace himself make you holy in every way. And may your whole being—spirit, soul, and body—be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Brothers, pray for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I order you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
