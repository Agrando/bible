Indeed, you yourselves know that we were destined for this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In fact, when we were with you, we told you ahead of time that we were going to suffer persecution. And as you know, that is what happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But when I could stand it no longer, I sent Timothy to find out about your faith. I was afraid that the tempter had tempted you in some way, and that our work had been a waste of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Timothy has just now come back to us from you and has told us the good news about your faith and love. He also told us that you always have fond memories of us and want to see us, just as we want to see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That's why, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you by your faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For now we can go on living, as long as you continue to stand firm in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we have in God's presence because of you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We pray very hard night and day that we may see you again face to face, so that we may supply whatever is lacking in your faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now may our God and Father and our Lord Jesus guide us to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>May the Lord greatly increase your love for each other and for all people, just as we love you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then your hearts will be strong in holiness and blameless in the presence of our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his saints.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
