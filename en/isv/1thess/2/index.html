Yet we were encouraged by our God to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For our appeal does not spring from deceit, impure motives, or trickery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Rather, because we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, we speak as we do, not trying to please people but God, who tests our motives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As you know, we did not come with words of flattery or with a scheme to make money. God is our witness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We did not seek praise from people—from you or from anyone else—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>even though as apostles of Christ we might have made such demands. Instead, we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother tenderly caring for her own children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We cared so deeply for you that we were determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but our very lives. That is how dear you were to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You remember, brothers, our labor and toil. We worked night and day so that we would not become a burden to any of you while we proclaimed the gospel of God to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You and God are witnesses of how pure, honest, and blameless our conduct was among you who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You know very well that we treated each of you the way a father treats his children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We comforted and encouraged you, urging you to live in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into his kingdom and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Here is another reason why we constantly give thanks to God: When you received God's word, which you heard from us, you did not accept it as the word of humans but for what it really is—the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea that are in union with Christ Jesus. You suffered the same persecutions from the people of your own country as they did from those Jews</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets and have persecuted us. They are displeasing to God and are the enemies of all people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because they try to keep us from telling the Gentiles how they can be saved. The result is that they are always adding to the measure of their sins. However, wrath has come on them at last!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Brothers, although we have been separated from you for a little while—in person but not in heart—we desire with great eagerness to see you again face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That is why we wanted to come to you. Certainly I, Paul, time and again wanted to come, but Satan blocked our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After all, who is our hope, joy, or reason for boasting in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming? It is you, isn't it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yes, you are our glory and joy!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
