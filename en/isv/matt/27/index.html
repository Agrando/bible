He brought the thirty pieces of silver back to the high priests and elders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.”But they said, “What do we care? See to that yourself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then he flung the pieces of silver into the sanctuary and went outside. Then he went away and hanged himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The high priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, because it is blood money.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they decided to use the money to buy the Potter's Field as a burial ground for foreigners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is why that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then what had been declared through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,	“They took the thirty pieces of silver,the value of the man on whom a price had been set by the Israelites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and they gave them for the potter's field,as the Lord commanded me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Meanwhile, Jesus was made to stand in front of the governor. The governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”Jesus said,“You say so.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While Jesus was being accused by the high priests and elders, he made no reply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate said to him, “Don't you hear how many charges they're bringing against you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus did not reply at all, so that the governor was very surprised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At every festival the governor had a custom of releasing to the crowd any prisoner whom they wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So when the people had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which man do you want me to release for you—Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Christ?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he knew that they had handed him over because of jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message. It said, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for today I have suffered terribly because of a dream about him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the high priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to demand that Jesus be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the governor said to them, “Which of the two men do you want me to release for you?”They said, “Barabbas!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus, who is called the Christ?”They all said, “Let him be crucified!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He asked, “What has he done wrong?”But they kept shouting louder and louder, “Let him be crucified!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was about to break out instead. So he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man's blood. You must see to that yourselves.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>All the people answered, “Let his blood be on us and our children!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the imperial headquarters and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Twisting some thorns into a victor's crown, they placed it on his head and put a stick in his right hand. They knelt down in front of him and began making fun of him, saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they spit on him and took the stick and hit him repeatedly on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As they were leaving, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry Jesus’ cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means “Skull Place”),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they offered him a drink of wine mixed with gall. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>After they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by throwing dice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then they sat down there and continued guarding him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Above his head they placed the charge against him. It read, “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>At that time two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and saying, “You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days—save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes and elders, were also making fun of him. They kept saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>“He saved others but can't save himself! He is the king of Israel. Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he cares for him. After all, he said,‘I am the Son of God,’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Even the bandits who were crucified with him kept insulting him in the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>About three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”, which means,“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “He's calling for Elijah.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So one of the men at once ran off, took a sponge, and soaked it in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But the others kept saying, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah will come and save him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice again and gave up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Suddenly the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were split open,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>the tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had died were raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>After his resurrection, they came out of their tombs and went into the Holy City and appeared to many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When the centurion and those guarding Jesus with him saw the earthquake and the other things that were taking place, they were terrified and said, “This man certainly was the Son of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now many women were also there, watching from a distance. They had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had ministered to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>When evening came, a rich man arrived from Arimathea. His name was Joseph, and he had become a disciple of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be handed over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Then he placed it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. After rolling a large stone across the door of the tomb, he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained there, sitting in front of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>The next day (which is after the Day of Preparation), the high priests and Pharisees gathered before Pilate</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said while he was still alive,‘After three days I will be raised.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Therefore, order the tomb to be secured until the third day, or his disciples may go and steal him and then tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead.’ Then the last deception would be worse than the first one.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate told them, “You have a military guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone in the presence of the guards.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
