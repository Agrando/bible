He has been raised from the dead, and that's why these miracles are at work in him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Herod had arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Although Herod wanted to kill him, he was afraid of the crowd, since they regarded John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Herod's birthday celebration was held, the daughter of Herodias danced before the guests. She pleased Herod</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me, right here on a platter, the head of John the Baptist.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Though the king was saddened at this, because of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So he sent word and had John beheaded in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When John's disciples came, they carried off the body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus heard this, he left that place and went by boat to a deserted place by himself. The crowds heard of it and followed him on foot from the towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion for them and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when evening came, the disciples went to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and it's already late. Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus said to them,“They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They told him, “We don't have anything here except five loaves of bread and two fish.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said,“Bring them here to me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All of them ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up what was left of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now those who had eaten were about 5,000 men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus immediately had the disciples get into a boat and cross to the other side ahead of him, while he sent the crowds away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After dismissing the crowds, he went up on a hillside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By this time the boat was in the middle of the sea and was being battered by the waves, for the wind was against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Shortly before dawn he came to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified and said, “It's a ghost!” And they screamed in terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Immediately Jesus said to them,“Have courage! It is I. Stop being afraid!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter answered him, “Lord, if it's you, order me to come to you on the water.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said,“Come on!” So Peter got down out of the boat, started walking on the water, and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when he noticed the strong wind, he was frightened. As he began to sink, he shouted, “Lord, save me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At once Jesus reached out his hand, caught him, and said to him,“You who have so little faith, why did you doubt?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As they got into the boat, the wind stopped blowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the men in the boat began to worship Jesus, saying, “You certainly are the Son of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They crossed over and came ashore at Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word throughout that region and brought him all who were sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They kept begging him to let them touch just the tassel of his garment, and all who touched it were completely healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
