For an angel of the Lord had come down from heaven, stepped forward, rolled the stone away, and was sitting on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because they were so afraid of him, the guards shook and became like dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the angel said to the women, “Stop being afraid! For I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here. He has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee, and you will see him there. Remember, I have told you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they quickly left the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Suddenly Jesus met them and said,“Greetings!” They went up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them,“Stop being afraid! Go and tell my brothers to leave for Galilee, and there they will see me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the high priests all that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they met with the elders and agreed on a plan to give the soldiers a large amount of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They said, “Say that his disciples came at night and stole him while you were sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If this is reported to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the hillside to which Jesus had directed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw him, they worshiped him, though some had doubts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jesus came up and said to them,“All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, as you go, disciple all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you each and every dayuntil the end of the age.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
