They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He answered them,“Haven't you read that the one who madethem at the beginning ‘made them male and female’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said, ‘That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, man must never separate.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They asked him, “Why, then, did Moses order us ‘to give a certificate of divorce and divorce her’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them,“It was because of your hardness of heart that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning it was not this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Itell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples said to him, “If that is the relationship of a man with his wife, it's not worth getting married!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them,“Not everyone can accept this saying, except those to whom celibacyhas been granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For some men are celibate from birth,while others are celibate because they have been made that way by others. Still others are celibate because they have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then some little children were brought to him so that he might lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus, however, said,“Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like these.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When he had laid his hands on them, he went on from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Just then a man came up to Jesus and said, “Teacher, what good deed should I do to have eternal life?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to him,“Why ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good.If you want to get into that life, you must keep the commandments.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The young man said to him, “Which ones?”Jesus said,“‘You must not murder,you must not commit adultery,you must not steal,you must not give false testimony,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>honor your father and mother,’and ‘you must love your neighbor as yourself.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said to him, “I have kept all of these. What do I still lack?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him,“If you want to be perfect, go and sell what you own and give the moneyto the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard this statement he went away sad, because he had many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples,“Truly I tell you, it will be hard for a rich person to get into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the disciples heard this, they were completely astonished and said, “Who, then, can be saved?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus looked at them intently and said,“For humans this is impossible, but for God all things are possible.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter said to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you. So what will we get?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said to them,“Truly I tell you, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the renewed creation, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, governing the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In fact, everyone who has left his homes, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or fields because of my name will receive a hundred times as muchand will inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
