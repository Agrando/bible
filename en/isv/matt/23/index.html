They increase the size of their phylacteriesand lengthen the tassels of their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They love to have the places of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to be greeted in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi’by people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“But you are not to be called ‘Rabbi,’for you have only one teacher, and all of you are brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And don't call anyone on earth ‘Father,’ for you have only one Father, the one in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Nor are you to be called ‘Teachers,’ for you have only one teacher, the Christ!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The person who is greatest among you must be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door to the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You don't go in yourselves, and you don't allow those who are trying to enter to go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over sea and land to make a single convert, and when this happens you make him twice as fit forhellas you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“How terrible it will be for you, blind guides! You say, ‘Whoever swears an oath by the sanctuary is excused,but whoever swears an oath by the gold of the sanctuary must keep his oath.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You blind fools! What is more important, the gold or the sanctuary that made the gold holy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Again you say,‘Whoever swears an oath by the altar is excused,but whoever swears by the gift that is on it must keep his oath.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You blind men!Which is more important, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, the one who swears an oath by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The one who swears an oath by the sanctuary swears by it and by the one who lives there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the one who swears an oath by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you give a tenth of your mint, dill, and cummin, but have neglected the more important matters of the law: justice, mercy, and faithfulness.These are the things you should have practiced, without neglecting the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You blind guides! You filter out a gnat, yet swallow a camel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but on the inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup,so that its outside may also be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs that look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead people's bones and every kind of impurity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In the same way, on the outside you look righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>“How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then you say, ‘If we had been living in the days of our ancestors, we would have had no part with them in sheddingthe blood of the prophets.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then finish what your ancestors started!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You snakes, you children of serpents! How can you escape being condemned to hell?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>“That is why I am sending you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will whip in your synagogues and persecute from town to town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As a result, you will be held accountable forall the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Truly I tell you, all these things will happen to this generation.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones to death those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you didn't want to!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Look! Your house is left to you deserted!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘How blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
