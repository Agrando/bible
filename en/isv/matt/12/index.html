His disciples became hungry and began picking heads of grain to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But he said to them,“Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>How is it that he went into the house of God and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him and his companions to eat but was reservedfor the priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or haven't you read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and yet are innocent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I tell you, something greater than the temple is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you had known what ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice’means, you would not have condemned the innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moving on from there, Jesus went into their synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Suddenly a man with a paralyzed hand appeared. The people asked Jesus if it was lawful to heal on the Sabbath, intending to accuse him of doing something wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them,“Is there a man among you who, if he had one sheep and it fell into a ditch on the Sabbath, wouldn't take hold of it and pull it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much more is a human being worth than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he said to the man,“Hold out your hand.” He held it out and it became normal, as healthy as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Pharisees, however, went out and plotted against Jesus to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Jesus became aware of this, he left that place. Many crowds followed him, and he healed all of them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>ordering them not to make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“Here is my Servant whom I have chosen,whom I love, and with whom my soul is pleased!	I will put my Spirit on him,and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will not quarrel or shout,and no one will hear his voice in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He will not snap off a broken reedor snuff out a smoldering wickuntil he brings justice to victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his name the Gentiles will hope.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and unable to talk was brought to him. Jesus healed him so that the man could speak and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All the crowds were amazed and kept saying, “This man isn't the Son of David, is he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He knew what they were thinking and said to them,“Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Soif Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How, then, can his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>IfI drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own followersdrive them out? That is why they will be your judges!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>How can someone go into a strong man's house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man? Then he can ransack his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>“The person who isn't with me is against me, and the person who doesn't gather with me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven,but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the one to come.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>“Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten. For a tree is known by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You children of serpents! How can you say anything good when you are evil? For the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A good person brings good things out of a good treasure, and an evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give an account for every thoughtlessword they utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But he replied to them,“An evil and adulterous generation craves a sign. Yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For just as Jonah was in the stomach of the sea creature for three days and three nights,so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of Nineveh will stand up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. But look—something greater than Jonah is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south will stand up with this generation at the judgment and will condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But look—something greater than Solomon is here!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>“Whenever an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it wanders through waterless places looking for a place to rest but finds none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then it says, ‘I will go back to my home that I left.’ When it arrives, it finds it empty, swept clean, and put in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and settle there. And so the final condition of that person becomes worse than the first. That's just what will happen to this evil generation!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Someone told him, “Look! Your mother and your brothers are standing outside asking to speak to you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He asked the man who told him,“Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then pointing with his hand at his disciples, he said,“Here are my mother and my brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
