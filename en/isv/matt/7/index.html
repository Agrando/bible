And with the measure you use,you will be measured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>“Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when the beam is in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly enough to remove the speck from your brother's eye.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>“Never give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs. Otherwise, they will trample them with their feet and then turn around and attack you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>“Keep asking, and it will be given to you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the doorwill be opened for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For everyone who keeps asking will receive, and the person who keeps searching will find, and the person who keeps knocking will have the dooropened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>“There isn't a person among you who would give his son a stone if he asked for bread, is there?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or if he asks for a fish, he wouldn't give him a snake, would he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who keep on asking him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, whatever you want people to do for you, do the same for them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>“Go in through the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the road is spacious that leads to destruction, and many people are entering by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How narrow is the gate and how constricted is the road that leads to life, and few are the people who find it!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheeps’ clothing but inwardly are savage wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By their fruit you will know them. Grapes aren't gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles, are they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces bad fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a rotten tree cannot produce good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So by their fruit you will know them.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“Not everyone who keeps saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will get into the kingdom of heaven, but only the person who keeps doing the will of my Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, we prophesied in your name, drove out demons in your name, and performed many miracles in your name, didn't we?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Get away from me, you evildoers!’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and obeys them is like a wise man who built his house on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it did not collapse because its foundation was on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“Everyone who hears these words of mine and doesn't obey them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and battered that house, and it collapsed, and its collapse was devastating.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When Jesus had finished saying all these things, the crowds were utterly amazed at his teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for he was teaching them like a person who had authority, and not like their scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
