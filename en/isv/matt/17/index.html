If you want, I will set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He was still speaking when a bright cloud suddenly overshadowed them. A voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him. Keep on listening to him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus came up to them and touched them, saying,“Get up, and stop being afraid.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus all by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On their way down the mountain, Jesus ordered them,“Don't tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the disciples asked him, “Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them,“Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I tell you that Elijah has already come, yet peopledid not recognize him and treated him just as they pleased. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that he had been speaking to them about John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, knelt down in front of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said, “Sir, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers terribly. Often he falls into fire and often into water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus replied,“You unbelieving and perverted generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy was healed that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why couldn't we drive it out?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He told them,“Because of your lack of faith.For truly I tell you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Butthis kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus told them,“The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They will kill him, but he will be raised on the third day.”Then they were filled with grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came up to Peter and said, “Your teacher pays the temple tax, doesn't he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered, “Yes.”When Peter went home, Jesus spoke to him first, saying,“What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings on the earth collect tolls or tributes? From their own subjects,or from foreigners?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him,“In that case, the subjectsare exempt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>However, so that we don't offend them, go to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, open itsmouth, and you will find a coin.Take it and give it to them for me and you.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
