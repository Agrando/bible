Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another that will not be torn down.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and said, “Tell us, when will these things take place, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus answered them,“See to it that no one deceives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For many will come in my name and say, ‘I am the Christ,’and they will deceive many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You are going to hear of wars and rumors of wars. See to it that you are not alarmed. These things must take place, but the end hasn't come yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But all these things are only the beginning of the birth pains.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>“Then they will hand you over to sufferingand will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nationsbecause of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then many people will fall by the way and will betray one another and hate one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and because lawlessness will increase, the love of many people will grow cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the person who endures to the end will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all nations,and then the end will come.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“So when you see the destructive desecration, mentioned by the prophet Daniel, standing in the Holy Place (let the reader take note),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The person who is on the housetop must not come down to get what is in his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the person who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>“How terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pray that it may not be in winter or on a Sabbath when you flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For at that time there will be great suffering,the kind that has not happened from the beginning of the world until now and certainly will never happen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If those days had not been limited, no life would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be limited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>“At that time, if anyone says to you, ‘Look! Here is the Christ!’or ‘There he is!’, don't believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For false christs and false prophets will appear and display great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Remember, I have told you this beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So if they say to you, ‘Look! He's in the wilderness,’ don't go out looking for him.And if they say, ‘Look! He's in the storeroom,’ don't believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherever there's a dead body, there the vultures will gather.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>“Immediately after the sufferingof those days,‘The sun will be darkened,the moon will not give its light,	the stars will fall from the sky,and the powers of heaven will be shaken loose.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn when they see ‘the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven’ with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He will send out his angels with a loud trumpet blast, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to another.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>“Now learn a lessonfrom the fig tree. When its branches become tender and it produces leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the same way, when you see all these things, you will know that he is near, right at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>“Truly I tell you, this generation will not disappear until these things happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>“No one knows when that day or hour will come—not the angels in heaven, nor the Son,but only the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>In those days before the flood, peoplewere eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage right up to the day when Noah went into the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They were unaware of what was happeninguntil the flood came and swept all of them away. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>At that time two people will be in the field. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two women will be grinding grain at the mill. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>“So keep on watching, because you don't know on what day your Lord is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But be sure of this: if the owner of the house had known at what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So you, too, must be ready, because at an hour you are not expecting him the Son of Man will come.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>“Who, then, is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household to give the otherstheir food at the right time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>How blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing this when he comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge of all his property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>“But if that wicked servant says to himself,‘My master has been delayed,’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and begins to beat his fellow servants and eat and drink with the drunks,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the master of that servant will come on a day when he doesn't expect him and at an hour that he doesn't know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then his masterwill punish him severelyand assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
