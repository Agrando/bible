If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So whenever you give to the poor, don't blow a trumpet before you like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they will be praised by people. Truly I tell you, they have their full reward!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>so that your giving may be done in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>“And whenever you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they will be seen by people. Truly I tell you, they have their full reward!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But whenever you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>“When you are praying, don't say meaningless words like the Gentiles do, for they think they will be heard because of their wordiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Don't be like them, because your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>“Therefore, this is how you should pray:‘Our Father in heaven,may your name be kept holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>May your kingdom come.May your will be done,on earth as it is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give us today our daily bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and forgive us our sins,as we have forgiven those who have sinned against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And never bring us into temptation,but deliver us from the evil one.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you forgive people their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you do not forgive people their offenses,your Father will not forgive your offenses.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“Whenever you fast, don't be gloomy like the hypocrites. For they put on sad faces to show others they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they have their full reward!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when you fast, put oil onyour head and wash your face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so that your fasting will not be noticed by others but by your Father who sees in secret. And your Father who is in secret will reward you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>“Stop storing up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But keep on storing up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where moths and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>“The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. Therefore, if the light in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“No one can serve two masters. For either he will hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and riches!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“That's why I'm telling you to stop worrying about your life—what you will eat or what you will drink—or about your body—what you will wear. Life is more than food, isn't it, and the body more than clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Look at the birds in the sky. They don't plant or harvest or gather food into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. You are more valuable than they are, aren't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Can any of you add a single hour to your span of lifeby worrying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why do you worry about clothes? Consider the lilies in the field and how they grow. They don't work or spin yarn,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now if that is the way God clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and thrown into an oven tomorrow, won't he clothe you much better—you who have little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“So don't ever worry by saying, ‘What are we going to eat?’ or ‘What are we going to drink?’ or ‘What are we going to wear?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For it is the Gentiles who are eager for all those things. Surely your heavenly Father knows that you need all of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But first be concerned about God's kingdom and his righteousness,and all of these things will be provided for you as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So never worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
