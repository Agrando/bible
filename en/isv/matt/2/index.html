We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When King Herod heard this he was troubled, and all the people of Jerusalem with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Christ was to be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea. For that is what was written by the prophet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>‘O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,you are by no means least among the rulers of Judah.	For from you will come a rulerwho will shepherd my people Israel.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod secretly called together the wise men and found out from them the time the star had appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “As you go, search carefully for the child. When you find him, tell me so that I, too, may go and worship him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After listening to the king, they set out, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they saw the star, they were ecstatic with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After they went into the house and saw the child with his mother Mary, they fell down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure sacks and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they left for their own country by a different road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and kill him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and left at night for Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He stayed there until Herod's death in order to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said, “Out of Egypt I called my Son.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he flew into a rage and ordered the execution of all the male children in Bethlehem and all its neighboring regions who were two years old and younger, according to the time that he had determined from the wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then what was declared by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“A voice was heard in Ramah:wailing and great mourning.	Rachel was crying for her children.She refused to be comforted,because they no longer existed.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But after Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and went into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and came and settled in a town called Nazareth in order to fulfill what was said by the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
