She has done a beautiful thing for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For you will always have the destitute with you, but you will not always have me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When she poured this perfume on my body, she was preparing me for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the high priests</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said, “What are you willing to give me if I betray him to you?” They placed before him thirty pieces of silver,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and from then on he began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples went to Jesus and said, “Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said,“Go to a certain man in the city and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.”’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When evening came, Jesus was sitting at the table with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>While they were eating, he said,“Truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Feeling deeply distressed, each one began to say to him, “Surely I am not the one, Lord?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He replied,“The man who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of Man is going away, just as it has been written about him, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Judas, who was going to betray him, said, “Rabbi, I'm not the one, am I?”Jesus said to him,“You have said so.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to the disciples, saying,“Take this and eat it. This is my body.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,“Drink from it, all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this is my blood of the newcovenant that is being poured out for many people for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I tell you, I will never again drink the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them,“All of you will turn against me this very night. For it is written,‘I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>However, after I have been raised, I will go to Galilee ahead of you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else turns against you, I certainly won't!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him,“Truly I tell you, this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter told him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane. He said to the disciples,“Sit down here while I go over there and pray.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, he began to be grieved and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he said to them,“My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake with me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Going on a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed,“O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not what I want but what you want.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When he went back to the disciples, he found them asleep. He said to Peter,“So, you mencouldn't stay awake with me for one hour, could you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>All of youmust stay awake and pray that you won't come into temptation. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He went away a second time and prayed,“My Father, if this cannot go away unless I drink it, let your will be done.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Again he came back and found them asleep, for their eyes were very heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>After leaving them again, he went away and prayed again for the third time, saying the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he came back to the disciples and said to them,“You might as well keep on sleeping and resting.Look! The time is near for the Son of Man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Getup! Let's go! See, the one who is betraying me is near!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. A large crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him. They were from the high priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now the betrayer personally had given them a signal, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So Judas immediately went up to Jesus and said, “Hello, Rabbi!” and kissed him tenderly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him,“Friend, why are you here?” Then the other men came forward, took hold of Jesus, and arrested him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Suddenly, one of the men with Jesus reached out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus said to him,“Put your sword back in its place! For all who use a sword will be killed by a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Don't you think that I could call on my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels now?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How, then, would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say this must happen?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>At this point Jesus said to the crowds,“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit?Day after day I sat teaching in the temple, yet you didn't arrest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all of this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.”Then all the disciples deserted him and ran away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Peter, however, followed him at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard. He went inside and sat down with the servants to see how this would end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Meanwhile, the high priests and the whole Council were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But they couldn't find any, even though many false witnesses had come forward. At last two men came forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and stated, “This man said, ‘I can destroy the sanctuary of God and rebuild it in three days.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>At this, the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Don't you have any answer to what these men are testifying against you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I command you by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him,“You have said so. Nevertheless I tell you,from now on‘you will see ‘the Son of Manseated at the right hand of Power’and‘coming on the clouds of heaven.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Look, you yourselves have just heard the blasphemy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What is your verdict?”They replied, “He deserves to die!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spit in his face and hit him. Some slapped him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is the one who hit you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, “You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied it in front of them all, saying, “I don't know what you're talking about.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>As he went out to the gateway, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus from Nazareth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Again he denied it and swore with an oath, “I don't know the man!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>After a little while the people who were standing there came up and said to Peter, “Obviously you're also one of them, because your accent gives you away.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to invoke a divine curse and to swear with an oath, “I don't know the man!” Just then a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>Peter remembered the words of Jesus when he said,“Before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” Then he went outside and cried bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
