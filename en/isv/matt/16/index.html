Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They began to discuss this among themselves and said, “We didn't take any bread.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Knowing this, Jesus said,“You who have little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you don't have any bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000 and how many baskets you collected,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>or the seven loaves for the 4,000 and how many baskets you collected?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How can you fail to understand that I wasn't talking to you about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the yeast used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus had come to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,“Who do people say the Son of Man is?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They said, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them,“But who do you say I am?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jesus said to him,“How blessed are you, Simon, son of John!For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I tell you that you are Peter,and it is on this rockthat I will build my church, and the forces of hellwill not overpower it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you prohibit on earth will have beenprohibitedin heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will have been permittedin heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he strictly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he would have to go to Jerusalem and suffer a great deal because of the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he would be killed, but on the third day he would be raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “God be merciful to you, Lord! This must never happen to you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Jesus turned around and said to Peter,“Get behind me, Satan! You are an offenseto me, for you are not thinking God's thoughts but human thoughts!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples,“If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what profit will a person have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what can a person give in exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>TheSon of Man is going to come with his angels in his Father's glory, and then he will repay everyone according to what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly I tell you, some people standing here will not experiencedeath before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
