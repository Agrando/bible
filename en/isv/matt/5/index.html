His disciples came to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and he opened his mouth and began to teach them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>“How blessed are those who are destitute in spirit,for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>“How blessed are those who mourn,for it is they who will be comforted!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>“How blessed are those who are humble,for it is they who will inherit the earth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>“How blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness,for it is they who will be satisfied!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>“How blessed are those who are merciful,for it is they who will receive mercy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“How blessed are those who are pure in heart,for it is they who will see God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>“How blessed are those who make peace,for it is they who will be called God's children!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>“How blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake,for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“How blessed are you whenever peopleinsult you, persecute you, and say all sorts of evil things against you falselybecause of me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Rejoice and be extremely glad, because your reward in heaven is great! For that's how they persecuted the prophets who came before you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>“You are the salt of the world. But if the salt should lose its taste, how can it be made salty again? It's good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled on by people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Peopledon't light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the same way, let your light shine before people in such a way that they will see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I didn't come to destroy them, but to fulfill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not one letteror one stroke of a letter will disappear from the Law until everything has been accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So whoever sets asideone of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I tell you, unless your righteousness greatly exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“You have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago, ‘You must not murder,’and ‘Whoever murders will be subject to punishment.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you, anyone who is angry with his brother without a causewill be subject to punishment. And whoever says to his brother ‘Raka!’will be subject to the Council.And whoever says ‘You fool!’ will be subject to hellfire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>“So if you are presenting your gift at the altar and remember there that your brother has something against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave your gift there before the altar and first go and be reconciled to your brother. Then come and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Come to terms quickly with your opponent while you are on the way to court,or your opponent may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you will be thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Truly I tell you, you will not get out of there until you pay back the last penny!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You must not commit adultery.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you, anyone who stares at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into hell.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say to you, any man who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>“Again, you have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago, ‘You must not swear an oath falsely,’ but ‘You must fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I tell you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, because it is God's throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, because it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nor should you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Instead, let your word be ‘Yes’ for ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ for ‘No.’ Anything more than that comes from the evil one.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I tell you not to resist an evildoer. On the contrary, whoever slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go two with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to the person who asks you for something, and do not turn away from the person who wants to borrow something from you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor’and hate your enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>so that you will become children of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and he lets rain fall on the righteous and the unrighteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the tax collectors do the same, don't they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you greet only your brothers, what great thing are you doing? Even the Gentilesdo the same, don't they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So be perfect,as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
