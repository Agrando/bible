At once you will find a donkey tied up and a colt with it. Untie them, and bring them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anyone says anything to you, tell him, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and that person will send them at once.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now this happened to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet when he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>“Tell the daughter of Zion,‘Look, your king is coming to you!	He is humble and mounted on a donkey,even on a colt of a donkey.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They brought the donkey and the colt and put their coats on them, and he sat upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Many people in the crowd spread their own coats on the road, while others began cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Both the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed him kept shouting,	“Hosanna to the Son of David!	How blessed is the one who comesin the name of the Lord!	Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was trembling with excitement. The people were asking, “Who is this?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The crowds kept saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, the man from Nazareth in Galilee.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jesus went into the temple, threw out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of those who sold doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He told them,“It is written, ‘My house is to be called a house of prayer,’but you are turning it into a hideoutfor bandits!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Blind and lame people came to him in the temple, and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the high priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he had done and the children shouting in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became furious</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and asked him, “Do you hear what these people are saying?”Jesus said to them,“Yes! Haven't you ever read, ‘From the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have created praise’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, he became hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Seeing a fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it,“May fruit never come from you again!” And immediately the fig tree dried up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said, “How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered them,“Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you be able to do what has been done to the fig tree, but you will also say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and it will happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You will receive whatever you ask for in prayer, if you believe.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus went into the temple. While he was teaching, the high priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus answered them,“I, too, will ask you one question.If you answer it for me, I will also tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Where did John's authority to baptizecome from? From heaven or from humans?”They began discussing this among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we say, ‘From humans,’ we are afraid of the crowd, for all regard John as a prophet.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they said to Jesus, “We don't know.”He in turn told them,“Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>“But what do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His sonreplied, ‘I don't want to,’ but later he changed his mind and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the fatherwent to the other sonand told him the same thing. He replied, ‘I will,sir,’ but he didn't go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two did the father's will?”They answered, “The first.”Jesus said to them,“Truly I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes will get into God's kingdom ahead of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, but you didn't believe him. The tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. But even when you saw that, you didn't change your mindsat last and believe him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>“Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a wall around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenant farmers to collect his produce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the farmers took his servants and beat one, killed another, and attacked another with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again, he sent other servants to them, a greater number than the first, but the tenant farmerstreated them the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking, ‘They will respect my son.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the tenant farmers saw his son, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come on, let's kill him and get his inheritance!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those farmers?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They said to him, “He will put those horrible men to a horrible death. Then he will lease the vineyard to other farmers who will give him his produce at harvest time.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them,“Have you never read in the Scriptures,‘The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone.	This was the Lord's doing,and it is amazing in our eyes’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>That is why I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce fruit for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The person who falls over this stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When the high priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was talking about them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Although they wanted to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, for they considered him a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
