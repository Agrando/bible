For they don't wash their hands when they eat.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But he answered them,“Why do you also disregard the commandment of God because of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God said,‘Honor your father and your mother,’and ‘Whoever curses father or mother must certainly be put to death.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say ‘Whoever tells his father or his mother, “Whatever support you might have received from me has been given to God,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>does not have to honor his father.’Because of your tradition, then, you have revoked the authority of God's word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You hypocrites! How well did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>‘These people honor me with their lips,but their hearts are far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their worship of me is empty,because they teach human rules as doctrines.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he called to the crowd and said to them,“Listen and understand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is not what goes into the mouth that makes a person unclean. It is what comes out of the mouth that makes a person unclean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you realize that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He replied,“Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be pulled up by the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind.If one blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a ditch.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Peter said to him, “Explain to us this parable.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said,“Are you still so ignorant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Don't you know that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and then is expelled as waste?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and it is those things that make a person unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is out of the heart that evil thoughts come, as well as murder, adultery, sexual immorality, stealing, false testimony, and slander.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating with unwashed hands doesn't make a person unclean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Suddenly a Canaanite woman from that territory came near and began to shout, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he didn't answer her at all. Then his disciples came up and kept urging him, “Send her away, for she keeps on screaming after us.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he replied,“I was sent only to the lost sheep of the nationof Israel.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then she came and fell down before him, saying, “Lord, help me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He replied,“It is not rightto take the children's bread and throw it to the puppies.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said, “Yes, Lord. But even the puppies eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ tables.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered her,“O woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.” That very hour her daughter was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a hillside and sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those unable to talk, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As a result, the crowd was amazed to see those who were unable to talk speaking, the crippled healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. So they praised the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus called his disciples and said,“I have compassion for the crowd because they have already been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away without food, or they may faint on the road.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples asked him, “Where in the wilderness are we to get enough bread to feed such a crowd?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them,“How many loaves of bread do you have?”They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>All of them ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up what was left of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>After he sent the crowds away, he got into a boat and went to the region of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
