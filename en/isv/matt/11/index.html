A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Really, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? See, those who wear fancy clothes live in kings’ houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Really, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is the man about whom it is written,‘See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,who will prepare your way before you.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly I tell you, among those born of women no one has appeared who is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“From the days of John the Baptist until the present, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing,and violent people have been attacking it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the Law and all the Prophets prophesied up to the time of John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let the person who has earslisten!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“To what can I compare this generation? It's like little children who sit in the marketplaces and shout to each other,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>‘A wedding song we played for you,the dance you did but scorn.	A woeful dirge we chanted, too,but then you would not mourn.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John didn't come eating or drinking, yetpeoplesay, ‘He has a demon!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’Absolved from every act of sin,is wisdom by her kith and kin.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had taken place, because they didn't repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that happened in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Indeed I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Capernaum! You won't be lifted up to heaven, will you? You'll go down to Hades!For if the miracles that happened in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Indeed I tell you, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus said,“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent people and have revealed them to infants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, Father, for this is what was pleasing to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one fully knows the Son except the Father, and no one fully knows the Father except the Son and the person to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>“Come to me, all of you who are weary and loaded down with burdens, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Place my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is pleasant,and my burden is light.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
