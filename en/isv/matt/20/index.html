He went out again about noonand about three o'clockand did the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>About five o'clockhe went out andfound some others standing around. He said to them, ‘Why are you standing here all day long without work?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They told him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard as well.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and give them their wages, beginning with the last and ending withthe first.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those who were hired at five o'clockcame, and each received a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the first came, they thought they would receive more, but each received a denarius as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they received it, they began to complain to the landowner,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, ‘These last fellows worked only one hour, yet you have made them equal to us who have endured the burden of the day and the scorching heat!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he said to one of them, ‘Friend, I'm not treating you unfairly. You did agree with me for a denarius, didn't you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take what is yours and go. I want to give this last man as much as I gave you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I am allowed to do what I want with my own money,am I not? Or is your eye evilbecause I am good?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the same way, the last will be first, and the first will be last. For many are called, but few are chosen.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them on the way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked, whipped, and crucified, but on the third day he will be raised.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Jesus with her sons. She bowed down in front of him to ask him for a favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He asked her,“What do you want?”She said to him, “Promise that these two sons of mine will sit, one at your right and one at your left, in your kingdom.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus replied,“You don't realize what you're asking. Can you drink from the cup that I'm going to drink from?”They told him, “We can.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them,“You will indeed drink from my cup. But it's not up to me to grant you a seat at my right hand or at my left. These positions have already been prepared for others by my Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the ten heard this, they became furious with the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called the disciples and said,“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their superiors act like tyrants over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That's not the way it should be among you. Instead, whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>That's the way it is with the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When two blind men who were sitting by the roadside heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The crowd sternly told them to be silent, but they shouted even louder, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus stopped and called them, saying,“What do you want me to do for you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They told him, “Lord, let our eyes be opened!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Jesus, deeply moved with compassion, touched their eyes and at once they could see again. So they followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
