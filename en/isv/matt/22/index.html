He said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>“The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding, but they refused to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Sohe sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Look, I've prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened calves have been slaughtered. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding!”’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they paid no attention to this and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therest grabbed theking'sservants, treated them brutally, and then killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the king became outraged. He sent his troops, and they destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So go into the roads leading out of town and invite as many people as you can find to the wedding.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Those servants went out into the streets and brought in all the people they found, evil and good alike, and the wedding hall was packed with guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“When the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But the manwas speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king told his servants, ‘Tie his hands and feet, and throw him into the outer darkness! In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are invited, but few are chosen.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went and planned how to trap Jesus in conversation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. They said, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere and that you teach the way of God truthfully. You don't favor any individual, for you pay no attention to external appearance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So tell us what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jesus recognized their wickedness and said,“Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me the coin used for the tax.”They brought him a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he asked them,“Whose face and name is this?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said to him, “Caesar's.”So he said to them,“Then give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they heard this, they were amazed. Then they left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That same day some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“Teacher, Moses said, ‘If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for his brother.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his widow to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The same thing happened with the second brother, and then the third, and finally with the rest of the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Finally, the woman died, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be, since all of them had married her?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered them,“You are mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection, peopleneither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angelsin heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for the resurrection from the dead, haven't you read what was spoken to you by God when he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?Heis not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they met together in the same place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>One of them, an expert in the law, tested him by asking,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him,“‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the greatest and most importantcommandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The second is like it: ‘You must love your neighbor as yourself.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were still gathered, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>“What do you think about the Christ?Whose son is he?”They told him, “David's.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He asked them,“Then how can David by the Spirit call him ‘Lord’ when he says,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,until I put your enemies under your feet”’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If David calls him 'Lord', how can he be his son?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>No one could answer him at all, and from that day on no one dared to ask him another question.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
