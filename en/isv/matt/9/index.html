When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,“Be courageous, son! Your sins are forgiven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then some of the scribes said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus knew their thoughts and said,“Why do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For which is easier: to say ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I want you to knowthat the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”Then he said to the paralyzed man,“Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the man got up and went home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the crowds saw this, they became frightened and glorified God for giving such authority to humans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's desk and said to him,“Follow me.” So he got up and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>While he was having dinner at Matthew's home, many tax collectors and sinners arrived and began eating with Jesus and his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Jesus heard that, he said,“Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick people do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go and learn what this means: ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice.’For I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then John's disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to them,“The wedding guests can't mourn as long as the groom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nor do peoplepour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill out, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While Jesus was telling them these things, an official came up, fell down before him, and said, “My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Jesus got up and followed him, along with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Just then a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel of his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For she had been saying to herself, “If I just touch his robe, I will get well.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When Jesus turned and saw her, he said,“Be courageous, daughter! Your faith has made you well.” And from that very hour the woman was well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When Jesus came to the official's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>he said,“Go away! The girl hasn't died but is sleeping.” They laughed and laughed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the crowd had been driven outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The news of this spread throughout that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As Jesus was traveling on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him.Jesus asked them,“Do you believe I can do this?”They said to him, “Yes, Lord!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he touched their eyes and said,“According to your faith, let it be done for you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened.Then Jesus sternly told them,“See to it that nobody knows about this.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As they were going out, a man who couldn't talk because he was demon-possessed was brought to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As soon as the demon had been driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees kept saying, “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus began traveling through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When he saw the crowds, he was deeply moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he said to his disciples,“The harvest is vast, but the workers are few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
