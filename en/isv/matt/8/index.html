Be made clean!” And instantly his leprosy was made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jesus said to him,“See to it that you don't speak to anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Jesus returned to Capernaum, a centurion came up to him and begged him repeatedly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>“Sir, my servant is lying at home paralyzed and in terrible pain.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to him,“I will come and heal him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The centurion replied, “Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one ‘Go’ and he goes, to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my servant ‘Do this’ and he does it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him,“Truly I tell you, not evenin Israel have I found this kind of faith!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I tell you, many will come from east and west and will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the citizensof that kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus said to the centurion,“Go. It will be done for you just as you have believed.” And his servant was healed that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus went into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, sick with a fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began serving him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When evening came, people brought to him many who were possessed by demons. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all those who were sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,	“It was he who took our illnesses awayand removed our diseases.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When Jesus saw the large crowds around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus told him,	“Foxes have holes and birds have nests,but the Son of Man has no place to rest.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus told him,“Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When Jesus got into the boat, his disciples went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat began to be swamped by the waves. Yet Jesus kept sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They went to him and woke him up, saying, “Lord, save us! We're going to die!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said to them,“Why are you afraid, you who have little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The men were amazed and said, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gerasenes, two demon-possessed men met him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could travel on that road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Suddenly they screamed, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Did you come here to torture us before the proper time?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now a large herd of pigs was grazing some distance away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the demons began to plead with Jesus, saying, “If you drive us out, send us into that herd of pigs.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He said to them,“Go,” and they came out and went into the pigs. Suddenly, the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they came into the city and reported everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and as soon as they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
