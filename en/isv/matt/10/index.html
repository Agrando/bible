Without payment you have received; without payment you are to give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Don't take any gold, silver, or copper in your moneybags,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>or a traveling bag for the trip, or an extra shirt,or sandals, or a walking stick. For a worker deserves his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you leave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As you enter the house, greet it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If the house is receptive,let your blessing of peace come on it. But if it isn't receptive,let your blessing of peace return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If no one welcomes you or listens to your words, as you leave that house or town, shake its dust off your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“See, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as cunning as serpents and as innocent as doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Watch out for people, for they will hand you over to the local councils and whip you in their synagogues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because of me you will be brought before governors and kings to testify to them and the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When they hand you over, don't worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say, for in that hour what you are to say will be given to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it won't be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking throughyou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“Brother will hand brother over to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against parents and have them put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the person who endures to the end will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So when they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. For truly I tell you, you certainly will not have gone through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“A disciple is not above his teacher, and a slave is not above his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher and a slave to be like his master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they do the same tothose of his household!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“So never be afraid of them. For there is nothing covered that will not be exposed, and nothing secret that will not be made known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What I tell you in darkness you must speak in the daylight, and what is whisperedin your ear you must shout from the housetops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Stop beingafraid of those who kill the body but can't kill the soul. Instead, be afraid of the one who can destroy both body and soul in hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>“Two sparrows are sold for a penny, aren't they? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's permission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Indeed, even the hairs on your head have all been counted!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So stop beingafraid. You are worth more than a bunch of sparrows.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>“Therefore, everyone who acknowledges me before people I, too, will acknowledge before my Father in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But whoever denies me before people I, too, will deny before my Father in heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>“Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I came to turn‘a man against his father,a daughter against her mother,and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A person's enemies will be members of his own family.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>“The one who loves his father or mother more than me isn't worthy of me, and the one who loves a son or daughter more than me isn't worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The one who doesn't take up his cross and follow me isn't worthy of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Theone who finds his life will lose it, and the one who loses his life because of me will find it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>“The one who receives you receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The one who receives a prophet asa prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person asa righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Truly I tell you, whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he isa disciple will never lose his reward.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
