Come out to meet him!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all the bridesmaidswoke up and got their lamps ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise ones replied, ‘No! There will never be enough for us and for you. Better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>“While they were away buying it, the groom arrived. Those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet, and the door was closed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Later the other bridesmaidsarrived and said, ‘Lord, lord, open up for us!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he replied, ‘Truly I tell you, I don't know you!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So keep on watching, because you don't know the day or the hour.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>“For it is like a man going on a trip who called his servants and turned his money over to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To one man he gave five talents,to another two, and to another one, based on their ability. Then he went on his trip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“The one who received five talents went out at once and invested them and earned five more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the same way, the one who had two talents earned two more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the one who received one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and hid his master's money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>“After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The one who had received five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, ‘Master, you gave me five talents. See, I've earned five more talents.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy servant! Since you have been trustworthy with a small amount, I will put you in charge of a large amount. Come and share your master's joy!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>“The one with two talents also came forward and said, ‘Master, you gave me two talents. See, I've earned two more talents.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and trustworthy servant! Since you have been trustworthy with a small amount, I will put you in charge of a large amount. Come and share your master's joy!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“Then the one who had received one talent came forward and said, ‘Master, I knew that you were a hard man, harvesting where you haven't planted and gathering where you haven't scattered any seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Being afraid, I went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here, take what is yours!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“His master answered him, ‘You evil and lazy servant! So you knew that I harvested where I haven't planted and gathered where I haven't scattered any seed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then you should have invested my money with the bankers. When I returned, I would have received my money back with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take the talent from him and give it to the man who has the ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For to everyone who has something, more will be given, and he will have more than enough. But from the person who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Throw this useless servant into the outer darkness! In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels are with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>All the nations will be assembled in front of him, and he will separate them from each other as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will put the sheep on his right but the goats on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>“Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who have been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>“Then the righteous will say to him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and give you something to eat, or thirsty and give you something to drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When did we see you as a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The king will answer them, ‘Truly I tell you, in that you did it for one of the least important of these my brothers, you did it for me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>“Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Get away from me, you who are accursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I was a stranger, and you didn't welcome me. I was naked, and you didn't clothe me. I was sick and in prison, and you didn't visit me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>“Then they will reply, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or as a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and didn't help you?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he will say to them, ‘Truly I tell you, in that you did not do it for one of the least important of these, you did not do it for me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These people will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will gointo eternal life.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
