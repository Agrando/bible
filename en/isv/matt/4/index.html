For it is written,	‘God will put his angels in charge of you,’and	‘With their hands they will hold you up,so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to him,“It is also written,‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Once more the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to Jesus, “I will give you all of these things if you will bow down and worship me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to him,“Go away,Satan! For it is written,‘You must worship the Lord your Godand serve only him.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the devil left him, and angels came and began ministering to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he went back to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He left Nazareth and went and settled in Capernaum by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in order to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“O Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,on the road to the sea, across the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The people living in darkness have seen a great light,and for those living in the land and shadow of death,a light has risen.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From then on, Jesus began to preach and to say,“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers—Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said to them,“Follow me, and I will make you fishermen of people!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So at once they left their nets and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Going on from there he saw two other brothers—James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee repairing their nets. When he called them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him all who were sick—those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralyzed—and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from across the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
