Rather, we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice of the Majestic Glory was conveyed to him as follows: “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus we regard the message of the prophets as confirmed beyond doubt, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp that is shining in a gloomy place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>First of all, you must understand this: No prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>because no prophecy ever originated through a human decision. Instead, men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
