May grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior be yours!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The reason I left you in Crete was to complete what still needed to be done and to appoint elders in every city, as I myself commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An elder must be blameless. He must be the husband of one wife and have children who are believers and who are not accused of having wild lifestyles or of being rebellious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because an overseer is God's administrator, he must be blameless. He must not be arrogant or irritable. He must not drink too much, be a violent person, or use shameful ways to make money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Instead, he must be a lover of strangers, a lover of goodness, sensible, honest, moral, and self-controlled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He must be devoted to the trustworthy message that is in agreement with our teaching, so that he may be able to encourage others with healthy doctrine and refute those who oppose it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For there are many people who are rebellious, especially those who are converts from Judaism. They speak utter nonsense and deceive people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They must be silenced, because they are the kind of people who ruin whole families by teaching what they should not teach in order to make money in a shameful way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One of their very own prophets said,	“Liars ever, men of Crete,Savage brutes that live to eat.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>That testimony is true. For this reason, refute them sharply so that they may become healthy in the faith</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and not pay attention to Jewish myths or commands given by people who reject the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everything is clean to those who are clean, but nothing is clean to those who are corrupt and unbelieving. Indeed, their very way of thinking and their consciences have been corrupted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They claim to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified to do anything good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
