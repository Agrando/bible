Instead, they are to be gentle and show perfect courtesy to everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>After all, we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, and misled. We were slaves to many kinds of lusts and pleasures, spending our days in malice and jealousy. We were despised, and we hated one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>However,	In grace our Savior God appeared,His love for mankind to make clear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>â€˜Twas not for deeds that we had done, But by his steadfast love alone,	He saved us through a second birth,Renewed us by the Spirit's work,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And poured him out upon us, too,Through Jesus Christ our Savior true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And so, made right by his own grace,Eternal life we now embrace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have put their faith in God may devote themselves to good works. These things are good and helpful to other people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But avoid foolish controversies, arguments about genealogies, quarrels, and fights about the law. These things are useless and worthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have nothing to do with a person who causes divisions after you have warned him once or twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For you know that a person like this is corrupt and keeps on sinning, being self-condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As soon as I send Artemas to you, or perhaps Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do all you can to send Zenas the expert in the law and Apollos on their way, and see that they have everything they need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Our own people should also learn to devote themselves to good works when urgent needs arise, lest they be unproductive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. May grace be with all of you! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
