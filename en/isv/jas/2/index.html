God has chosen the poor in the world to become rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him, has he not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you have humiliated the man who is poor. Are not rich people the ones who oppress you and drag you into court?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Are not they the ones who blaspheme the excellent name by which you have been called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless, you are doing the right thing if you obey the royal law in keeping with the Scripture, “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and will be convicted by the law as violators.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the one who said, “Never commit adultery,” also said, “Never murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but you murder, you become a violator of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You must make it your habit to speak and act like people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For merciless judgment will come to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What good does it do, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith but does not have any works? This kind of faith cannot save him, can it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Suppose a brother or sister does not have any clothes or daily food</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you tells them, “Go in peace! Stay warm and eat heartily.” If you do not provide for their bodily needs, what good does it do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the same way, faith by itself, if it does not have any works, is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But someone may say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without any works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that there is one God. That's fine! Even the demons believe that and tremble with fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do you want proof, you foolish person, that faith without works is worthless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Our ancestor Abraham was justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar, wasn't he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see that his faith was active with his works, and by his works faith was made complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And so the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.” And so he was called God's friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise, Rahab the prostitute was justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them away on a different road, wasn't she?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
