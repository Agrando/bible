If someone does not make any mistakes when he speaks, he is perfect and able to control his whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now if we put bits into horsesâ€™ mouths to make them obey us, we can guide their whole bodies as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And look at ships! They are so big that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are steered wherever the pilot pleases by a tiny rudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it can boast of great achievements. A huge forest can be set on fire by a little flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The tongue is a fire, a world of evil. Placed among the parts of our bodies, the tongue contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the course of life, and is itself set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures can be or have been tamed by the human species,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but no one can tame the tongue. It is an uncontrollable evil filled with deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in God's likeness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. It should not be like this, my brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A spring cannot pour both fresh and brackish water from the same opening, can it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives, nor a grapevine figs, can it? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good life that his works are done in humility born of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and rivalry in your hearts, stop boasting and lying against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That kind of wisdom does not come from above. No, it is worldly, self-centered, and demonic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For wherever jealousy and rivalry exist, there is disorder and every kind of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>However, the wisdom that comes from above is first of all pure, then peace-loving, gentle, willing to yield, full of compassion and good fruits, and without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a harvest of righteousness is grown from the seed of peace planted by peacemakers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
