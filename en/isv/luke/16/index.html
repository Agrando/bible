Give me a report about your management, because you can't be my manager any longer.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>“Then the manager said to himself, ‘What should I do? My master is taking my position away from me. I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg. 4I know what I'll do so that peoplewill welcome me into their homes when I'm dismissed from my job.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>“So he called for each of his master's debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The man replied, ‘A hundred jars of olive oil.’ The manager told him, ‘Get your bill. Sit down quickly and write “fifty.”’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he asked another debtor,‘How much do you owe?’ The man replied, ‘A hundred containers of wheat.’ The managertold him, ‘Get your bill and write “eighty.”’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The master praised the dishonest manager for being so clever. For worldly peopleare more clever than enlightened peoplein dealing with their own generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“I'm telling you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous riches,so that when they're gone you'll be welcomedinto eternal homes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whoever is faithful with very little is also faithful with a lot, and whoever is dishonest with very little is also dishonest with a lot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So if you have not been faithful with unrighteous riches,who will trust you with true wealth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if you have not been faithful with what belongs to foreigners, who will give you what is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“No servant can serve two masters. For either he will hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and riches!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the Pharisees, who love money, had been listening to all this and began to ridicule Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he said to them,“You try to justify yourselves in front of people, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly valued by people is detestable to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“The law and the Prophets were prophesyinguntil the time ofJohn. Since then, the good news about the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone is trying to enter it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>However, it is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for one stroke of a letter in the law to be dropped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“Once there was a rich man who used to dress in purple and fine linen and live in great luxury every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A beggar named Lazarus, who was covered with sores, was brought to his gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He was always craving to satisfy his hunger with what fellfrom the rich man's table. In fact, even the dogs used to come and lick his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“One day the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In Hades,where he was in constant torture, he looked up and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus by his side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he shouted, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and to cool off my tongue, because I am suffering in this fire.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Abraham said, ‘My child, remember that during your lifetime you received blessings,while Lazarus received hardships.But now he is being comforted here, while you suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Besides all this, a wide chasm has been fixed between us, so that those who want to cross from this side to you can't do so, nor can they cross from your side to us.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“The rich mansaid, ‘Then I beg you, father, send him to my father's house—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for I have five brothers—to warn them, so that they won't end up in this place of torture, too.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets. They should listen to them!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the rich manreplied, ‘No, father Abraham! Yet if someone from the dead went to them, they would repent.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Abrahamsaid to him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded, even if someone rises from the dead.’”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
