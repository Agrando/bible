Then he sat down and began to teach the crowds from the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon,“Push out into deep water, and lower your nets for a catch.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Simon answered, “Master, we have worked hard all night and caught nothing. But if you say so, I'll lower the nets.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After the men had done this, they caught so many fish that the nets began to tear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats until the boats began to sink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus’ knees and said, “Leave me, Lord! I am a sinful man!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For Simon and all the people who were with him were amazed at the number of fish they had caught,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and so were James and John, Zebedee's sons and Simon's partners.Then Jesus said to Simon,“Stop being afraid. From now on you will be catching people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So when they brought the boats to shore, they left everything and followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One day while Jesus was in one of the cities, a man covered with leprosy saw Jesus and fell on his face, begging him, “Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying,“I do want to. Be made clean!” Instantly the leprosy left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus ordered him,“Don't tell anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing as Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the news about Jesus spread even more, and many crowds began gathering to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>However, he continued his habit of retiring to deserted places and praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One day as Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of the law happened to be sitting near by. The people had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was present to heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Some men were bringing a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They were trying to take him into the house and place him in front of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When they couldn't find a way to get him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down on his stretcher through the tiles into the middle of the room, right in front of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Jesus saw their faith, he said,“Mister,your sins are forgiven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The scribes and the Pharisees began to argue among themselves, saying, “Who is this man who is uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because Jesus knew that they were arguing, he said to them,“Why are you arguing about this among yourselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whichis easier: to say ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and walk’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>ButI want you to knowthat the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”Then he said to the paralyzed man,“I say to you: Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the man immediately stood up in front of them and picked up what he had been lying on. Then he went home, praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Amazement seized all the people, and they began to praise God. They were filled with fear and declared, “We have seen wonderful things today!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After that, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax collector's desk. He said to him,“Follow me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Levi left everything behind, got up, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Levi gave a large banquet at his home for Jesus. A large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The Pharisees and their scribes started complaining to Jesus’ disciples, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Jesus answered them,“Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick people do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I have not come to call righteous people, but sinners, to repentance.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they said to him, “John's disciples frequently fast and pray, and so do those of the Pharisees. But your disciples keep right on eating and drinking.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Jesus said to them,“You can't force the wedding guests to fast while the groom is still with them, can you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and in those days they will fast.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he told them a parable:“No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, the new will tear, and the piece from the new will not match the old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will make the skins burst, the winewill be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Rather, new wine is to be poured into fresh wineskins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>No one who has been drinking old wine wants new wine, for he says, ‘The old is excellent!’”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
