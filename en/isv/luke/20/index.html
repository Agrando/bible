But the farmers beat him and sent him back empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He sent another servant, and they beat him, too, treated him shamefully, and sent him back empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he sent a third, and they wounded him and threw him out, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>“Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I'll send my son whom I love. Maybe they'll respect him.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the farmers saw him, they talked it over among themselves and said, ‘This is the heir. Let's kill him so that the inheritance will be ours!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others.” Those who heard him said, “That must never happen!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus R	‘The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush anyone on whom it falls.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When the scribes and the high priests realized that he had told this parable against them, they wanted to lay their hands on him at that very hour, but they were afraid of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended to be honest men in order to trap him in what he would say. They wanted to hand him over to the power and authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they asked him, “Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you don't favor any individual, but teach the way of God truthfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he detected their cunning and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“Show me a denarius. Whose face and name does it have?”They said, “Caesar's.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he said to them,“Then give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So they couldn't catch him before the people in what he said. Amazed at his answer, they became silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, the man should marry the widow and have children for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the second</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the third married her. In the same way, all seven died and left no children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Finally, the woman died, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now in the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be, since the seven had married her?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them,“Those who belong to this age marry and are married,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nor can they die anymore, for they are like the angels and, since they share in the resurrection, are God's children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Even Moses demonstrated in the story about the bush that the dead are raised, when he calls the Lord ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Heis not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all people are alive to him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then some of the scribes replied, “Teacher, you have given a fine answer.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For they no longer dared to ask him another question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he said to them,“How can peoplesay that the Christis David's son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For David himself in the book of Psalms says,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So David calls him 'Lord.' Then how can he be his son?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>While all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>“Beware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>They devour widows’ housesand say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
