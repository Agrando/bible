For many will come in my name and say, ‘I am he’ and ‘The time is near.’ Don't go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When you hear of wars and revolutions, never be alarmed. For these things must take place first, but the end won't come right away.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he went on to say to them,“Nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There will be great earthquakes and famines and plagues in various places, and there will be fearful events and awful signs from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“But before all these things take place, peoplewill arrest you and persecute you.
