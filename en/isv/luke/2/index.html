She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was not any room for them in the inn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, watching their flock during the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the angel said to them, “Stop being afraid! Listen! I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Today your Savior, Christ the Lord, was born in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Suddenly a multitude of the Heavenly Army appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>“Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to people who enjoy his favor!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let's go to Bethlehem and see what has taken place that the Lord has told us about.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they went quickly and found Mary and Joseph with the baby, who was lying in the manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw this, they repeated what they had been told about this child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but Mary continued to treasure in her heart all these things and to ponder them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the shepherds returned to their flock, glorifying and praising God for everything they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After eight days had passed, the child was circumcised and named Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn son is to be designated as holy to the Lord.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They also offered a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord: “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now a man named Simeon was in Jerusalem. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the one who would comfort Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die until he had seen the Lord's Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple. When the parents brought the child Jesus to do for him what was customary under the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Simeon took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>“Master, now you are allowing your servant to leave in peaceaccording to your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my eyes have seen your salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>which you prepared for all people to see—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>a light that will reveal salvation to the Gentiles		and bring glory to your people Israel.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus’ father and mother kept wondering at the things being said about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall or rise. He will be a sign that will be disputed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>so that the inner thoughts of many people might be revealed. Indeed, a sword will pierce your own soul, too.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now Anna, a prophetess, was also there. She was a descendant of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having lived with her husband for seven years after her marriage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and then as a widow for eighty-four years. She never left the temple, but continued to worship there night and day with times of fasting and prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Just then she came forward and began to thank God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>After doing everything required by the law of the Lord, Joseph and Mary returned to their hometown of Nazareth in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Meanwhile, the child continued to grow and to become strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God's favor was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Every year Jesus’ parents would go to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When he was twelve years old, they went up to the festival as usual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When the days of the festival were over, they left for home. The young man Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>They thought that he was in the group of travelers. After traveling for a day, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching desperately for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Three days later they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All who heard him were amazed at his intelligence and his answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When his parents saw him, they were shocked. His mother asked him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been worried sick looking for you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He said to them,“Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I had to be in my Father's house?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But they did not understand what he said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then he went down with them and returned to Nazareth; and he remained in submission to them. His mother continued to treasure all these things in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Meanwhile, Jesus kept on growing in wisdom and maturity, and in favor with God and his fellow man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
