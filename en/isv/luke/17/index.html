If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Even if he sins against you seven times in a day and comes back to you seven times and says, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the apostles said to the Lord, “Give us more faith!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Lord replied,“If you have faith the size of amustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>“Suppose a man among you has a servant plowing or watching sheep. Would he say to him when he comes in from the field, ‘Come at once and have something to eat’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Of course not. Instead, he would say to him, ‘Get dinner ready for me, and put on your apron and wait on me until I eat and drink. Then you can eat and drink.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He doesn't praise the servant for doing what was commanded, does he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That's the way it is with you. When you have done everything you were ordered to do, say, ‘We are worthless servants. We have done only what we ought to have done.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>One day, Jesus was traveling along the border between Samaria and Galilee on the way to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As he was going into a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and shouted, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he saw them, he told them,“Go and show yourselves to the priests.” While they were going, they were made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But one of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back and praised God with a loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He fell on his face at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. Now the man was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus asked,“Ten men were made clean, weren't they? Where are the other nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was none of them found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he told the man,“Get up, and go home! Your faith has made you well.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come. He answered them,“The kingdom of God is not coming with a visible display.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Peoplewon't say, ‘Look! Here it is!’ or “There it is!’ For the kingdom of God is amongyou.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he said to the disciples,“The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Peoplewill say to you, ‘Look! There he is!’ or ‘Look! Here he is!’ Don't go and chase after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For just as lightning flashes and shines from one end of the sky to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer a great deal and be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“Just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peoplewere eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage right up to the day when Noah went into the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So it was in the days of Lot. Peoplewere eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But on the day when Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained from heaven and destroyed all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The day when the Son of Man is revealed will be like that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“The person who is on the housetop that day must not come down to get the belongings out of his house. The person in the field, too, must not turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever tries to save his lifewill lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you, two people will be in the same bed that night. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two woman will be grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then they asked him, “Where, Lord, will this take place?”He told them,“Wherever there's a dead body, there the vultures will gather.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
