He was also hoping to see some sign done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he continued to question him for a long time, but Jesus gave him no answer at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Meanwhile, the high priests and the scribes stood by and continued to accuse him vehemently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt and made fun of him. Then he put a magnificent robe on him and sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day. Before this they had been enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate called the high priests, the other leaders, and the people together</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one who turns the people against the government. And here in your presence I have examined him and have found him “Not Guilty” of the charges you make against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor does Herod, for he sent him back to us. Indeed, he has done nothing to deserve death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So I will punish him and let him go.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now he was obligated to release someone for them at the festival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they all shouted out together, “Away with this man! Release Barabbas for us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(This was a man who had been put in prison for a revolt that had taken place in the city and for murder.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Pilate wanted to let Jesus go, so he appealed to them again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but they continued to shout, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he spoke to them a third time: “What has he done wrong? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. So I will punish him and let him go.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they kept pressing him with loud shouts, demanding that Jesus be crucified, and their shouts began to prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Pilate pronounced his sentence that their demand should be carried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he released the man who had been put in prison for revolt and murder—the man they continued to demand—but he let them have their way with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As they led him away, they took hold of Simon, a man from Cyrene, as he was coming in from the country, and they put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A large crowd of people followed him, including some women who kept beating their breasts and wailing for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus turned to them and said,“Womenof Jerusalem, stop crying for me, but cry for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the days are surely coming when peoplewill say, ‘How blessed are the women who couldn't bear children and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’, and to the hills, ‘Cover us up!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they reached the place called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus kept saying,“Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they're doing.” Then they divided his clothes among them by throwing dice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Meanwhile, the people stood looking on. Even the leaders were mocking him and saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Christ of God, whom he has chosen!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The soldiers also made fun of him, coming up and offering him sour wine</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There was also an inscription over him written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “This is the King of the Jews.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now one of the criminals hanging there kept insulting him, saying, “You are the Christ, aren't you? Save yourself and us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Aren't you afraid of God, since you are suffering the same penalty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>We have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then he went on to say, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus said to him,“Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It was already about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>because the sun had stopped shining. And the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said,“Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit.” After he said this, he breathed his last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, “This man certainly was righteous!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When all the crowds who had come together for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they beat their breasts and turned back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, were standing at a distance watching these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>he had not voted for their plan and action—from the Jewish town of Arimathea; and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb cut in the rock, in which no one had yet been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was just beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>So the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee, following close behind, saw the tomb and how his body was laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then they went back and prepared spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
