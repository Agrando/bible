The guests were watching Jesus closely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A man whose body was swollen with fluid suddenly appeared in front of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law,“Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they kept silent. So he took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then he asked them,“If your sonor ox falls into a well on the Sabbath day, you would pull him out immediately, wouldn't you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they couldn't argue with him about this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When Jesus noticed how the guests were choosing the places of honor, he told them a parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, don't sit down at the place of honor in case someone more important than you was invited by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the host who invited both of you would come to you and say, ‘Give this person your place.’ In disgrace, you would have to take the place of least honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when you are invited, go and sit down at the place of least honor. Then, when your host comes, he will tell you, ‘Friend, move up higher,’ and you will be honored in the presence of all who eat with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the person who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he told the man who had invited him,“When you give a luncheon or a dinner, stop inviting onlyyour friends, brothers, relatives, or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may invite you in return and you would be repaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Instead, when you give a banquet, make it your habit to invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then you will be blessed because they can't repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now one of those eating with him heard this and said to him, “How blessed is the person who will eat in the kingdom of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to him,“A man gave a large banquet and invited many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who were invited, ‘Come! Everything is now ready.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every single one of them began asking to be excused. The first said to him, ‘I bought a field, and I need to go out and inspect it. Please excuse me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Another said, ‘I bought five pairs of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Still another said, ‘I recently got married, and that's why I can't come.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“So the servant went back and reported this to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and told his servant, ‘Go quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring back the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The servant said, ‘Sir, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the master told the servant, ‘Go out into the streets and the lanes and make the people come in, so that my house may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell all of you,none of those men who were invited will taste anything at my banquet.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now large crowds were traveling with Jesus. He turned and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, as well as his own life, he can't be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whoeverdoesn't carry his cross and follow me can't be my disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>“Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. He will first sit down and estimate the cost to see whether he has enough money to finish it, won't he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, if he lays a foundation and can't finish the building,everyone who watches will begin to ridicule him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and say, ‘This person started a building but couldn't finish it.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“Or suppose a king is going to war against another king. He will first sit down and consider whether with 10,000 men he can oppose the one coming against him with 20,000 men, won't he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If he can't, he will send a delegation to ask for terms of peace while the other kingis still far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the same way, none of you can be my disciple unless he gives up all his possessions.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>“Now, salt is good. But if the salt should lose its taste, how can its flavor be restored?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is suitable neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. Peoplethrow it away. Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
