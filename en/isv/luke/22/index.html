Follow him into the house he enters</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks you, “Where is the room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?”’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished. Get things ready for us there.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they went and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the hour came, he took his place at the table, along with the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them,“I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I tell you, I will never again eat one until it finds its fulfillment in the kingdom of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said,“Take this and share it among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I tell you, from now on I will never drink the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he took a loaf of bread, gave thanks, broke it in pieces, and handed it to them, saying,“This is my body, which is given for you. Keep on doing this in memory of me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He did the same with the cup after supper, saying,“This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet look! The hand of the man who is betraying me is with me on the table!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Son of Man is going away, just as it has been determined, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom he is betrayed!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then they began to discuss among themselves which one of them was going to do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now an argument sprang up among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he said to them,“The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you are not to do so. On the contrary, the greatest among you should become like the youngest, and the one who leads should become like the one who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For who is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? It is the one at the table, isn't it? But I am among you as one who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>“You are the ones who have always stood by me in my trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I confer on you, just as my Father has conferred on me, a kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit down on thrones to govern the twelve tribes of Israel.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has asked permission to sift all of youlike wheat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail. When you have turned back, you must strengthen your brothers.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go even to prison and to death with you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Jesus said,“I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he said to them,“When I sent you out without a wallet, traveling bag, or sandals, you didn't lack anything, did you?”They replied, “Nothing at all.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he said to them,“But now the one who has a wallet must take it along, and his traveling bag, too. And the one who has no sword must sell his coat and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I tell you, what has been written about me must be fulfilled: ‘He was counted among the criminals.’Indeed, what is written about me must be fulfilled.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So they said, “Lord, look! Here are two swords.”He answered them,“Enough of that!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he left and went to the Mount of Olives, as usual. The disciples went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When he came to the place, he said to them,“Keep on praying that you may not come into temptation.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and began to pray,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>“Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like large drops of blood falling on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When he got up from prayer, he went to the disciples and found them asleep from sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said to them,“Why are you sleeping? Get up and keep on praying that you may not come into temptation.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd came up. The man called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them, and he came close to Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said to him,“Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When those who were around him saw what was about to take place, they asked, “Lord, should we strike with our swords?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then one of them struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus said,“No more of this!” So he touched his ear and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to the high priests, the temple police, and the elders, who had come for him,“Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>While I was with you day after day in the temple, you didn't lay a hand on me. But this is your hour, when darkness reigns!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then they arrested him, led him away, and brought him to the high priest's house. But Peter was following at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had taken their seats, Peter, too, sat down among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>A servant girl saw him sitting by the fire, stared at him, and said, “This man was with him, too.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied it, saying, “I don't know him, woman!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>A little later a man looked at him and said, “You are one of them, too.”But Peter said, “Mister, I am not!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>About an hour later another man emphatically asserted, “This man was certainly with him, for he is a Galilean!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But Peter said, “Mister, I don't know what you're talking about!” Just then, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord and how he had said to him,“Before a rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he went outside and cried bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the men who were holding Jesus in custody began to make fun of him while they beat him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>They blindfolded him and asked him over and over again, “Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And they kept insulting him in many other ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>As soon as day came, the elders of the people, the high priests, and the scribes assembled and brought him before their Council.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>They said, “If you are the Christ, tell us.”But he said to them,“If I tell you, you won't believe me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if I ask you a question, you won't answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then they all asked, “Are you, then, the Son of God?”He answered them,“You say that I am.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Then they said, “Why do we need any more testimony? We have heard it ourselves from his own mouth!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
