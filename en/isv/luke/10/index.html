So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Get going! See, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Don't carry a wallet, a traveling bag, or sandals, and don't greet anyone on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>“Whatever house you go into, first say, ‘May there be peace in this house.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If a peaceful person lives there, your greeting of peace will remain with him. But if that's not the case, your greetingwill come back to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Stay with the same family, eating and drinking whatever they provide, for the worker deserves his pay. Don't move from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“Whenever you go into a town and the peoplewelcome you, eat whatever they serve you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>heal the sick that are there, and tell them, ‘The kingdom of God is near you!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But whenever you go into a town and peopledon't welcome you, go out into its streets and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>‘We are wiping off your town's dust that clings to our feet in protest against you! But realize this: the kingdom of God is near!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I tell you, on that day it will be easier for Sodom than for that town!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>“How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that happened in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It will be easier for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you! 15And you, Capernaum! You won't be lifted up to heaven, will you? You'll go down to Hades!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The person who listens to you listens to me, and the person who rejects you rejects me. The person who rejects me rejects the one who sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The seventy came back and joyously reported, “Lord, even the demons are submitting to us in your name!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to them,“I was watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look! I have given you the authority to trample snakes and scorpions and to destroyall the enemy's power, and nothing will ever hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However, stop rejoicing because the spirits are submitting to you. Rather, rejoice because your names are written in heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that hour Jesus was extremely joyful in the Holy Spirit and said,“I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent people and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for this is what was pleasing to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knowswho the Father is except the Son and the person to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then turning to the disciples in private, he said to them,“How blessed are the eyes that see what you see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I tell you, many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you see but didn't see them, and to hear the things you hear but didn't hear them.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Just then an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. He asked, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered him,“What is written in the law? What do you read there?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He answered, “You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind. And you must love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus told him,“You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the man wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>After careful consideration, Jesus replied,“A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of bandits. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By chance, a priest was traveling along that road. When he saw the man,he went by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Similarly, a Levite came to that place. When he saw the man,he also went by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But as he was traveling along, a Samaritan came across the man.When the Samaritansaw him, he was moved with compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The next day he took out two denariiand gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take good care of him. If you spend more than that, I'll repay you when I come back.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>“Of these three men, who do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the bandits?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said, “The one who showed mercy to him.”Jesus told him,“Go and do what he did.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now as they were traveling along, Jesus went into a village. A woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>She had a sister named Mary, who sat down at the Lord's feet and kept listening to what he was saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Martha was worrying about all the things she had to do, so she came to him and asked, “Lord, you do care that my sister has left me to do the work all by myself, don't you? Then tell her to help me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The Lord answered her,“Martha, Martha! You worry and fuss about a lot of things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But there's onlyone thing you need. Mary has chosen what is better,and it is not to be taken away from her.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
