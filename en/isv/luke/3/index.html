Make his paths straight!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Every valley will be filled,and every mountain and hill will be leveled.	The crooked ways will be made straight,and the rough roads will be made smooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Everyone will see the salvationthat God has provided.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>John would say to the crowds that were coming out to be baptized by him, “You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance! Don't begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our forefather.’ For I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The crowds kept asking him, “What, then, should we do?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them, “The person who has two coats must share with the one who doesn't have any, and the person who has food must do the same.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Even some tax collectors came to be baptized. They asked him, “Teacher, what should we do?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He told them, “Stop collecting more money than the amount you are told to collect.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even some soldiers were asking him, “And what should we do?”He told them, “Never extort money from anyone by threats or blackmail, and be satisfied with your pay.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the people were filled with expectation, and all of them were wondering if John was perhaps the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>John replied to all of them, “I am baptizing you with water, but the one who is stronger than I am is coming, and I am not worthy to untie his sandal straps. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor. He will gather the grain into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>With many other exhortations John continued to proclaim the good news to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Herod the tetrarch had been rebuked by John because he had married his brother's wife Herodias and because of all the evil things Herod had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Added to all this, Herod locked John up in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When all the people had been baptized, Jesus, too, was baptized. While he was praying, heaven opened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. Then a voice came from heaven, saying, “You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry. He was (so it was thought) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Matattha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
