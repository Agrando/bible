He leaves the ninety-nine in the wilderness and looks for the one that is lost until he finds it, doesn't he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When he finds it, he puts it on his shoulders and rejoices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he goes home, calls his friends and neighbors together, and says to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the same way, I tell you that there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“Or suppose a woman has ten coins and loses one of them.She lights a lamp, sweeps the house, and searches carefully until she finds it, doesn't she?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I lost!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the same way, I tell you that there is joy in the presence of God's angels over one sinner who repents.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jesus said,“A man had two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So the fatherdivided his property between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A few days later, the younger son gathered all he had and traveled to a distant country. There he wasted his possessions on wild living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After he had spent everything, a severe famine took place throughout that country, and he began to be in need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he went and hired himself out to one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He would gladly have filled himself with the husks the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>“Then he came to his senses and said, ‘How many of my father's hired men have more food than they can eat, and here I am starving to death!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will get up, go to my father, and say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heavenand you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I don't deserve to be called your son anymore. Treat me like one of your hired men.”’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>“So he got up and went to his father. While he was still far away, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son,threw his arms around him, and kissed him affectionately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then his son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heavenand you. I don't deserve to be called your son anymore.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his servants, ‘Hurry! Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let's eat and celebrate!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For my son was dead and has come back to life. He was lost and has been found.’ And they began to celebrate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“Now his older son was in the field. As he was coming back to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So he called to one of the servants and asked what was happening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The servanttold him, ‘Your brother has come home, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got him back safely.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>“Then the older sonbecame angry and wouldn't go into the house.So his father came out and began to plead with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he answered his father, “Listen! All these years I've worked like a slave for you. I've never disobeyed a command of yours. Yet you've never given me so much as a young goat so that I could celebrate with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But this son of yours spent your money on prostitutes, and when he came back, you killed the fattened calf for him!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“His fathersaid to him, ‘My child, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come back to life. He was lost and has been found.’”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
