But if you don't repent, then you, too, will all die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>What about those eighteen people who were killed when the tower at Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were worse offenders than all the other people living in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Absolutely not, I tell you! But if you don't repent, then you, too, will all die.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus told them this parable:“A man had a fig tree that had been planted in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on it but didn't find any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So he said to the gardener, ‘Look here! For three years I have been coming to look for fruit on this tree but haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it waste the soil?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the gardenerreplied, ‘Sir, leave it alone for one more year, until I dig around it and fertilize it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Maybe next year it'll bear fruit. If not, then cut it down.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A woman was there who had a spirit that had disabled her for eighteen years. She was hunched over and completely unable to stand up straight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Jesus saw her, he called to her and said,“Woman, you are free from your illness.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he placed his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight and began praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the synagogue leader, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, told the crowd, “There are six days when work is to be done. So come on those days to be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord replied to him,“You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey and lead it out of the stall to give it some water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shouldn't this woman, a descendant of Abraham whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free from this bondage on the Sabbath day?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even as he was saying this, all of his opponents were blushing with shame. But the entire crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things he was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Jesus went on to say,“What is the kingdom of God like? What can I compare it to?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is like a mustard seed that someone took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds in the sky nest in its branches.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again he said,“What can I compare the kingdom of God to?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed withthree measures of flour until all of it was leavened.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Jesus taught in one town and village after another as he made his way to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?”He said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“Keep on struggling to enter through the narrow door. For I tell you that many people will try to enter but won't be able to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>After the homeowner gets up and closes the door, you can standoutside, knock on the door, and say again and again, ‘Lord, open the door for us!’ But he will answer you, ‘I don't know where you come from.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thenyou will say,‘We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he will tell you, ‘I don't know where you come from. Get away from me, all you evildoers!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In that place there will be crying and gnashing of teethwhen you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves being driven away on the outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>People will come from east and west, and from north and south, and will eat in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>You see, some who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At that hour some Pharisees came and told Jesus, “Leave and get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He said to them,“Go and tell that fox, ‘Listen! I am driving out demons and healing today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will finish my work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>ButI must be on my way today, tomorrow, and the next day, for it's not possible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones to death those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you didn't want to!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Look! Your house is left to you deserted. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, ‘How blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!’”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
