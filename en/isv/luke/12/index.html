Jesus began to speak first to his disciples.“Watch out for the yeast—that is, the hypocrisy—of the Pharisees!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There is nothing covered that will not be exposed and nothing secret that will not be made known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Accordingly, what you have said in darkness will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whisperedin private rooms will be shouted from the housetops.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>“But I tell you, my friends, never be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can't do anything more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I'll show you the one you should be afraid of. Be afraid of the one who has the authority to throw you into hellafter killing you. Yes, I tell you, be afraid of him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>“Five sparrows are sold for two pennies, aren't they? Yet not one of them is forgotten in God's sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Why, even all the hairs on your head have been counted! Stop being afraid. You are worth more than a bunch of sparrows.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“But I tell you, the Son of Man will acknowledge before God's angels everyone who acknowledges me before people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But whoever denies me before people will be denied before God's angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the person who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When peoplebring you before synagogue leaders,rulers, or authorities, don't worry about howyou will defend yourselves or what you will say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For in that hour the Holy Spirit will teach you what you are to say.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said to him,“Mister,who appointed me to be a judge or arbitrator over you people?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said to them,“Be careful to guard yourselves against every kind of greed, for a person's life doesn't consist of the amount of possessions he has.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he told them a parable. He said,“The land of a certain rich man produced good crops.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he began to think to himself, ‘What should I do, since I have no place to store my crops?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thenhe said, ‘This is what I'll do. I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and I'll store all my grain and goods in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I'll say to my soul, “Soul, you've stored up plenty of good things for many years. Take it easy, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself.”’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>ButGod said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Now who will get the things you've accumulated?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That's how it is with the person who stores up treasures for himself and isn't rich toward God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples,“That's why I'm telling you to stop worrying about your life—what you will eat—or about your body—what you will wear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the crows.They don't plant or harvest, they don't even have a storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Can any of you add an hour to your span of lifeby worrying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So if you can't do a small thing like that, why worry about other things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider how the lilies grow. They don't work or spin yarn, but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now if that's the way God clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and thrown into an oven tomorrow, how much more will he clothe you—you who have little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>“So stop concerning yourselves about what you will eat or what you will drink, and stop being distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For it is the Gentiles who are concerned about all these things. Surely your Father knows that you need them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Instead, be concerned about hiskingdom, and these things will be provided for you as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Stop being afraid, little flock, for your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>“Sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor. Make yourselves wallets that don't wear out—a dependable treasure in heaven, where no thief can get close and no moth can destroy anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>“You must keep your belts fastened and your lamps burning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be like people who are waiting for their master to return from a wedding. As soon as he comes and knocks, they will open the door for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>How blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching for him when he comes! Truly I tell you, he will put an apron on, make them sit down at the table, and go around and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>How blessed they will be if he comes in the middle of the night or near dawnand finds them awake!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But be sure of this: if the homeowner had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would have watched andwould not have let his house be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour when you don't expect him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Peter asked, “Lord, are you telling this parable just for us or for everyone?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The Lord said,“Who, then, is the faithful and careful manager whom his master will put in charge of giving all his other servants their share of food at the right time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing this when he comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>TrulyI tell you, he will put him in charge of all his property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>“But if that servant says to himself,‘My master is taking a long time to come back,’ and begins to beat the other servants and to eat, drink, and get drunk,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the master of that servant will come on a day when he doesn't expect him and at an hour that he doesn't know. Then his masterwill punish him severelyand assign him a place with unfaithful people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>That servant who knew what his master wanted but didn't prepare himself or do what was wanted will receive a severe beating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But the servantwho did things that deserved a beating without knowing it will receive a light beating. Much will be required from everyone to whom much has been given. But even more will be demanded from the one to whom much has been entrusted.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>“I have come to bring fire on earth, and how I wish it were already kindled!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>I have a baptism to be baptized with, and what stress I am under until it is completed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>“Do you think that I came to bring peace on earth? Not at all, I tell you, but rather division!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>From now on, five people in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They will be divided father against son, son against father, mother against daughter, daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then Jesus said to the crowds,“When you see a cloud coming in the west, you immediately say, ‘There's going to be a storm,’ and that's what happens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When you see a south wind blowing, you say, ‘It's going to be hot,’ and so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, yet you don't know how to interpret the present time?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>“Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For example, when you go with your opponent in front of a ruler, do your best to settle with him on the way there. Otherwise, you will be dragged in front of the judge, and the judge will hand you over to an officer, and the officer will throw you into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell you, you will never get out of there until you pay back the last penny!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
