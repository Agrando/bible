His wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, and they lived blamelessly according to all of the commandments and regulations of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They had no children because Elizabeth was barren and because both of them were getting on in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Zechariah was serving with his division of priests in God's presence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>he was chosen by lot to go into the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense, according to the custom of the priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the entire congregation of people was praying outside at the time when the incense was burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the incense altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Zechariah saw him, he was shaken, and fear overwhelmed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the angel said to him, “Stop being afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You will have joy and gladness, and many people will rejoice at his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He will never drink wine or any strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will bring many of Israel's descendants back to the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He is the one who will go before the Lord with the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and to prepare the people to be ready for the Lord.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know this is so? For I am an old man, and my wife is getting on in years.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. I have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at the proper time, you will become silent and unable to speak until the day this happens.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Meanwhile, the people kept waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed in the sanctuary so long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them but remained unable to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When the days of his service were over, he went home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and remained in seclusion for five months. She said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“This is what the Lord did for me when he looked favorably on me and took away my public disgrace.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now in the sixth month of her pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The angel came to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>She was startled by his statement and tried to figure out what his greeting meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the angel told her, “Stop being afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Listen! You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his forefather David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Mary asked the angel, “How can this be, since I have not had relations with a man?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the power of the Most High will cover you. Therefore, the child will be holy and will be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And listen! Elizabeth, your relative, has herself conceived a son in her old age. This is the sixth month for the woman who was said to be barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For nothing is impossible for God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Mary said, “Truly I am the Lord's servant. Let everything you have said happen to me.” Then the angel left her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>At this time Mary set out hurriedly for a Judean city in the hill country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>She went into Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby jumped in her womb. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and exclaimed with a loud cry, “How blessed are you among women, and how blessed is the fruit of your womb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why should this happen to me, to have the mother of my Lord visit me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>How blessed is this woman for believing that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Mary said,	“My soul praises the greatness of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>My spirit exults in God, my Savior,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>for he has looked favorably on his humble servant.	From now on, all generations will call me blessed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>because the Almighty has done great things for me.His name is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>His mercy lasts from generation to generationfor those who fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He displayed his mighty power with his arm.	He scattered people who were proud in mind and heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He pulled powerful rulers from their thronesand lifted up humble people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He filled hungry people with good thingsand sent rich people away with nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He helped his servant Israel,remembering to be merciful,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>according to the promise he made to our ancestors—to Abraham and his descendants forever.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Now Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>On the eighth day they went to circumcise the child. They were going to name him Zechariah after his father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>but his mother said, “Absolutely not! He must be named John.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Their friends said to her, “None of your relatives has that name.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>So they motioned to the baby's father to see what he wanted to name him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And everyone was amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Suddenly, Zechariah's mouth was opened, his tongue was set free, and he began to speak and to praise God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Fear came over all their neighbors, and throughout the hill country of Judea all these things were being discussed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>All who heard about it debated in their minds what had happened and said, “What will this child become?” For it was obvious that the hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>“Blessed be the Lord God of Israel!He has taken care of his people and has set them free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>He has raised up a mighty Savior for usfrom the family of his servant David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>just as he promised long ago		through the mouth of his holy prophets</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>that he would save us from our enemiesand from the grip of all who hate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>He has shown mercy to our ancestorsand remembered his holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham.	He granted us</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>deliverance from our enemies' gripso that we could serve him without fear</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>and be holy and righteous before him all of our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High.	For you will go ahead of the Lord to prepare his ways</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>and to give his people the knowledge of salvationthrough the forgiveness of their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Because of the tender mercy of our God,the dawn from on high has broken upon us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>to shine on those who sit in darkness and in death's shadow,and to guide our feet into the way of peace.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>Now the child continued to grow and to become strong in spirit. He lived in the wilderness until the day he appeared in Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
