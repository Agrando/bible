Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>‘the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then they remembered his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven and all the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The women who told the apostles about it were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But these words seemed nonsense to them, and they wouldn't believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. He stooped down and saw only the linen cloths. Then he went home wondering about what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On the same day, two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They were talking with each other about all these things that had taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself approached and began to walk with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He asked them,“What are you discussing with each other as you're walking along?” They stood still and looked gloomy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The one whose name was Cleopas answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn't know what happened there these days?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He asked them,“What things?”They answered him, “The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in the things that he did and said before God and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and had him crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we kept hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel. What is more, this is now the third day since these things occurred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Even some of our women have startled us! They were at the tomb early this morning</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and didn't find his body there, so they came back and told us that they had actually seen a vision of angels who said he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn't see him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jesus said to them,“O how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe everything the prophets said!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The Christhad to suffer these things and then enter his glory, didn't he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them all the passages of Scripture about himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As they came near the village where they were going, he acted as though he were going on farther.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is almost evening and the day is almost gone.” So he went in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>While he was at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it in pieces, and gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then their eyes were opened, and they knew who he was. And he vanished from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then they said to each other, “Our hearts kept burning within us as he was talking to us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us, didn't they?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>That same hour they got up and went back to Jerusalem and found the eleven and their companions all together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They kept saying, “The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they themselves began to tell what had happened on the road and how he was recognized by them when he broke the bread in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While they were talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them,“Peace be with you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were startled and terrified, thinking they were seeing a ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said to them,“Why are you frightened, and why are doubts arising in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Look at my hands and my feet, for it is I myself. Touch me and see, for a ghost doesn't have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>After he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While they still could not believe it for joy and were full of amazement, he said to them,“Do you have anything here to eat?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he took it and ate it in their presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he said to them,“These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you—that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms had to be fulfilled.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their minds so that they might come to understand the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said to them,“Thus it is written, that the Christwas to suffer and to rise from the dead on the third day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I am sending on you what my Father promised. But stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then he led them out as far as Bethany, lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>While he was blessing them, he parted from them and was taken up to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they were continually in the temple blessing God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
