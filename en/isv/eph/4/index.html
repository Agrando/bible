In the same way, you were called to the one hope of your calling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>one God and Father of all, who is above all, through all, and in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now to each one of us grace has been given according to the measure of Christ's gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is why God says,	“When he went up to the highest placehe led captives into captivityand gave gifts to people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now what does this “he went up” mean except that he also had gone down into the lower parts of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The one who went down is the same one who went up above all the heavens so that he might fill everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it is he who gifted some to be apostles, others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, and still others to be pastors and teachers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>to perfect the saints, to do the work of ministry, and to build up the body of Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>until all of us are united in the faith and in the full knowledge of God's Son, and until we attain mature adulthood and the full standard of development in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then we will no longer be little children, tossed like waves and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people's trickery, or by clever strategies that would lead us astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead, by speaking the truth in love, we will grow up completely into the one who is the head, that is, into Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in whom the whole body is united and held together by every ligament with which it is supplied. As each individual part does its job, the body's growth is promoted so that it builds itself up in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, I tell you and insist on in the Lord not to live any longer like the Gentiles live, thinking worthless thoughts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Since they have lost all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to sensuality and practice every kind of sexual perversion without restraint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>However, that is not the way you came to know Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Surely you have listened to him and have been taught by him, since truth is in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Regarding your former way of life, you were taught to strip off your old man, which is being ruined by its deceptive desires,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to clothe yourselves with the new man, which was created according to the likeness of God in righteousness and true holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, stripping off falsehood, “let each of us speak the truth to his neighbor,” for we are members of one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“Be angry, yet do not sin.” Do not let the sun go down on your wrath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and do not give the devil an opportunity to work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The thief must no longer steal but must work hard and do what is good with his own hands, so that he might have something to give to the needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let no filthy talk come out of your mouths, but only what is good for building up as the need may be. This way you will give grace to those who hear you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do not grieve the Holy Spirit, by whom you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, quarreling, and slander be put away from you, along with all hatred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another just as God has forgiven you in Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
