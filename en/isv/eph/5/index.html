Instead, let there be thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you know very well that no immoral or impure person, or anyone who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not let anyone deceive you with meaningless words, for it is because of these things that God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So do not be partners with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the fruit of the light consists of every form of goodness, righteousness, and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Determine what pleases the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and have nothing to do with the unfruitful works of darkness. Instead, expose them for what they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is shameful even to mention what is done by people in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But everything that is exposed to the light becomes visible,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for everything that is visible is light. That is why it says,	“Wake up, O sleeper!Arise from the dead,And Christ will shine on you.’’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So, then, be careful how you live. Do not be unwise but wise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>making the best use of time because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Stop getting drunk with wine, which leads to wild living, but keep on being filled with the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then you will recite to one another psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. You will sing and make music to the Lord with your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You will always give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you will submit yourselves to one another out of reverence for Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. It is he who is the Savior of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Indeed, just as the church is submissive to Christ, so wives must be submissive to their husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that he might make it holy by cleansing it, washing it with water and the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and might present the church to himself in all its glory, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind, but holy and without fault.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In the same way, husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no one has ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, as Christ does the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we are parts of his body—of his flesh and of his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This is a great secret, but I am talking about Christ and the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But each individual man among you must love his wife as he loves himself; and may the wife fear her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
