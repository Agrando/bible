By nature we deserved wrath, just like everyone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love for us</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>even when we were dead because of our offenses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly realm in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so that in the coming ages he might display the limitless riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For by such grace you have been saved through faith. This does not come from you; it is the gift of God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and not the result of works, lest anyone boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For we are his masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared long ago to be our way of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So then, remember that at one time you were Gentiles by birth and were called “the uncircumcision” by what is called “the circumcision” made in the flesh by hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At that time you were without Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise. You had no hope and were in the world without God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But now, in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is he who is our peace. In his flesh he made both groups one by tearing down the wall of hostility that divided them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He rendered the law inoperative, along with its commandments and regulations, so that he might create in himself one new humanity from the two, thus making peace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, on which he killed the hostility.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He came and proclaimed peace for you who were far away and for you who were near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For through him, both of us have access to the Father in one Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>That is why you are no longer strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In him the whole building is joined together and rises into a holy sanctuary in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You, too, are being built in him along with the others into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
