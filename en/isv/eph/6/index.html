Do not threaten them, for you know that both of you have the same Master in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Put on the whole armor of God so that you may be able to stand firm against the devil's strategies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For our struggle is not against a human opponent, but against rulers, against authorities, against cosmic powers in the darkness around us, against evil spiritual forces in the heavenly realm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this reason, take up the whole armor of God so that you may be able to take a stand in that evil day. And when you have done everything you could, you will be able to stand firm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Stand firm, therefore, having fastened the belt of truth around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and having put shoes on your feet so that you are ready to proclaim the gospel of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In addition to all of these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>also take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray in the Spirit at all times with every kind of prayer and request there is. For the same reason be alert with every kind of effort and request for all the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Pray also for me, so that, when I open my mouth, the right words will be given to me. Then I will boldly make known the secret of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for whose sake I am an ambassador in chains, desiring to declare it as boldly as I should.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So that you may know what has happened to me and how I am doing, Tychicus, our dear brother and a faithful minister in the Lord, will tell you everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I am sending him to you for this very reason, so that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>May the brothers have peace and love, with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>May grace be with all who love the Lord Jesus Christ with sincerity!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
