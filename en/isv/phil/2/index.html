In human form he chose to be,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And lived in all humility,Death on a cross obeying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now lifted up by God to heaven,A name above all others given,This matchless name possessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And so, when Jesus’ name is called,The knees of everyone should fallWhere'er they are residing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then every tongue in one accord,Will say that Jesus Christ is Lord,While God the Father praising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And so, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only when I was with you but even more now that I am absent, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it is God who is producing in you both the desire and the ability to do what pleases him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do everything without complaining or arguing</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that you may be blameless and innocent, God's children without any faults among a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like stars in the world</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as you hold out the word of life. Then I can boast in the day of Christ that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet even if I am being poured out like an offering as part of the sacrifice and service I offer for your faith, I rejoice, and I share my joy with all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the same way, you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I can be encouraged when I learn of your condition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I do not have anyone else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For all the others look after their own interests, not after those of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you know his proven worth—how like a son with his father he served with me in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things are going to turn out for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Indeed, I am confident in the Lord that I will come to visit you soon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Meanwhile, I thought it best to send Epaphroditus—my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need—back to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he has been longing for all of you and is troubled because you heard that he was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Indeed, he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow on top of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, I am especially eager to send him so that you may have the joy of seeing him again, and so that I may feel relieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So welcome him in the Lord with all joy, and make sure you honor such people highly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
