Both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, all of you are partners with me in grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For God is my witness how much I long for all of you with the compassion of Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And this is my prayer, that your love will keep on growing more and more in full knowledge and perfect insight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>so that you may be able to determine what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>having been filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually turned out for the progress of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As a result, it has become clear to the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that I am in prison because of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover, because of my imprisonment most of the brothers have been made confident in the Lord to speak God's word more boldly and courageously than ever before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Some are preaching Christ because of their envy and rivalry, while others do so because of their good will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The latter are motivated by love, because they know that I have been appointed for the defense of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition and without sincerity, thinking that they will stir up trouble for me during my imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But what does it matter? Just this, that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and because of this I rejoice. Yes, I will continue to rejoice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This is according to my eager expectation and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of. Instead, because of my boldness Christ will be exalted in my body, now as always, whether I live or die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me, to go on living is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now if I go on living in this body, that will produce more results, yet I do not know which I would prefer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Indeed, I cannot decide between the two. I have the desire to leave this life and be with Christ, for that is far better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But for your sake it is better that I remain in this body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will continue to live and be with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then your boasting in Christ Jesus will increase along with mine through my coming again to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The only thing that matters is that you continue to live as good citizens in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come to see you or whether I stay away, I may hear all about you—that you are standing firm in one spirit, struggling with one mind for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and that you are not intimidated by your opponents in any way. This is evidence that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved—and all because of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For you have been given the privilege for Christ's sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>You have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear that I am still having.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
