It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you; indeed, it is for your safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beware of the dogs! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the mutilators!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For it is we who are the circumcision—we who worship in the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus. We have not placed any confidence in the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>although I could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he can place confidence in the flesh, I have more reason to think so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Having been circumcised on the eighth day, I am of the nation of Israel, from the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. As far as the law is concerned, I was a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As far as zeal is concerned, I was a persecutor of the church. As far as the righteousness that is in the law is concerned, I was perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But whatever things were assets to me, these I now consider a loss for the sake of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>What is more, I continue to consider all these things as a loss for the sake of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It is because of him that I have experienced the loss of all those things. Indeed, I consider them rubbish in order to gain Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through the faithfulness of Christ, the righteousness that comes from God and that depends on faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I want to know Christ—what his resurrection power is like and what it means to share in his sufferings by becoming like him in his death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>though I hope to experience the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It's not that I have already reached this goal or have already become perfect. But I keep pursuing it, hoping somehow to embrace it just as I have been embraced by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Brothers, I do not consider myself to have embraced it. But this one thing I do: Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I keep pursuing the goal to win the prize of God's heavenly call in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, those of us who are mature should think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will show you how to think.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>However, we should live up to what we have achieved so far.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Join together in imitating me, brothers, and pay close attention to those who live by the example we have given you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, that many live as enemies of the cross of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Their destiny is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on worldly things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our citizenship, however, is in heaven, and it is from there that we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorious body through the power that enables him to bring everything under his authority.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
