They have struggled with me in the gospel along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Keep on rejoicing in the Lord at all times. I will say it again: Keep on rejoicing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Let your forbearing spirit be known to all people.The Lord is near:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Never worry about anything, but in every situation let your petitions be made known to God in prayers and requests, with thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then God's peace, which goes far beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is fair, whatever is pure, whatever is acceptable, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy—keep thinking about these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Likewise, keep practicing these things: what you have learned, received, heard, and seen in me. Then the God of peace will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now I rejoice in the Lord greatly, because once again you have shown your concern for me. Of course, you were concerned for me but you did not have an opportunity to show it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am not saying this because I am in any need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I am in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know how to be humble, and I know how to prosper. In each and every situation I have learned the secret of being full and of going hungry, of having too much and of having too little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I can do all things through him who strengthens me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless, it was kind of you to share my troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You Philippians also know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church participated with me in the matter of giving and receiving except for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Even while I was in Thessalonica, you provided for my needs not once, but twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is not that I am looking for a gift. No, I am looking for the profit that accumulates to your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have been paid in full and have more than enough. I am fully supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus what you sent—a fragrant aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And my God will fully supply your every need according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Glory belongs to our God and Father forever and ever! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send their greetings to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All the saints, especially those of the emperor's household, greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
