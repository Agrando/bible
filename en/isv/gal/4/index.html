While we were children, we were slaves to the basic principles of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>in order to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as his children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now because you are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts to cry out, “Abba! Father!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if you are a child, then you are also an heir through God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>However, in the past, when you did not know God, you were slaves to things that are not really gods at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But now that you know God, or rather have been known by God, how can you turn back again to those powerless and bankrupt basic principles? Why do you want to become their slaves all over again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You are observing days, months, seasons, and years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am afraid for you, lest somehow my work for you has been wasted!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I beg you, brothers, to become like me, since I became like you. You did not do anything wrong to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You know that it was because I was ill that I brought you the gospel the first time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even though my condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me. On the contrary, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What, then, happened to your positive attitude? For I testify that if it had been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So have I now become your enemy for telling you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These people are devoted to you, but not in a good way. They want you to avoid me so that you will be devoted to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now it is always good to be devoted to a good cause, even when I am not with you.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My children, I am suffering birth pains for you again until Christ is formed in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Indeed, I wish I were with you right now so that I could change the tone of my voice, because I am completely baffled by you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, those of you who want to live under the law: Are you really listening to what the law says?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the son of the slave woman was conceived according to the flesh, but the son of the free woman was conceived through a promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is being said as an allegory, for these women represent two covenants. The one woman, Hagar, is from Mount Sinai, and her children are born into slavery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to present-day Jerusalem, because she is in slavery along with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the heavenly Jerusalem is the free woman, and she is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written,	“Rejoice, you childless woman,who cannot give birth to any children!	Break into song and shout,you who feel no pains of childbirth!	For the children of the deserted womanare more numerous than the childrenof the woman who has a husband.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So you, brothers, are children of the promise, like Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But just as then the son who was conceived according to the flesh persecuted the son who was conceived according to the Spirit, so it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what does the Scripture say? “Drive out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman must never share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
