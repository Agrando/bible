Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ to follow a different gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>which is not really another one. To be sure, there are certain people who are troubling you and want to distort the gospel about Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let that person be condemned!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What we have told you in the past I am now telling you again: If anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let that person be condemned!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Am I now trying to win the approval of people or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be Christ's servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I did not receive it from a man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard about my earlier life in Judaism—how I kept violently persecuting God's church and was trying to destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries, because I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when God, who set me apart before I was born and who called me by his grace, was pleased</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son to me so that I might proclaim him among the Gentiles, I did not confer with another human being at any time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me. Instead, I went away to Arabia and then came back to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I did not see any other apostle except James, the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(I declare before God that what I am writing to you is not a lie.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I was unknown by sight to the churches of Christ in Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The only thing they kept hearing was this: “The man who used to persecute us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they kept glorifying God for what had happened to me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
