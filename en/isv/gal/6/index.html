Watch out for yourself so that you are not tempted as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Practice carrying each other's burdens. In this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For if anyone thinks he is something when he is really nothing, he is only fooling himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Each person must approve his own actions, and then he can boast about his own accomplishments and not those of his neighbor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For everyone must carry his own load.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The person who is taught the word should share all his goods with his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Stop being deceived; God is not to be ridiculed. A person harvests whatever he plants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the person who plants in his flesh will harvest decay from the flesh, but the person who plants in the Spirit will harvest eternal life from the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let us not get tired of doing what is good, for at the right time we will reap a harvestâ€”if we do not give up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So then, whenever we have the opportunity, let us practice doing good to everyone, especially to the family of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Look at how large these letters are because I am writing with my own hand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>These people who want to impress others by their flesh are trying to force you to be circumcised, simply to avoid being persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Why, not even those who are circumcised obey the law! They simply want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. Rather, what matters is being a new creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now may peace be on all those who live by this principle, and may mercy be on the Israel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From now on let no one make trouble for me, for I carry the scars of Jesus on my own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
