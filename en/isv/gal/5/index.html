So keep on standing firm in it, and stop attaching yourselves to the yoke of slavery again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, Christ will be of no benefit to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Again, I insist that everyone who allows himself to be circumcised is obligated to obey the entire law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those of you who are trying to be justified by the law have been cut off from Christ. You have fallen away from grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For through the Spirit, by faith, we eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. What matters is faith that is active through love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You were running beautifully! Who cut in on you and stopped you from obeying the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Such influence does not come from the one who calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little yeast spreads through the whole batch of dough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view of the matter. However, the one who is troubling you will suffer God's judgment, whoever he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching the necessity of circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I wish that those who are unsettling you would castrate themselves!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you, brothers, were called to freedom. Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity to gratify your flesh, but through love make it your habit to serve one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the whole law is summarized in a single statement: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you are not destroyed by each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will never fulfill the desires of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For what the flesh wants is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit wants is opposed to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, and so you do not do what you want to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are being led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity, promiscuity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, rivalry, jealously, outbursts of anger, quarrels, conflicts, factions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envy, murder, drunkenness, wild partying, and things like that. I am telling you now, as I have told you in the past, that people who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their flesh with its passions and desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us stop being arrogant, provoking one another and envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
