I did this because I was afraid that I was running or had run for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But not even Titus, who was with me, was forced to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>However, false brothers were secretly brought in. They slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus so that they might enslave us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But we did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now those who were reputed to be important added nothing to my message. (What sort of people they were makes no difference to me, since God pays no attention to outward appearances.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In fact, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the one who worked through Peter by making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me by sending me to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So when James, Cephas, and John (who were reputed to be leaders) recognized the grace that had been given me, they gave Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The only thing they asked us to do was to remember the destitute, the very thing I was eager to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For until some men came from James, he was in the habit of eating with the Gentiles, but after they came he drew back and would not associate himself with them, being afraid of the circumcision party.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The other Jews also joined him in this hypocrisy, to the extent that even Barnabas was caught up in their hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when I saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel, I told Cephas in front of everyone, “Though you are a Jew, you live like a Gentile and not like a Jew. So how can you insist that the Gentiles must live like Jews?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We ourselves are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>yet we know that a person is not justified by the works of the law but by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. We, too, have believed in Christ Jesus so that we might be justified by the faith of Christ and not by the works of the law, for no human being will be justified by the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now if we, while trying to be justified in Christ, have been found to be sinners, does that mean that Christ is a minister of sin? Of course not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if I rebuild something that I tore down, I demonstrate that I am a wrongdoer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, and the life that I now live in the flesh I live by the faithfulness of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
