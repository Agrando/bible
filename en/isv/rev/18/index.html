He had great authority, and the earth was made bright by his splendor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He cried out in a powerful voice,	“Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen!She has become a home for demons.	She is a prison for every unclean spirit,a prison for every unclean bird,and a prison for every uncleanand hated beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For all the nations have drunkfrom the wine of her sexual immorality,	and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her.	The merchants of the earth have become richfrom the power of her luxury.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then I heard another voice from heaven saying,	“Come out of her, my people,so that you don't participate in her sinsand suffer from her plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For her sins are piled as high as heaven,and God has remembered her crimes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do to her as she herself has done.Give her double for her deeds.	Mix a double drink for her in the cup she mixed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Just as she glorified herself and lived in luxury,so give her just as much torture and misery.	In her heart she says,‘I am a queen on a throne, not a widow.I will never see misery.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this reason her plagues of death, misery, and famine will come in a single day.	She will be burned up in a fire,because powerful is the Lord God who judges her.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality with her and lived in luxury with her, will cry and mourn over her when they see the smoke rising from her fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Frightened by her torture, they will stand far away and say,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for that great city,the powerful city Babylon!For in one hour your judgment has come!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The merchants of the earth cry and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo anymore—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>cargo of gold, silver, gems, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all articles made of ivory, all articles made of very costly wood, bronze, iron, marble,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and slaves (that is, human souls).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>“The fruit for which your soul craved has left you.All your dainties and your splendor are lost to you. No one will ever find them again.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Frightened by her torture, the merchants of these wares who had become rich from her will stand far away. They will cry and mourn,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for the great citythat was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarletand was adorned with gold, gems, and pearls!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in one hour all this wealth has been destroyed!”Every ship's captain, everyone who traveled by ship, sailors, and everyone who made a living by the sea stood far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they saw the smoke from her fire, they began to cry out, “What city was like the great city?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they threw dust on their heads and shouted while crying and mourning,	“How terrible, how terrible it is for the great city,where all who had ships at sea became richbecause of her wealth!		For in one hour she has been destroyed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Gloat over her, heaven, saints, apostles, and prophets!For God has condemned her for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then a powerful angel picked up a stone that was like a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,	“The great city Babylon will be thrown down with violent force—and will never be found again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeterswill never be heard in you again.	No artisan of any tradewill ever be found in you again.	The sound of a millstonewill never be heard in you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The light from a lamp will never shine in you again.	The voice of a bridegroom and bridewill never be heard in you again.	For your merchants were the important people of the world,and all the nations were deceived by your witchcraft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The blood of prophets, saints, and all who had been murderedon earth was found in her.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
