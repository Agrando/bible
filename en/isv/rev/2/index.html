I also know that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who call themselves apostles, but are not, and have found them to be false.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You have endured and suffered because of my name, yet you have not grown weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>However, I have this against you: You have abandoned the love you had at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, remember how far you have fallen. Repent, and do the works you did at first. If you don't, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this is to your credit: You hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To everyone who conquers I will give the privilege of eating from the tree of life that is in the paradise of God.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“To the messengerof the church in Smyrna, write:‘The first and the last, who was dead and became alive, says this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>‘I know your suffering, your poverty—though you are rich—and the slander on the part of those who claim to be Jews but aren't. They are the synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Don't be afraid of what you are going to suffer. Look! The devil is going to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested. For ten days you will undergo suffering. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the victor's crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will never be hurt by the second death.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“To the messengerof the church in Pergamum, write:‘The one who holds the sharp, two-edged sword, says this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>‘I know where you live. Satan's throne is there. Yet you hold on to my name and have not denied your faith in me,even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was killed in your presence, where Satan lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you: You have there some who hold to the teaching of Balaam, the one who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So repent. If you don't, I will come to you quickly and wage war against them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone. On the white stone is written a new name that no one knows except the person who receives it.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“To the messengerof the church in Thyatira, write:‘The Son of God, whose eyes are like flaming fire and whose feet are like glowing bronze, says this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>‘I know your works—your love, faithfulness,service, and endurance—and that your last works are greater than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet and who teaches and leads my servants to practice immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Igave her time to repent, but she refused to repent of her immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Look! I am going to throw her into a sickbed. Those who commit adultery with her will also have great suffering, unless they repent of her works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts. I will reward each of you as your works deserve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>‘But as for the rest of you in Thyatira—you who do not hold on to this teaching and who have not learned what some people call the deep things of Satan—I won't lay on you any other burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Just hold on to what you have until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To the person who conquers and continues to do my works to the end I will give authority over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He will rule them with an iron scepter, as when clay pots are shattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Just as I have received authority from my Father, I will also give him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>‘Let the person who has an ear listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.’</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
