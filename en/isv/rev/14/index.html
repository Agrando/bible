With him were 144,000 people who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They were singing a new song in front of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins, and they follow the lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from among humanity as the first fruits for God and the lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In their mouth no lie was found. They are blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I saw another angel flying overhead with the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then another angel, a second one, followed him, saying, “Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! She has made all the nations drink the wine of the wrath of her sexual sins.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying in a loud voice, “Whoever worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or his hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>will drink the wine of God's wrath, which has been poured unmixed into the cup of his anger. He will be tortured with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The smoke from their torture goes up forever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image or for anyone who receives the mark of its name.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and hold on to the faithfulness of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: How blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on!”“Yes,” says the Spirit. “Let them rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I looked, and there was a white cloud! On the cloud sat someone who was like the Son of Man, with a gold victor's crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Another angel came out of the temple, crying out in a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud, “Swing your sickle, and gather the harvest, for the hour has come to gather it, because the harvest on the earth is fully ripe.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He, too, had a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>From the altar came another angel who had authority over fire. He called out in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle, “Swing your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches of grapes from the vine of the earth, because those grapes are ripe.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the angel swung his sickle on the earth and gathered the grapes from the earth and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The wine press was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed out of the wine press as high as a horse's bridle for 200 miles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
