He was dressed in a cloud, and there was a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his legs were like columns of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He held a small, opened scroll in his hand. Setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>he shouted in a loud voice as a lion roars. When he shouted, the seven thunders spoke with voices of their own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the seven thunders spoke, I was going to write, but I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and don't write it down.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He swore an oath by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it: “There will be no more delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet, the secret of God will be fulfilled, as he had announced to his servants, the prophets.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go and take the opened scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the small scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it. It will be bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I took the small scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the seven thunders told me, “Again you must prophesy about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
