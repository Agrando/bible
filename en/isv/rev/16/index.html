A horrible, painful sore appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The second angel poured his bowl into the sea. It became like the blood of a dead body, and every living thing in the sea died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I heard the angel of the water say,	“You are just. You are the one who isand who was, the Holy One,because you have judged these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have given them blood to drinkbecause they have poured out the blood of saints and prophets.This is what they deserve.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I heard the altar reply,	“Yes, Lord God Almighty,your judgments are true and just.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun. It was allowed to burn people with fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and they were burned by the fierce heat. They cursed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. Its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed on their tongues in anguish</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and sores. But they did not repent of their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great Euphrates River. Its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw three disgusting spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They are demonic spirits that perform signs. They go to the kings of the whole earth and gather them for the war of the great day of God Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“See, I am coming like a thief. How blessed is the person who remains alert and keeps his clothes on! He won't have to go naked and let others see his shame.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The spirits gathered the kings at the place that is called Armageddon in Hebrew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The seventh angel poured his bowl into the air. A loud voice came from the throne in the temple and said, “It has happened!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, and a powerful earthquake. There has never been such a powerful earthquake since people have been on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered to give Babylon the Great the cup of wine filled with the fury of his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Every island vanished, and the mountains could no longer be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Huge hailstones, each weighing about 100 pounds, fell from the sky on people. They cursed God because the plague of hail was such a terrible plague.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
