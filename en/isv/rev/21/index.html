He will make his home with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them, and he will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There won't be death anymore. There won't be any grief, crying, or pain, because the first things have disappeared.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The one sitting on the throne said,“See, I am making all things new!” He said,“Write this: ‘These words are trustworthy and true.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he said to me,“It has happened! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give a drink from the spring of the water of life to the one who is thirsty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The person who conquers will inherit these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But people who are cowardly, unfaithful, detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars will find themselves in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. This is the second death.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came to me and said, “Come! I will show you the bride, the wife of the lamb.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He carried me away in the Spirit to a large, high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It had the glory of God, and its light was like a valuable gem, like jasper, as clear as crystal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It had a large, high wall with twelve gates. Twelve angels were at the gates, and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb were written on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The angel who was talking to me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The city was square: its length was the same as its width. He measured the city with his rod, and it was 12,000 stadia long. Its length, width, and height were the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He also measured its wall. According to the human measurement that the angel was using it was 144 cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Its wall was made of jasper. The city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The foundations of the city wall were decorated with all kinds of gems: The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The twelve gates were twelve pearls, and each gate was made of a single pearl. The street of the city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I saw no temple in it, because the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are its temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The city doesn't need any sun or moon to give it light, because the glory of God gave it light, and the lamb was its lamp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Its gates will never be shut by day, because there won't be any night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>People will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nothing unclean, or anyone who does anything detestable, and no one who tells lies will ever enter it. Only those whose names are written in the lamb's Book of Life will enter it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
