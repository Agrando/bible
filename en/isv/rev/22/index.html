It was flowing from the throne of God and the lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Between the street of the city and the river there was the tree of life visible from both sides. It produced twelve kinds of fruit, each month having its own fruit. The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and the lamb will be in the city. His servants will worship him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There will be no more night, and they will not need any light from lamps or the sun because the Lord God will shine on them. They will rule forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to me, “These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord God of the spirits and of the prophets has sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>“See! I am coming soon! How blessed is the person who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I, John, heard and saw these things. When I had heard and seen them, I bowed down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he told me, “Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you, your brothers the prophets, and those who keep the words in this book. Worship God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to me, “Don't seal up the words of the prophecy in this book, because the time is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the one who does what is evil continue to do evil, and let the filthy person continue to be filthy, and the righteous person continue to do what is right, and the holy person continue to be holy.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“See! I am coming soon! My reward is with me to repay everyone according to his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Outside are dogs, sorcerers, immoral people, murderers, idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give this testimony to you for the churches. I am the root and descendent of David, the bright morning star.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” Let everyone who hears this say, “Come!” Let everyone who is thirsty come! Let anyone who wants the water of life take it as a gift!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy in this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will strike him with the plagues that are written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If anyone takes away any words from the book of this prophecy, God will take away his portion of the tree of life and the holy city that are described in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The one who is testifying to these things says,“Yes, I am coming soon!”Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
