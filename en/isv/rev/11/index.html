I was told, “Stand up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count those who worship there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But don't measure the courtyard outside the temple. Leave that out, because it is given to the nations, and they will trample the Holy City for forty-two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will give my two witnesses who wear sackcloth the authority to prophesy for 1,260 days.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing in the presence of the Lord of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if anyone should want to hurt them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies. If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed in the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These witnesses have authority to shut the sky in order to keep rain from falling during the days of their prophesying. They also have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with any plague as often as they desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against them, conquer them, and kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For three and a half days some members of the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will look at their dead bodies and will not allow them to be placed in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Those living on earth will gloat over them, celebrate, and send gifts to each other, because these two prophets had tormented those living on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. Those who watched them were terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven calling to them, “Come up here!” So they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At that moment a powerful earthquake struck. One-tenth of the city collapsed, 7,000 people were killed by the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The second catastrophe is over. The third catastrophe is coming very soon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When the seventh angel blew his trumpet, there were loud voices in heaven, saying,	“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ,and he will rule forever and ever.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the twenty-four elders who were sitting on their thrones in God's presence fell on their faces and worshiped God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They said,	“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,who is and who was,because you have taken your great powerand have begun to rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The nations were angry,but your wrath has come.	It is time for the dead to be judged—to reward your servants, the prophets, the saints, and all who fear your name,both unimportant and important,and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen inside his temple. There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
