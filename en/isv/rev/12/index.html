Then the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that it could devour her child when it was born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>She gave birth to a son, a boy, who is to rule all the nations with an iron scepter. But her child was snatched away and taken to God and to his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where a place had been prepared for her by God so that she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then a war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels fought back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But it was not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The huge dragon was thrown down. That ancient serpent, called devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, was thrown down to the earth, and its angels were thrown down with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say,	“Now the salvation, the power,the kingdom of our God,and the authority of his Christ have come.	For the one accusing our brothers,the one who accuses them day and nightin the presence of our God, has been thrown out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They conquered him by the blood of the lamband by the word of their testimony,for they did not love their life even in the face of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So be glad, heavens, and those who live in them!	How terrible it is for the earth and the sea,because the devil has come down to you with great wrath,knowing that his time is short!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the dragon saw that it had been thrown down to the earth, it persecuted the woman who had given birth to the boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However, the woman was given the two wings of a large eagle so that she could fly away from the serpent to her place in the wilderness, where she could be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From its mouth the serpent poured water like a river behind the woman in order to sweep her away with the flood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had poured from its mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to do battle against the rest of her children, the ones who keep God's commandments and hold on to the testimony about Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
