The first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said,“Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Instantly I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne in heaven with a person seated on the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The person sitting there looked like jasper and carnelian, and there was a rainbow around the throne that looked like an emerald.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Around the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these thrones sat twenty-four elders wearing white robes and gold victor's crowns on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Flashes of lightning, noises, and peals of thunder came from the throne. Burning in front of the throne were seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In front of the throne was something like a sea of glass as clear as crystal. In the center of the throne and on each side of the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like an ox, the third living creature had a face like a human, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Each of the four living creatures had six wings and were full of eyes inside and out. Without stopping day or night they were singing,	“Holy, holy, holyis the Lord God Almighty,who was, who is, and who is coming.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the twenty-four elders bow down in front of the one who sits on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever. They throw their victor's crowns in front of the throne and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“You are worthy, our Lord and God,to receive glory, honor, and power,because you created all things,				and they came into existence				and were created because of your will.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
