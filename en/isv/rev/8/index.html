He was given a large quantity of incense to offer on the gold altar before the throne, along with the prayers of all the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The smoke from the incense and the prayers of the saints went up from the angel's hand to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth. Then there were peals of thunder, noises, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets got ready to blow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire were mixed with blood and thrown on the earth. One-third of the earth was burned up, one-third of the trees was burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. One-third of the sea turned into blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>one-third of the creatures that were living in the sea died, and one-third of the ships was destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the third angel blew his trumpet, a huge star blazing like a torch fell from heaven. It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The name of the star is Wormwood. One-third of the water turned into wormwood, and many people died from the water because it had turned bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, one-third of the sun, one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars were struck so that one-third of them turned dark. One-third of the day was kept from shining, and also the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying overhead say in a loud voice, “How terrible, how terrible, how terrible for those living on the earth, because of the blasts of the remaining trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
