Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>His judgments are true and just.He has condemned the notorious prostitutewho corrupted the world with her immorality.	He has taken revenge on herfor the blood of his servants.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A second time they said,	“Hallelujah!The smoke goes up from her forever and ever.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures bowed down and worshiped God, who was sitting on the throne. They said, “Amen! Hallelujah!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A voice came from the throne, saying,	“Praise our God,all who serve and fear him,from the least importantto the most important.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a large crowd, like the sound of raging waters, and like the sound of powerful thunderclaps, saying,	“Hallelujah!The Lord our God, the Almighty, is reigning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let us rejoice, be glad, and give him glory,because the marriage of the lamb has comeand his bride has made herself ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has been given the privilege of wearing fine linen,dazzling and pure.”(The fine linen represents the righteous deeds of the saints.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the angel said to me, “Write this: ‘How blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb!’” He also told me, “These are the true words of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I bowed down at his feet to worship him, but he told me, “Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold on to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, because the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw heaven standing open, and there was a white horse! Its rider is named Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and wages war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many royal crowns. He has a name written on him that nobody knows except himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The armies of heaven, wearing fine linen, white and pure, follow him on white horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A sharp sword comes out of his mouth to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod and tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>On his robe and his thigh he has a name written:KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead, “Come! Gather for the great supper of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of warriors, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, both free and slaves, both unimportant and important.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The beast was captured, along with the false prophet who had performed signs on its behalf. By these signs the false prophet had deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The rest were killed by the sword that belonged to the rider on the horse and that came from his mouth. And all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
