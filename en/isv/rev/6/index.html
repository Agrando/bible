I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Go!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then I looked, and there was a white horse! Its rider had a bow, and a victor's crown had been given to him. He went out as a conqueror to conquer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When the lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Go!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A second horse went out. It was fiery red, and its rider was given permission to take peace away from the earth and to make people slaughter one another. So he was given a large sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Go!” I looked, and there was a black horse! Its rider held a scale in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, or three quarts of barley for a denarius. But don't damage the olive oil or the wine!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Go!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I looked, and there was a pale horse! Its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. They were given authority over one-fourth of the earth to kill people using wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and the testimony they had given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They cried out in a loud voice, “Holy and true Sovereign, how long will it be before you judge and take revenge on those living on the earth who shed our blood?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Each of them was given a white robe. They were told to rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers was completed, who would be killed as they had been killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then I saw the lamb open the sixth seal. There was a powerful earthquake. The sun turned as black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon turned as red as blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The stars in the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree drops its fruit when it is shaken by a strong wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sky vanished like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the kings of the earth, the important people, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and all the slaves and free people hid themselves in caves and among the rocks in the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They said to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to endure it?”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
