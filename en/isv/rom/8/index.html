He condemned sin in the flesh</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>To set our minds on the flesh leads to death, but to set our minds on the Spirit leads to life and peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That is why the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile toward God. For it refuses to submit to the authority of God's law because it is powerless to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Indeed, those who are under the control of the flesh cannot please God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You, however, are not of the flesh but under the control of the Spirit, since God's Spirit lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if Christ is in you, your bodies are dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, then the one who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive by his Spirit who lives in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Consequently, brothers, we have an obligation—but it is not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you continually put to death the activities of the body, you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all who are led by God's Spirit are God's children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you have not received a spirit of slavery that leads you into fear again. Instead, you have received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba! Father!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now if we are children, we are heirs—heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ, if, in fact, we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the creation is eagerly waiting for God to reveal his children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because the creation was subjected to frustration, though not by its own choice. The one who subjected it did so in the hope</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that the creation itself would also be set free from slavery to decay in order to share the glorious freedom of God's children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that all creation has been groaning with the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>However, not only creation groans, but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit also groan inwardly as we eagerly wait for our adoption, the redemption of our bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For we were saved with this hope in mind. Now hope that is seen is not really hope, for who hopes for what can be seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the same way, the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how to pray as we should. But the Spirit himself intercedes with groans too deep for words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the one who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, for the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to God's will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that he works all things together for the good of those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And those whom he predestined, he also called; and those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What, then, can we say about all of this? If God is for us, who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The one who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for all of us—surely he will give us all things along with him, won't he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who can bring an accusation against God's chosen people? It is God who justifies them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who can condemn them? Christ Jesus, who died—and more importantly, who has been raised and is seated at the right hand of God—is the one who is also interceding for us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who can separate us from Christ's love? Can trouble, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, or a sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As it is written,	“For your sake we are being killed all day long.We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through the one who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor anything above, nor anything below, nor anything else in all creation can separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
