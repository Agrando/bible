It is in your mouth and in your heart.” This is the message of faith that we proclaim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If you declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For a person believes with his heart and is justified, and a person declares with his mouth and is saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be ashamed.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no difference between Jew and Greek, because they all have the same Lord, who gives richly to all who call on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How, then, can people call on someone they have not believed? And how can they believe in someone they have not heard about? And how can they hear without someone preaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written,	“How beautiful are the feet of thosewho bring the good news!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But not everyone has obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah asks,	“Lord, who has believed our message?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Consequently, faith comes from listening, and listening comes through the word of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I ask, “Didn't they hear?” Certainly they did! In fact,	“Their voice has gone out into the whole world,and their words to the ends of the earth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I ask, “Did Israel not understand?” Moses was the first to say,	“I will make you jealousby those who are not a nation;	I will make you angryby a nation that doesn't understand.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaiah boldly says,	“I was found by those who were not looking for me;I was revealed to those who were not asking for me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But about Israel he says,	“All day long I have held out my handsto a disobedient and rebellious people.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
