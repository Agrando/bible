His own Lord will determine whether he stands or falls. And stand he will, because God is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One person decides that one day is better than another, while another person decides that all days are the same. Each one must be fully convinced in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The one who observes a special day, observes it to honor the Lord. The one who eats, eats to honor the Lord, since he gives thanks to God. And the one who does not eat, refrains from eating to honor the Lord; yet he, too, gives thanks to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If we live, we live to honor the Lord; and if we die, we die to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this reason Christ died and returned to life, so that he might become the Lord of both the dead and the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Why, then, do you criticize your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For all of us will stand before the judgment seat of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written,	“As certainly as I live, declares the Lord,every knee will bow to me,and every tongue will praise God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Consequently, each of us will give an account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, let us no longer criticize each other. Instead, make up your mind not to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in and of itself. But it is unclean to a person who thinks it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if your brother is being hurt by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not destroy the person for whom Christ died by what you eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not allow your good to be spoken of as evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God's kingdom does not consist of food and drink, but of righteousness, peace, and joy produced by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the person who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, let us keep on pursuing those things that bring peace and that lead to building one another up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not destroy God's work for the sake of food. Everything is clean, but it is wrong to make another person fall because of what you eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The right thing to do is to avoid eating meat, drinking wine, or doing anything else that makes your brother stumble or become upset or weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As for the faith you do have, have it as your own conviction before God. How blessed is the person who has no reason to condemn himself because of what he approves!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the person who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act in faith; and anything that is not done in faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
