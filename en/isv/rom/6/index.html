Should we go on sinning so that grace may increase?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Of course not! How can we who died as far as sin is concerned go on living in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into union with Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore, through baptism we were buried with him into his death so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the Father's glory, we too may live an entirely new life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if we have become united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We know that our old selves were crucified with him so that our sinful bodies might be rendered powerless and we might no longer be slaves to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the person who has died has been freed from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for we know that Christ, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For when he died, he died once and for all as far as sin is concerned. But now that he is alive, he lives for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the same way, you too must continually consider yourselves dead as far as sin is concerned, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, do not let sin rule your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Stop offering the parts of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness. Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have been brought from death to life and the parts of your body as instruments of righteousness to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For sin will not have mastery over you, because you are not under law but under grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What, then, does this mean? Should we go on sinning because we are not under law but under grace? Of course not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obeyâ€”either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thank God that, though you were once slaves of sin, you became obedient from your hearts to that form of teaching with which you were entrusted!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And since you have been freed from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am speaking in human terms because of the frailty of your flesh. Just as you once offered the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater disobedience, so now, in the same way, you must offer the parts of your body as slaves to righteousness that leads to sanctification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free as far as righteousness was concerned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What benefit did you get from doing those things you are now ashamed of? For those things resulted in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now that you have been freed from sin and have become God's slaves, the benefit you reap is sanctification, and the result is eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in union with Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
