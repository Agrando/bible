So if your gift is prophecy, use your gift in proportion to your faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If your gift is serving, devote yourself to serving others. If it is teaching, devote yourself to teaching others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If it is encouraging, devote yourself to encouraging others. If it is sharing, share generously. If it is leading, lead enthusiastically. If it is helping, help cheerfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Your love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be devoted to each other with mutual affection. Excel in showing respect for each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Never be lazy in showing such devotion. Be on fire with the Spirit. Serve the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be joyful in hope, patient in trouble, and persistent in prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Supply the needs of the saints. Extend hospitality to strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Bless those who persecute you. Keep on blessing them, and never curse them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Rejoice with those who are rejoicing. Cry with those who are crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Live in harmony with each other. Do not be arrogant, but associate with humble people. Do not think that you are wiser than you really are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not pay anyone back evil for evil, but focus your thoughts on what is right in the sight of all people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If possible, so far as it depends on you, live in peace with all people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not take revenge, dear fiends, but leave room for God's wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me. I will pay them back, declares the Lord.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But “if your enemy is hungry, feed him. For if he is thirsty, give him a drink. If you do this, you will pile burning coals on his head.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
