But if her husband dies, she is free from this law, so that she is not an adulterer if she marries another man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In the same way, my brothers, through Christ's body you also died as far as the law is concerned, so that you may belong to another person, the one who was raised from the dead, and may bear fruit for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For while we were living in the flesh, sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies to bear fruit for death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now we have been released from the law by dying to what enslaved us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit, not under the old written code.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What should we say, then? Is the law sinful? Of course not! In fact, I wouldn't have known sin if it had not been for the law. For I wouldn't have known what it means to covet if the law had not said, “You must not covet.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin seized the opportunity provided by this commandment and produced in me all kinds of sinful desires. For apart from the law, sin is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>At one time I was alive without any connection to the law. But when the commandment came, sin sprang to life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and I died. I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, seizing the opportunity provided by the commandment, deceived me and used it to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, the law itself is holy, and the commandment is holy, just, and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now, did something good bring me death? Of course not! But in order that sin might be recognized as sin, it used something good to cause my death, so that through the commandment sin might become more sinful than ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am mere flesh, sold as a slave to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I don't understand what I am doing. For I don't do what I want to do, but instead do what I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now if I do what I don't want to do, I agree that the law is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As it is, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that lives in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but I cannot carry it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I don't do the good I want to do, but instead do the evil that I don't want to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I do what I don't want to do, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that lives in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So I find this to be a law: when I want to do what is good, evil is right there with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I delight in the law of God in my inner being,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I see in my body a different law waging war with the law in my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin that exists in my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, with my mind I myself serve the law of God, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
