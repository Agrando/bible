May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be yours!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>First of all, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because the news about your faith is being reported throughout the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For God, whom I serve in my spirit by preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>in my prayers at all times, asking that somehow by God's will I may at last succeed in coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I am longing to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now), so that I might reap a harvest among you, just as I have among the rest of the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish people, I am a debtor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That is why I am so eager to proclaim the gospel to you who live in Rome, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is God's power for the salvation of everyone who believes, of the Jew first and of the Greek as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in it God's righteousness is being revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, “The righteous will live by faith.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and wickedness of those who in their wickedness suppress the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God himself has made it plain to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes—his eternal power and divine nature—have been understood and observed by what he made, so that people are without excuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him. Instead, their thoughts turned to worthless things, and their ignorant hearts were darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Though claiming to be wise, they became fools</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images that looked like mortal human beings, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this reason, God gave them over to impurity to follow the lusts of their hearts and to dishonor their bodies with one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They exchanged God's truth for a lie and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this reason, God gave them over to degrading passions. Even their females exchanged their natural sexual function for one that is unnatural.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In the same way, their males also abandoned the natural sexual function of females and burned with lust for one another. Males committed indecent acts with males, and received in themselves the appropriate penalty for their perversion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Furthermore, because they did not think it worthwhile to retain the full knowledge of God, God gave them over to degraded minds to perform acts that should not be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and viciousness. They are gossips,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>slanderers, God-haters, haughty, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to their parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Although they know God's just requirement—that those who practice such things deserve to die—they not only do these things but even applaud others who practice them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
