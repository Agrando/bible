For when you pass judgment on another person, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, practice the very same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Now we know that God's judgment against those who practice such is based on truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on those who practice these things and then do them yourself, do you think you will escape God's judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or do you think so little of the riches of his kindness, forbearance, and patience, not realizing that it is God's kindness that is leading you to repentance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But because of your stubborn and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he will repay everyone according to what that person has done:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>eternal life to those who strive for glory, honor, and immortality by patiently doing good;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but wrath and fury for those who in their selfish pride refuse to believe the truth and practice wickedness instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There will be suffering and anguish for every human being who practices doing evil, for Jews first and for Greeks as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who practices doing good, for Jews first and for Greeks as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For God does not show partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it is not merely those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight. No, it is those who do the law, who will be justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For whenever Gentiles, who do not possess the law, do instinctively what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They show that what the law requires is written in their hearts, a fact to which their own consciences testify, and their thoughts will either accuse or excuse them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>on that day when God, through Jesus Christ, will judge people's secrets according to my gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law, and boast about God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and know his will, and approve of what is best because you have been instructed in the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>an instructor of ignorant people, and a teacher of infants because you have the full content of knowledge and truth in the law—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>as you teach others, do you fail to teach yourself? As you preach against stealing, do you steal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As you forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? As you abhor idols, do you rob temples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As you boast about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As it is written, “God's name is being blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For circumcision is valuable if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, his uncircumcision will be regarded as circumcision, won't it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The man who is uncircumcised physically but who keeps the law will condemn you who break the law, even though you have the written law and circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For a person is not a Jew because of his appearance, nor is circumcision something external and physical.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>No, a person is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by a written law. That person's praise will come from God, not from people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
