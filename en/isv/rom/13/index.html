The existing authorities have been established by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>so that whoever resists the authorities opposes what God has established, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the authorities are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you like to live without being afraid of the authorities? Then do what is right, and you will receive their approval.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For they are God's servants working for your good. But if you do what is wrong, you should be afraid, for it is not without reason that they bear the sword. Indeed, they are God's servants to execute wrath on anyone who does wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore, it is necessary for you to be subject, not only because of God's wrath but also because of your own conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is also why you pay taxes. For rulers are God's servants faithfully devoting themselves to their work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Pay everyone whatever you owe them—taxes to whom taxes are due, tolls to whom tolls are due, fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not owe anyone anything—except to love one another. For the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the commandments, “You must not commit adultery; you must not murder; you must not steal; you must not covet,” and every other commandment are summed up in this statement: “You must love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love never does anything that is harmful to its neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is necessary because you know the times—that it's time for you to wake up from sleep. For our salvation is nearer now than when we became believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is almost over, and the day is near. Let us therefore put aside the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us behave decently, as people who live in the light of day. No wild parties, drunkenness, sexual immorality, promiscuity, rivalry, or jealousy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Instead, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not obey your flesh and its desires.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
