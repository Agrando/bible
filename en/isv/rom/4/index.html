For we say, “Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Under what circumstances was it credited? Was he circumcised or uncircumcised? He had not been circumcised, but was uncircumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Afterward he received the mark of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. Therefore, he is the ancestor of all who believe while uncircumcised, in order that righteousness may be credited to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He is also the ancestor of the circumcised—those who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law, but through the righteousness produced by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if those who were given the law are the heirs, then faith is useless and the promise is worthless,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for the law brings about wrath. Now where there is no law, neither can there be any violation of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, the promise is based on faith, so that it may be a matter of grace and may be guaranteed for all his descendants—not only for those who were given the law, but also for those who share Abraham's faith, who is the father of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations.” Abraham acted in faith when he stood in God's presence, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence things that don't even exist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hoping in spite of hopeless circumstances, he believed that he would become “the father of many nations,” just as he had been told: “This is how many descendants you will have.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He did not weaken in faith when he thought about his own body (which was already as good as dead now that he was about a hundred years old) or about Sarah's inability to have children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>nor did he doubt God's promise out of a lack of faith. Instead, he became strong in faith and gave glory to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>being absolutely convinced that God would do what he had promised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This is why “it was credited to him as righteousness.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now the words “it was credited to him” were written not only for him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but also for us. Our faith will be regarded in the same way, if we believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He was handed over to death because of our sins and was raised to life because of our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
