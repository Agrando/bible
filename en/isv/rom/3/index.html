First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the utterances of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>What if some of them were unfaithful? Their unfaithfulness cannot cancel God's faithfulness, can it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Of course not! God is true, even if everyone else is a liar. As it is written,	“You are right when you speak,and win your case when you go into court.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness serves to confirm God's righteousness, what can we say? God is not unrighteous when he vents his wrath on us, is he? (I am talking in human terms.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Of course not! Otherwise, how could God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if through my falsehood God's truthfulness increases to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Or can we say—as some people slander us by claiming that we say—“Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What, then, does this mean? Are we Jews any better off? Not at all! For we have already accused everyone, both Jews and Greeks, of being under the power of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As it is written,	“Not even one person is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No one understands.No one searches for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All have turned away.Together they have become worthless.No one shows kindness, not even one person!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throats are open graves.With their tongues they practice deception.The venom of poisonous snakes is under their lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ruin and misery mark their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They have not learned the path to peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that whatever the law says applies to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, no human being will be justified in God's sight by means of the works prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the full knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now, apart from the law, God's righteousness is revealed and is attested by the Law and the Prophets—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>God's righteousness through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>since all have sinned and continue to fall short of God's glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By his grace they are justified freely through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God offered as a place where atonement by Christ's blood could occur through faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because he had waited patiently to deal with sins committed in the past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He wanted to demonstrate at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the person who has the faithfulness of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>What, then, is there to boast about? That has been eliminated. On what principle? On that of works? No, but on the principle of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works prescribed by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the Gentiles, too? Yes, of the Gentiles, too,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>since there is only one God who will justify the circumcised on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised by that same faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we, then, abolish the law by this faith? Of course not! Instead, we uphold the law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
