He is a type of the one who would come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But God's free gift is not like Adam's offense. For if many people died as the result of one man's offense, how much more have God's grace and the free gift given through the kindness of one man, Jesus Christ, been showered on many people!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Nor can the free gift be compared to what came through the man who sinned. For the sentence that followed one man's offense brought condemnation, but the free gift brought justification, even after many offenses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if, through one man, death ruled because of that man's offense, how much more will those who receive such overflowing grace and the gift of righteousness rule in life because of one man, Jesus Christ!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Consequently, just as one offense resulted in condemnation for everyone, so one act of righteousness results in justification and life for everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For just as through one man's disobedience many people were made sinners, so also through one man's obedience many people will be made righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the law crept in so that the offense would increase. But where sin increased, grace increased even more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>so that, just as sin ruled by bringing death, so also grace might rule by bringing justification that results in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
