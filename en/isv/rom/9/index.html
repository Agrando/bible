To them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, according to the flesh, Christ descended, who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all Israelites truly belong to Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and not all of Abraham's descendants are his true descendants. On the contrary, “It is through Isaac that descendants will be named for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, it is not the children of natural descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this is the language of promise: “At this time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Not only that, but Rebecca became pregnant by our ancestor Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yet before their children had been born or had done anything good or bad (so that God's plan of election might continue to operate</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>according to his calling and not by works), Rebecca was told, “The older child will serve the younger one.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What can we say, then? God is not unrighteous, is he? Of course not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he says to Moses, “I will be merciful to the person I want to be merciful to, and I will be kind to the person I want to be kind to.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore, God's choice does not depend on a person's will or effort, but on God himself, who shows mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh,	“I have raised you up for this very purpose,to demonstrate my power in you	and that my name might be proclaimedin all the earth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore, God has mercy on whomever he chooses, and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You may ask me, “Then why does God still find fault with anybody? For who can resist his will?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On the contrary, who are you—mere man that you are—to talk back to God? Can an object that was molded say to the one who molded it, “Why did you make me like this?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A potter has the right to do what he wants to with his clay, doesn't he? He can make something for a special occasion or something for ordinary use from the same lump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now if God wants to demonstrate his wrath and reveal his power, can't he be extremely patient with the objects of his wrath that are made for destruction?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can't he also reveal his glorious riches to the objects of his mercy that he has prepared ahead of time for glory—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>including us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but from the Gentiles as well?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As he says in Hosea,	“Those who are not my peopleI will call my people,	and the one who was not lovedI will call my loved one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the very place where it was said to them,‘You are not my people,’they will be called children of the living God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaiah also calls out concerning Israel,	“Although the descendants of Israelare as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore,only a few will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the Lord will carry out his planand shorten it in righteousness,because he will carry out his plan on the earth decisively.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is just as Isaiah predicted:	“If the Lord of the Heavenly Armieshad not left us some descendants,we would have become like Sodomand would have been compared to Gomorrah.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What can we say, then? Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, have attained righteousness, a righteousness that comes through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel, who did pursue the righteousness that is based on the law, did not arrive at that law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why not? Because they did not pursue it on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on works. They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As it is written,	“Look! I am placing a stone in Zionthat people will stumble over	and a large rock that will make them fall,and the one who believes in him will never be ashamed.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
