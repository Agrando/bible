Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Mary took a pound of very expensive perfume made of pure nard and anointed Jesus’ feet. She wiped his feet with her hair, and the house became filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was going to betray him, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>“Why wasn't this perfume sold for 300 denarii and the money given to the destitute?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said this, not because he cared about the destitute, but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the moneybag and would steal what was put into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jesus said,“Leave her alone, so that she might keep it for the day of my burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For you will always have the destitute with you, but you will not always have me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the large crowd of Jews realized that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the high priests planned to kill Lazarus, too,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>since he was the reason why so many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The next day the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting,	“Hosanna!	How blessed is the one who comesin the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“Stop being afraid, daughter of Zion.	Look, your king is coming,sitting upon a donkey's colt!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At first his disciples didn't understand these things. However, when Jesus had been glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that people had done these things to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify to what they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This accounts for the crowd going out to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You see, there is nothing you can do. Look, the world has gone after him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now some Greeks were among those who had come up to worship at the festival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They went to Philip (who was from Bethsaida in Galilee) and told him, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip went and told Andrew, and Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to them,“The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly I tell you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it produces a lot of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The one who loves his life will destroy it, and the one who hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone serves me, he must follow me. And where I am, there my servant will also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>“Now my soul is in turmoil, and what should I say—‘Father, save me from this hour’? No! It was for this very reason that I came to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify your name.”Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The crowd standing there heard this and said that it was thunder. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus replied, “This voice has come for your benefit, not for mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the time for the judgment of this world to begin.Now will the ruler of this world be thrown out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As for me, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people to myself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said this to indicate the kind of death he was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the crowd answered him, “We have learned from the law that the Christ remains forever. So how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to them,“The light is among you only for a short time. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. The person who walks in the darkness is in the darkness and does not know where he is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As long as you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light.” After Jesus had said this, he went away and hid from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Although he had performed numerous signs in their presence, they did not believe in him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>so that the word that the prophet Isaiah spoke might be fulfilled when he said:	“Lord, who has believed our message,and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah also said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>“He has blinded their eyesand hardened their heart,	so that they might not perceive with their eyes,and understand with their heart and turn,and I would heal them.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah said this when he saw his glory and spoke about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Yet many people, even some of the authorities, believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not admit it for fear that they would be thrown out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For they loved the praise of people more than the praise of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then Jesus said loudly,“The one who believes in me does not believe in me but in the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The one who sees me sees the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come into the world as light, so that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not condemn him, for I did not come to condemn the world but to save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has something to judge him: The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken on my own authority. Instead, the Father who sent me has himself given me a commandment about what to say and how to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I speak, therefore, I speak just as the Father has told me.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
