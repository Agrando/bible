Glorify your Son, so that the Son may glorify you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Foryou have given him authority over all humanityso that he might give eternal life to all those you gave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And this is eternal life: to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent—Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I glorified you on earth by completing the task you gave me to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world existed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have made your name known to the men you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now they realize that everything you gave me comes from you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>because the words that you gave me I have given to them. They have received them and know for sure that I came from you. And they have believed that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am asking on their behalf. I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those you gave me, for they are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All that is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine, and I have been glorified in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by your name, the namethat you gave me, so that they may be one, as we are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While I was with them, I protected them by your name that you gave me.

Just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you, may they also be onein us, so that the world may believe that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I have given them the glory that you gave me, so that they may be one, just as we are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am in them, and you are in me. May they be completely one, so that the world may know that you sent me and that you have loved them as you loved me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am and to see my glory, which you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“Righteous Father, the world has never known you. Yet I have known you, and these men have known that you sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I made your name known to them, and will continue to make it known, so that the love you have for memay be in them and I myself may be in them.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
