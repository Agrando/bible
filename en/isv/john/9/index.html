This happened so thatthe works of God might be revealed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Imust work the works of the one who sent mewhile it is day. Night is coming, when no one can work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After saying this, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he spread the mud on the man's eyes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and told him,“Go and wash in the pool of Siloam” (which is translated “Sent One”). So he went off and washed and came back seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the neighbors and those who had previously seen him as a beggar said, “This is the man who used to sit and beg, isn't it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some were saying, “It is he,” while others were saying, “No, but it is someone like him.”He himself kept saying, “It is I!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they said to him, “How, then, were your eyes opened?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said, “The man named Jesus made some mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me,‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So off I went and washed, and I received my sight.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They said to him, “Where is that man?”He said, “I don't know!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they brought to the Pharisees the man who had once been blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had received his sight. He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, then I washed, and now I can see.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some of the Pharisees began to remark, “This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.”But others were saying, “How can a sinful man perform such signs?” And there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, for it was your eyes he opened?”He said, “He is a prophet.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had been given sight until they summoned his parents</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and asked them, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? How does he now see?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents replied, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we don't know how it is that he now sees, and we don't know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age and can speak for himself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Christ would be thrown out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That's why his parents said, “He is of age. Ask him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So for a second time they summoned the man who had been blind and told him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he responded, “I don't know whether he is a sinner or not. The one thing I do know is that I used to be blind and now I can see!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them, “I've already told you, but you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become his disciples, too, do you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At this, they turned on him furiously and said, “You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this fellow comes from.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered them, “This is an amazing thing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he does listen to anyone who worships him and does his will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Never since creation has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man who was born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he couldn't do anything like that.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They said to him, “You were born entirely in sins, and you are trying to instruct us?” And they threw him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out. So when he found him, he said,“Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered, “And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him,“You have seen him. He is the person who is talking with you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said, “Lord, I do believe,” and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Jesus said,“I have come into this world for judgment, so that those who are blind may see, and those who see may become blind.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Some of the Pharisees who were near him overheard this and said to him, “We aren't blind, too, are we?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus told them,“If you were blind, you would not have any sin. But now that you insist, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
