Her brother Lazarus was the one who was ill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So the sisters sent word to Jesus, saying, “Lord, the one whom you love is ill.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when Jesus heard it, he said,“This illness is not meant to end in death. It is for God's glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed where he was for two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After this he said to the disciples,“Let's go back to Judea.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The disciples said to him, “Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you to death, and you are going back there again?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus replied,“There are twelve hours in the day, aren't there? If anyone walks during the day he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if anyone walks at night he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These were the things he said. Then after this he told them,“Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am leaving to wake him up.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about resting or sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus told them plainly,“Lazarus has died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let's go to him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “Let's go, too, so that we may die with him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give it to you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus told her,“Your brother will rise again.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her,“I am the resurrection and the life.The person who believes in me, even though he dies, will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Indeed, everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one who was to come into the world.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When she had said this, she went away and called her sister Mary and told her privately, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus had not yet arrived at the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the Jews who had been with her, consoling her in the house, saw Mary get up quickly and go out, they followed her, thinking that she had gone to the tomb to cry there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>As soon as Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, he was greatly troubled in spirit and deeply moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He said,“Where have you put him?”They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus burst into tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So the Jews said, “See how much he loved him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But some of them said, “Surely the one who opened the eyes of the blind man could have kept this man from dying, couldn't he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Groaning deeply again, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said,“Remove the stone.”Martha, the dead man's sister, told him, “Lord, there must be a stench by now, because he's been dead for four days.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said to her,“I told you that if you believed you would see God's glory, didn't I?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they removed the stone.Then Jesus looked upward and said,“Father, I thank you for hearing me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I know that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After saying this, he shouted with a loud voice,“Lazarus, come out!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The dead man came out, his hands and feet tied with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus told them,“Untie him, and let him go.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Many of the Jews who had come with Mary and had observed what Jesus did believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said, “What are we going to do? This man is performing many signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our nation.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, told them, “You don't know anything!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>You don't realize that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Now he did not say this on his own initiative. As high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not only for the nation, but that he would also gather into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So from that day on they resolved to put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>As a result, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews. Instead, he went from there to a town called Ephraim in the region near the wilderness. There he remained with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now the Jewish Passover was approaching, and before the Passover many people from the countryside went up to Jerusalem to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They kept looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? Surely he won't come to the festival, will he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now the high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that whoever knew where he was should tell them so that they could arrest him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
