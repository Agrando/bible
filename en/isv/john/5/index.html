It has five colonnades,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and under these a large number of sick people were lying—blind, lame, or paralyzed—waiting for the movement of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For at certain times an angel of the Lord would go down into the pool and stir up the water. And the one who stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One particular man was there who had been ill for thirty-eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him,“Do you want to get well?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The sick man answered him, “Sir, I don't have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I'm trying to get there, someone else steps down ahead of me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus said to him,“Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The man immediately became well, and he picked up his mat and started walking. Now that day was a Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he answered them, “The man who made me well told me,‘Pick up your mat and walk.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They asked him, “Who is the man who told you,‘Pick it up and walk’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the one who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away from the crowd in that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Later on, Jesus found him in the temple and told him,“See, you have become well. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man went off and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the Jews began persecuting Jesus because he kept doing such things on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus answered them,“My Father has been working until now, and I, too, am working.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the Jews were trying all the harder to kill him, because he was not only breaking the Sabbath but was also calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus said to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing on his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing. For what he does, the Son does likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. And he will show him even greater works than these, so that you may be amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to those he chooses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>so that all may honor the Son as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“Truly, truly I tell you, the one who hears my word and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and does not come under judgment, but has passed from death to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly, truly I tell you, the hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear it will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted the Son to have life in himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he has given him authority to pass judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Don't be amazed at this, because the hour is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and will come out—those who have done what is good to the resurrection of life, and those who have practiced what is evil to the resurrection of condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can do nothing on my own accord. As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is another who testifies about me, and I knowthat the testimony he gives about me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You have sent messengersto John, and he has testified to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I myself do not accept human testimony, but I am saying these things so that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That man was a lamp that burns and brightly shines, and for a while you were willing to rejoice in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have a greater testimony than John's, for the works that the Father has given me to complete, the very works that I am doing, testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Moreover, the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen his appearance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>nor do you have his word abiding in you, because you do not believe in the one whom he sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You examine the Scriptures carefully because you suppose that in them you have eternal life. Yet they testify about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But you are not willing to come to me to have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>“I do not accept human praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I know that you do not have the love of God in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me. Yet if another man comes in his own name, you will accept him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you believe when you accept each other's praise and do not look for the praise that comes from the only God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not suppose that I will be the one to accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom you have set your hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, for it was about me that he wrote.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe my words?”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
