The disciples didn't realize it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus said to them, “Children, you don't have any fish, do you?”They answered him, “No.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He told them,“Throw the net on the right hand side of the boat, and you'll catchsome.” So they threw it out and were unable to haul it in because it was so full of fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That disciple whom Jesus kept loving said to Peter, “It's the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put back on his clothes, for he was practically naked, and jumped into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were only about a hundred yards away from the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they arrived at the shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish lying on it, and some bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus told them,“Bring me some of the fish you've just caught.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish—153 of them. And although there were so many of them, the net was not torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jesus said to them,“Come, have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?”, for they knew it was the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus went and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter,“Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?”He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”Jesus told him,“Feed my lambs.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he said to him a second time,“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”He said to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”Jesus told him,“Take care of my sheep.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to him a third time,“Simon, son of John, do you love me?”Peter was deeply hurt that he had said to him a third time,“Do you love me?”So he said to him, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you!”Jesus told him,“Feed my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“Truly, truly I tell you, when you were young, you would fasten your belt and go wherever you liked. But when you get old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten your belt and take you where you don't want to go.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now he said this to show by what kind of death he would glorify God.After saying this, he told him,“Keep following me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Peter turned around and noticed the disciple whom Jesus kept loving following them. He was the one who had put his head on Jesus’ chest at the supper and had said, “Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Peter saw him, he said, “Lord, what about him?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to him,“If it is my will for him to remain until I come, how does that concern you? You must keep following me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple wasn't going to die. Yet Jesus didn't say to him that he wasn't going to die, but,“If it is my will for him to remain until I come, how does that concern you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Of course, Jesus also did many other things, and I suppose that if every one of them were written down the world couldn't contain the books that would be written.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
