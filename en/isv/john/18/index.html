So if you are looking for me, let these men go.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken,“I did not lose a single one of those you gave me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus told Peter,“Put your sword back into its sheath. Shouldn't I drink the cup that the Father has given me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the soldiers, along with their commander and the Jewish officers, arrested Jesus and tied him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>First they brought him to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Caiaphas was the person who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one man die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since the other disciple was known to the high priest, he accompanied Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Peter, however, stood outside the gate. So this other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The young woman at the gate said to Peter, “You aren't one of this man's disciples, too, are you?”He said, “I am not.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Meanwhile, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had built and were warming themselves because it was cold. Peter was also standing with them, keeping himself warm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his own teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered him,“I have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue or in the temple, where all Jews meet together, and I have said nothing in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why do you question me? Question those who heard what I said. These are the people who know what I said.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Jesus on the face and said, “Is that any way to answer the high priest?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him,“If I have said anything wrong, tell me what it was.But if I have told the truth, why do you hit me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Annas sent him, with his hands tied, to Caiaphas the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Meanwhile, Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, “You aren't one of his disciples, too, are you?”He denied it by saying, “I am not!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then one of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “I saw you in the garden with him, didn't I?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peter again denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters. It was early in the morning, and the Jews did not go into the headquarters for fear that they might become unclean and be unable to eat the Passover meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So Pilate came out to them and said, “What accusation are you bringing against this man?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered him, “If he weren't a criminal, we wouldn't have handed him over to you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pilate told them, “You take him and try him according to your law.”The Jews said to him, “It is not legal for us to put anyone to death.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Pilate went back into the governor's headquarters, summoned Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus replied,“Are you asking this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate replied, “I am not a Jew, am I? It is your own nation and high priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered,“My kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom belonged to this world, my servants would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.But for now my kingdom is not from here.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?”Jesus answered,“You say that I am a king. I was born for this, and I came into the world for this: to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate said to him, “What is ‘truth’?” After he said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, “I find no basis for a charge against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But you have a custom that I release one person for you at Passover. Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>At this, they shouted out again, “Not this fellow, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
