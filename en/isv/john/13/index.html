Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>By supper time, the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was returning to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>got up from the table, removed his outer robe, and took a towel and fastened it around his waist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then he poured some water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel that was tied around his waist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered him,“You do not realize now what I am doing, but later on you will understand.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said to him, “You must never wash my feet!”Jesus answered him,“Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not just my feet, but my hands and my head as well!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus told him,“The person who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but is entirely clean. And you menare clean, though not all of you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said,“Not all of you are clean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer robe, he sat down again and said to them,“Do you realize what I have done to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right because that is what I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you must also wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, so that you may do as I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Truly, truly I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master, and a messenger is not greater than the one who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you understand these things, how blessed you are if you put them into practice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I'm not talking about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But the Scripture must be fulfilled: ‘The one who ate bread with mehas lifted up his heel againstme.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I'm telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it does happen you may believe that I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly I tell you, the one who receives whomever I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After saying this, Jesus was deeply troubled in spirit and declared solemnly,“Truly, truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples began looking at one another, completely mystified about whom he was speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One of his disciples, the one whom Jesus kept loving, was sitting very close to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Simon Peter motioned to this man to ask Jesus of whom he was speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Leaning forward on Jesus’ chest, he asked him, “Lord, who is it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answered,“He is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish.”Then he took a piece of bread, dipped it, and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After he had taken the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him,“Do quickly what you are going to do!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Some thought that, since Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him to buy what they needed for the festival or to give something to the destitute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Judas took the piece of bread and immediately went outside. And it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When he had gone out, Jesus said,“The Son of Man is now glorified, and God has been glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify the Son of Manin himself, and he will glorify him at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me, but what I told the JewsI now tell you, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I am giving you a new commandment to love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?”Jesus answered him,“I am going where you cannot follow me now, though you will follow later on.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said to him, “Lord, why can't I follow you now? I would lay down my life for you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answered him,“Would you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly I tell you, a rooster will certainly not crow until you have denied me three times.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
