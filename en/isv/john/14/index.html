Believein God, believe also in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There are many rooms in my Father's house. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going away to prepare a place for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if I am going away to prepare a place for you, I will come again and will welcome you into my presence, so that you may be where I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You know where I am going, and you know the way.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to him,“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you have known me, you will also know my Father. From now on you know him and have seen him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will satisfy us.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said to him,“Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? The person who has seen me has seen the Father. So how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You believe, don't you, that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own. It is the Father who dwells in me who does his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe me, I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Otherwise, believe mebecause of the works themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“Truly, truly I tell you, the one who believes in me will also do the works that I am doing. He will do even greater works than these because I am going to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you ask mefor anything in my name, I will do it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“If you love me, keepmy commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will ask the Father to giveyou another Helper, to be with you always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, for it neither sees him nor recognizes him. But you recognize him, for he abides with you and will be inyou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am not going to forsake you like orphans. I will come back to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>“In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On that day you will know that I am in my Father and that you are in me and that I am in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The person who has my commandments and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I, too, will love him and reveal myself to him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, “Lord, how is it that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him,“If anyone loves me, he will keep my word. Then my Father will love him, and we will go to him and make our home within him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The one who does not love me does not keep my words. The word that you hear is not mine, but comes from the Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“I have told you this while I am still with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of all that I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I am leaving peace with you. I am giving you my own peace. I am not giving it to you as the world gives. So do not let your hearts be troubled, and do not let them be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have heard me tell you, ‘I am going away, but I am coming back to you.’ If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I have told you this now, before it happens, so that when it does happen you will believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will not talk with you much longer, for the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But I am doing what the Father has commanded me to let the world know that I love the Father. Get up! Let us leave this place.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
