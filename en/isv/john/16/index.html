Yes, an hour is coming when the one who kills you will think he is serving God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They will do this because they have not known the Father or me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I have told you this so that when their hour comes you may remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you this in the beginning, because I was with you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>“But now I am going to the one who sent me. Yet none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have told you this, sorrow has filled your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However, I am telling you the truth. It is for your advantage that I am going away, for if I do not go away the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When he comes, he will convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>of sin, because they do not believe in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and of judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“I still have a lot to say to you, but you cannot bear it now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet when the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. For he will not speak on his own accord, but will speak whatever he hears and will declare to you the things that are to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All that the Father has is mine. That is why I said, ‘He will take what is mine and declare it to you.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In a little while you will no longer see me, then in a little while you will see me again.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At this point, some of his disciples said to each another, “What does he mean by telling us,‘In a little while you will no longer see me, then in a little while you will see me again,’ and‘because I am going to the Father’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They kept saying, “What is this‘in a little while’ that he keeps talking about? We don't know what he means.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him a question, so he said to them,“Are you discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said, ‘In a little while you will no longer see me, then in a little while you will see me again’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly I tell you, you will cry and mourn, but the world will rejoice. You will be deeply distressed, but your pain will turn into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Whena woman is in labor she has pain, for her hour has come. Yet when she has given birth to her child, she doesn't remember the agony anymore because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now you are having pain. But I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On that day, you will not ask me for anything. Truly, truly I tell you, whatever you ask the Father for in my name, he will give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So far you haven't asked for anything in my name. Keep asking and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“I have said these things to you in figurative language. The hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but will tell you plainly about the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On that day, you will ask in my name. I am not telling you that I will ask the Father on your behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I left the Father and have come into the world. NowI am leaving the world and going back to the Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said, “Well, now you're speaking plainly and not using figurative language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that you know everything and do not need to have anyone ask you questions. Because of this, we believe that you have come from God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them,“Do you now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Listen, the hour is coming, indeed it has already come, when you will be scattered, each of you to his own home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Ihave told you this so that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have trouble, but be courageous—I have overcome the world!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
