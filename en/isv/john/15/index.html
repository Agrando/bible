Just as the branch cannot produce fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, you are the branches. The one who abides in me while I abide in himproduces much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Unless a person abides in me, he is thrown away like a branch and dries up. People gather such branchesand throw them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you can ask for anything you want, and it will be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This is how my Father is glorified, when you produce a lot of fruit and prove to be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Just as the Father has loved me, so I have loved you. So abide in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have told you this so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“This is my commandment: that you love one another as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one showsgreater love than when he lays down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are my friends if you do what I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I do not call you servants anymore, because a servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. I have appointed you to go and produce fruit that will last,so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I am giving you these commandments so that you may love one another.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“If the world hates you, you should realize that it hated me before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. But because you do not belong to the world and I have chosen you out of it,the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I spoke to you: ‘A servant is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have any sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The person who hates me also hates my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have any sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But this happened so thatthe word written in their law might be fulfilled: ‘They hated me for no reason.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>“When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You will testify also, because you have been with me from the beginning.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
