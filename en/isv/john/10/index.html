He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When he has driven out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him because they do not recognize the voice of strangers.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus used this illustration with them, but they didn't understand what he was saying to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So again Jesus said,“Truly, truly I tell you, I am the gate for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All who came before meare thieves and bandits, but the sheep did not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the gate. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief comes only to steal, slaughter, and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays downhis life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, deserts the sheep, and runs away. So the wolf snatches them and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he is a hired hand, and the sheep do not matter to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay downmy life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must lead these also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock and one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one is taking it from me; I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again. This is a command that I have received from my Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Once again there was a division among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why bother listening to him?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others were saying, “These are not the words of a man who is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now Hanukkah was taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Jesus was walking around in the temple inside the open porch of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the Jews surrounded him and said to him, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so plainly.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them,“I have told you, but you do not believe it. The works that I do in my Father's name testify on my behalf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>What my Father has given me is greater than all else, and no one can snatch it from the Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus replied to them,“I have shown you many good works from myFather. For which of them are you going to stone me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, “We are not going to stone you for a good work but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, are making yourself God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus replied to them,“Is it not written in yourlaw, ‘I said, “You are gods”’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called those to whom the word of God came ‘gods’ (and the Scripture cannot be set aside),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>how can you say to the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I am not doing my Father's works, do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, so that you may know and understandthat the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again they tried to seize him, but he slipped away out of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and he remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Many people came to him and kept saying, “John never performed a sign, but all the things that John said about this man were true!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
