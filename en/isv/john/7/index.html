If you're going to do these things, you should reveal yourself to the world!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For not even his brothers believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus told them,“My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify against it that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go up to the festival yourselves. I am not yetgoing to this festival, for my time has not yet fully come.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After saying this, he remained in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But after his brothers had gone up to the festival, he went up himself, not openly but, as it were, in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews kept looking for him at the festival, saying, “Where is that man?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was a great deal of discussion about him among the crowds.Some were saying, “He is a good man,” while others were saying, “No, he is deceiving the crowd!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one, however, would speak openly about him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Halfway through the festival, Jesus went up to the temple and began teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews were astonished and remarked, “How can this man be so educated when he has never gone to school?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus replied to them,“My teaching is not mine but comes from the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone wants to do his will, he will know whether this teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The one who speaks on his own seeks his own praise. But the one who seeks the praise of him who sent him is true, and there is nothing false in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moses gave you the law, didn't he? Yet none of you is keeping the law. Why are you trying to kill me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The crowd answered, “You have a demon! Who is trying to kill you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered them,“I performed one work, and all of you are astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses gave you circumcision—not that it is from Moses, but from the Patriarchs—and so you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man perfectly well on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Stop judging by appearances, but judge with righteous judgment!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then some of the people of Jerusalem began saying, “This is the man they are trying to kill, isn't it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And look, he is speaking in public, and they are not saying anything to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We know where this man comes from. But when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At this point Jesus, still teaching in the temple, shouted,“So you know me and know where I have come from? I have not come on my own accord. But the one who sent me is true, and he is the one you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know him because I have come from him and he sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>However, many in the crowd believed in him, saying, “When the Christ comes, he won't do more signs than this man has done, will he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the crowd debating these things about him, so the high priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus said,“I will be with you only a little while longer, and then I am going back to the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You will look for me but will not find me.And where I am, you cannot come.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then the Jews said to one another, “Where does this man intend to go so that we will not find him? Surely he's not going to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What does this statement mean that he made,‘You will look for me but will not find me,’ and‘Where I will be, you cannot come’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and shouted,“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to meand drink!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have rivers of living water flowing from his heart.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who were believing in him were to receive. For the Spirit was not yet present, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When they heard these words, some in the crowd were saying, “This really is the Prophet,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>while others were saying, “This is the Christ!”But some were saying, “The Christ doesn't come from Galilee, does he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Doesn't the Scripture say that the Christ is from David's family and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division in the crowd because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the officers returned to the high priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why didn't you bring him?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like that!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the Pharisees replied to them, “You haven't been deceived, too, have you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>None of the authorities or Pharisees has believed in him, has he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this mob that does not know the law—they are accursed!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>One of their number, Nicodemus (the man who had previously gone to him), said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>“Surely our law does not condemn a person without first hearing from him and finding out what he is doing, does it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered him, “You aren't from Galilee, too, are you? Search and see that no prophet comes from Galilee.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then each of them went to his own home.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
