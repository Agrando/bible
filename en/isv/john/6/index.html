But what are they among so many people?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said,“Have the people sit down.” Now there was plenty of grass in that place. So the men sat down, numbering about 5,000.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated. He also distributed the fish, as much as they wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they were completely satisfied, he told his disciples,“Collect the pieces that are left over so that nothing is lost.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the people saw the sign that he had done, they kept saying, “Truly this is the Prophet who was to come into the world!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, withdrew again to the hillside by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. Darkness had already fallen, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A strong wind was blowing, and the sea was getting rough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They had rowed about three or four miles when they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat. They became terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said to them,“It is I. Stop being afraid!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea noticed that only one boat had been there, and no other, and that Jesus had not gotten into that boat with his disciples. Instead, his disciples had gone away by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Other small boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into these boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they had found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus replied to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate the loaves and were completely satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do not work for the food that perishes but for the food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For it is on him that God the Father has set his seal.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they said to him, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered them,“This is the work of God: to believe in the one whom he has sent.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they said to him, “What sign are you going to do so that we may see it and believe in you? What work are you performing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus said to them,“Truly, truly I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then they said to him, “Sir, give us this bread all the time.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to them,“I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never become hungry, and the one who believes in me will never become thirsty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I told you that you have seen me, yet you do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never turn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this is the will of the one who sent me, that I should not lose anything that he has given me, but should raise it to life on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For this is my Father's will, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him to life on the last day.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then the Jews began grumbling about him because he said,“I am the bread that came down from heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They kept saying, “This is Jesus, the son of Joseph, isn't it, whose father and mother we know? So how can he say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered them,“Stop grumbling among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him to life on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the Prophets, ‘And all of them will be taught by God.’Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned anything comes to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who comes from God. This one has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly, truly I tell you, the one who believes in mehas eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that a person may eat it and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, he will live forever. And the bread I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then the Jews debated angrily with each other, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So Jesus told them,“Truly, truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him to life on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my flesh is realfood, and my blood is realdrink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will also live because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread that came down from heaven, not the kind that your ancestors ate. They died, but the one who eats this bread will live forever.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>He said this while teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>When many of his disciples heard this, they said, “This is a difficult statement. Who can accept it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them,“Does this offend you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>What if you saw the Son of Man going up to the place where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is useless. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some among you who do not believe.” For from the beginning Jesus knew those who wouldn't believe, as well as the one who would betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>So he said,“That's why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>As a result, many of his disciples turned back and no longer associated with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>So Jesus said to the twelve,“You don't want to leave, too, do you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Besides, we have believed and remain convinced that you are the Holy One of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus answered them,“I chose you twelve, didn't I? Yet one of you is a devil.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Now he was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For this man, even though he was one of the twelve, was going to betray him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
