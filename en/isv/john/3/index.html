He can't go back into his mother's womb a second time and be born, can he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered,“Truly, truly I tell you, unless a person is born of water and Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whatis born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Don't be astonished that I said to you, ‘All of youmust be born from above.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The windblows where it wants to. You hear its sound, but you don't know where it comes from or where it is going. That's the way it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus said to him, “How can that be?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered him,“You're the teacher of Israel, and you can't understand this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, truly I tell you, we know what we're talking about, and we testify about what we've seen. Yet you peopledo not accept our testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you peopleabout earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>“No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“For this is how God loved the world: He gave his unique Son so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God's unique Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the basis for judgment: The light has come into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light because their actions were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For everyone who practices wickedness hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his actions may not be exposed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that all may seethat his actions have been done in God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside. He spent some time there with them and began baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People kept coming and were being baptized,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>since John had not yet been thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then a controversy about ritual purification sprang up between John's disciples and a certain Jew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They went to John and told him, “Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one about whom you testified—look, he's baptizing, and all are going to him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I have been sent ahead of him.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It is the bridegroom who gets the bride, yet the bridegroom's friend, who merely stands by and listens for him, is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom's voice. That's why this joy of mine is now complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must become more important, but I must become less important.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The one who comes from above is over everything. The one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is over everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He testifies about what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The person who has accepted his testimony has acknowledged that God is truthful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, because God does not give the Spirit in limited measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son and has put everything in his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
