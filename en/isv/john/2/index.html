The mother of Jesus was there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They don't have any wine.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus said to her,“How does that concern us, woman? My hour has not yet come.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother told the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now standing there were six stone water jars used for the Jewish rites of purification, each one holding from twenty to thirty gallons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus told the servants,“Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them up to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to them,“Now draw some out and take it to the man in charge of the banquet.” So they took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the man in charge of the banquet tasted the water that had become wine (without knowing where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called for the bridegroom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said to him, “Everyone serves the best wine first, and the cheap kind when people are drunk. But you have kept the best wine until now!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum—he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples—and they remained there for a few days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Jewish Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, as well as moneychangers sitting at their tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Making a whip out of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, including the sheep and the cattle. He scattered the coins of the moneychangers and knocked over their tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he told those who were selling the doves,“Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father's house a marketplace!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Jews said to him, “What sign can you show us as authority for doing these things?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered them,“Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will rebuild it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jews said, “This sanctuary has been under construction for forty-six years, and you're going to rebuild it in three days?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the sanctuary he was speaking about was his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After he had been raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. So they believed the Scripture and the statement that Jesus had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival, many people believed in his name because they saw the signs that he was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus, however, did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and didn't need anyone to tell him what people were like. For he himself knew what was in every person.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
