She told them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The two of them were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and came to the tomb first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Bending over to look inside, he noticed the linen cloths lying there but didn't go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At this point Simon Peter arrived, following him, and went straight into the tomb. He observed that the linen cloths were lying there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and that the handkerchief that had been on Jesus’ head was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in a separate place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the other disciple, who arrived at the tomb first, went inside, looked, and believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they did not yet understand the Scripture that said that he had to rise from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the disciples went back to their homes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Meanwhile, Mary stood crying outside the tomb. As she cried, she bent over and looked into the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She saw two angels in white clothes who were sitting down, one at the head and the other at the foot of the place where Jesus’ body had been lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?”She told them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have put him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After she had said this, she turned around and noticed Jesus standing there, without realizing that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her,“Woman, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?”Thinking he was the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her,“Mary!”She turned around and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!” (which means “Teacher”).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus told her,“Don't hold on to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” She also told them what he had said to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It was the evening of the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked because they were afraid of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them. He said to them,“Peace be with you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After saying this, he showed them his hands and his side, and when they saw the Lord the disciples were overjoyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to them again,“Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, so I am sending you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them,“Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you forgive people's sins, they are forgiven. If you retain people's sins, they are retained.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called the Twin, wasn't with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the other disciples kept telling him, “We have seen the Lord!”But he told them, “Unless I see the nail marks in his hands, put my finger into them, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A week later his disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were shut, Jesus came, stood among them, and said,“Peace be with you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to Thomas,“Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Take your hand, and put it into my side. Stop doubting, but believe.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thomas answered him, saying “My Lord and my God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to him,“Is it because you have seen me that you have believed? How blessed are those who have never seen me and yet have believed!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not recorded in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that through believing you may have life in his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
