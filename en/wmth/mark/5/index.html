In God's name I implore Thee not to torment me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For He had said to him, »Foul spirit, come out of the man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus also questioned him. »What is your name?« He said. »Legion,« he replied, »for there are a host of us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he earnestly entreated Him not to send them away out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Feeding there, on the mountain slope, was a great herd of swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they besought Jesus. »Send us to the swine,« they said, »so that we may enter into them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He gave them leave; and the foul spirits came out and entered into the swine, and the herd –about 2,000 in number– rushed headlong down the cliff into the Lake and were drowned in the Lake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The swineherds fled, and spread the news in town and country. So the people came to see what it was that had happened;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when they came to Jesus, they beheld the demoniac quietly seated, clothed and of sane mind– the man who had had the legion; and they were awe-stricken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those who had seen it told them the particulars of what had happened to the demoniac, and all about the swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they began entreating Him to depart from their district.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As He was embarking, the man who had been possessed asked permission to accompany Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But He would not allow it. »Go home to your family,« He said, »and report to them all that the Lord has done for you, and the mercy He has shown you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the man departed, and related publicly everywhere in the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had re-crossed in the boat to the other side, a vast multitude came crowding to Him; and He was on the shore of the Lake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>when there came one of the Wardens of the Synagogue –he was called Jair– who, on beholding Him, threw himself at His feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and besought Him with many entreaties. »My little daughter,« he said, »is at the point of death: I pray you come and lay your hands upon her, that she may recover and live.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus went with him. And a dense crowd followed Him, and thronged Him on all sides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now a woman who for twelve years had suffered from haemorrhage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and had undergone many different treatments under a number of doctors and had spent all she had without receiving benefit but on the contrary growing worse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>heard of Jesus. And she came in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for she said, »If I but touch His clothes, I shall be cured.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In a moment the flow of her blood ceased, and she felt in herself that her complaint was cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Immediately Jesus, well knowing that healing power had gone from within Him, turned round in the crowd and asked, »Who touched my clothes?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»You see the multitude pressing you on all sides,« His disciples exclaimed, »and yet you ask, `Who touched me?'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But He continued looking about to see the person who had done this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>until the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself at His feet, and told Him all the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Daughter,« He said, »your faith has cured you: go in peace, and be free from your complaint.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While He is yet speaking, men come from the house to the Warden, and say, »Your daughter is dead: why trouble the Rabbi further?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But Jesus, overhearing the words, said to the Warden, »Do not be afraid; only have faith.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He allowed no one to accompany Him except Peter and the brothers James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So they come to the Warden's house. Here He gazes on a scene of uproar, with people weeping aloud and wailing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He goes in. »Why all this outcry and loud weeping?« He asks; »the child is asleep, not dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>To this their reply is a scornful laugh. He, however, puts them all out, takes the child's father and mother and those He has brought with Him, and enters the room where the child lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then, taking her by the hand, He says to her, »Talitha, koum;« that is to say, »Little girl, I command you to wake!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Instantly the little girl rises to her feet and begins to walk (for she was twelve years old). They were at once beside themselves with utter astonishment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but He gave strict injunctions that the matter should not be made known, and directed them to give her something to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
