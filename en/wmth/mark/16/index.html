They were astonished and terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he said to them, »Do not be terrified. It is Jesus you are looking for–the Nazarene who has been crucified. He has come back to life: He is not here: this is the place where they laid Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go and tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee: and that there you will see Him, as He told you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they came out, and fled from the tomb, for they were greatly agitated and surprised; and they said not a word to any one, for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>[But He rose to life early on the first day of the week, and appeared first to Mary of Magdala from whom He had expelled seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and brought the tidings to those who had been with Him, as they were mourning and weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they, when they were told that He was alive and that she had seen Him, could not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Afterwards He showed Himself in another form to two of them as they were walking, on their way into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These, again, went and told the news to the rest; but not even them did they believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Later still He showed Himself to the Eleven themselves whilst they were at table, and He upbraided them with their unbelief and obstinacy in not having believed those who had seen Him alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then He said to them, »Go the whole world over, and proclaim the Good News to all mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who disbelieves will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And signs shall attend those who believe, even such as these. By making use of my name they shall expel demons. They shall speak new languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They shall take up venomous snakes, and if they drink any deadly poison it shall do them no harm whatever. They shall lay their hands on the sick, and the sick shall recover.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the Lord Jesus after having thus spoken to them was taken up into Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they went out and made proclamation everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming their Message by the signs which accompanied it.]</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
