And many things of that kind you do.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus called the people to Him again. »Listen to me, all of you,« He said, »and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing outside a man which entering him can make him unclean; but it is the things which come out of a man that make him unclean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>After He had left the crowd and gone indoors, His disciples began to ask Him about this figure of speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Have you also so little understanding?« He replied; »do you not understand that anything whatever that enters a man from outside cannot make him unclean,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach, and passes away ejected from him?« By these words Jesus pronounced all kinds of food clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»What comes out of a man,« He added, »that it is which makes him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of men's hearts, their evil purposes proceed–fornication, theft, murder, adultery,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, reviling, pride, reckless folly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>all these wicked things come out from within and make a man unclean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then He rose and left that place and went into the neighbourhood of Tyre and Sidon. Here He entered a house and wished no one to know it, but He could not escape observation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by a foul spirit heard of Him, and came and flung herself at His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She was a Gentile woman, a Syro-phoenician by nation: and again and again she begged Him to expel the demon from her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Let the children first eat all they want,« He said; »it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»True, Sir,« she replied, »and yet the dogs under the table eat the children's scraps.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»For those words of yours, go home,« He replied; »the demon has gone out of your daughter.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So she went home, and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Returning from the neighbourhood of Tyre, He came by way of Sidon to the Lake of Galilee, passing through the district of the Ten Towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Here they brought to Him a deaf man that stammered, on whom they begged Him to lay His hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Jesus taking him aside, apart from the crowd, put His fingers into his ears, and spat, and moistened his tongue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and looking up to Heaven He sighed, and said to him, »Ephphatha!« (that is, »Open!«)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the man's ears were opened, and his tongue became untied, and he began to speak perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus charged them to tell no one; but the more He charged them, all the more did they spread the news far and wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The amazement was extreme. »He succeeds in everything he attempts,« they exclaimed; »he even makes deaf men hear and dumb men speak!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
