Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are–God's Holy One.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus reprimanded him, saying, »Silence! come out of him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the foul spirit, after throwing the man into convulsions, came out of him with a loud cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And all were amazed and awe-struck, so they began to ask one another, »What does this mean? Here is a new sort of teaching–and a tone of authority! And even to foul spirits he issues orders and they obey him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And His fame spread at once everywhere in all that part of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then on leaving the synagogue they came at once, with James and John, to the house of Simon and Andrew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Simon's mother-in-law was ill in bed with a fever, and without delay they informed Him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So He went to her, and taking her hand He raised her to her feet: the fever left her, and she began to wait upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When it was evening, after sunset people came bringing Him all who were sick and the demoniacs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the whole town was assembled at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then He cured numbers of people who were ill with various diseases, and He drove out many demons; not allowing the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In the morning He rose early, while it was still quite dark, and leaving the house He went away to a solitary place and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and the others searched everywhere for Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When they found Him they said, »Every one is looking for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Let us go elsewhere, to the neighbouring country towns,« He replied, »that I may proclaim my Message there also; because for that purpose I came from God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He went through all Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and expelling the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One day there came a leper to Jesus entreating Him, and pleading on his knees. »If you are willing,« he said, »you are able to cleanse me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Moved with pity Jesus reached out His hand and touched him. »I am willing,« He said; »be cleansed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The leprosy at once left him, and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus at once sent him away, strictly charging him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and saying, »Be careful not to tell any one, but go and show yourself to the Priest, and for your purification present the offerings that Moses appointed as evidence for them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But the man, when he went out, began to tell every one and to publish the matter abroad, so that it was no longer possible for Jesus to go openly into any town; but He had to remain outside in unfrequented places, where people came to Him from all parts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
