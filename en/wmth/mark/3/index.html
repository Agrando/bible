But again the crowd assembled, so that there was no opportunity for them even to snatch a meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hearing of this, His relatives came to seize Him by force, for they said, »He is out of his mind.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Scribes, too, who had come down from Jerusalem said, »He has Baal-zebul in him; and it is by the power of the Prince of the demons that he expels the demons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So He called them to Him, and using figurative language He appealed to them, saying, »How is it possible for Satan to expel Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if civil war breaks out in a kingdom, nothing can make that kingdom last;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and if a family splits into parties, that family cannot continue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So if Satan has risen in arms and has made war upon himself, stand he cannot, but meets his end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nay, no one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his property, unless he first binds the strong man, and then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In solemn truth I tell you that all their sins may be pardoned to the sons of men, and all their blasphemies, however they may have blasphemed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, he remains for ever unabsolved: he is guilty of a sin of the Ages.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This was because they said, »He is possessed by a foul spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By this time His mother and His brothers arrive, and standing outside they send a message to Him to call Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now a crowd was sitting round Him; so they tell Him, »Your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, inquiring for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Who are my mother and my brothers?« He replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And, fixing His eyes on the people who were sitting round Him in a circle, He said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Here are my mother and my brothers. For wherever there is one who has been obedient to God, there is my brother –my sister– and my mother.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
