They were untying it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>when some of the bystanders called out, »What are you doing, untying the foal?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But on their giving the answer that Jesus had bidden them give, they let them take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they brought the foal to Jesus, and threw their outer garments over him; and Jesus mounted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then many spread their outer garments to carpet the road, and others leafy branches which they had cut down in the fields;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>while those who led the way and those who followed kept shouting »God save Him!« Blessed be He who comes in the Lord's name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessings on the coming Kingdom of our forefather David! God in the highest Heavens save Him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So He came into Jerusalem and into the Temple; and after looking round upon everything there, the hour being now late He went out to Bethany with the Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The next day, after they had left Bethany, He was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But in the distance He saw a fig-tree in full leaf, and went to see whether perhaps He could find some figs on it. When however He came to it, He found nothing but leaves (for it was not fig time);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and He said to the tree, »Let no one ever again eat fruit from thee!« And His disciples heard this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They reached Jerusalem, and entering the Temple He began to drive out the buyers and sellers, and upset the money-changers' tables and the stools of the pigeon-dealers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and would not allow any one to carry anything through the Temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He remonstrated with them. »Is it not written,« He said, »`My House shall be called The House of Prayer for all the nations?' But you have made it what it now is–a robbers' cave.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This the High Priests and Scribes heard, and they began to devise means to destroy Him. For they were afraid of Him, because of the deep impression produced on all the people by His teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When evening came on, Jesus and His disciples used to leave the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In the early morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree withered to the roots;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and Peter, recollecting, said to Him, »Look, Rabbi, the fig-tree which you cursed is withered up.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to them, »Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall say to this mountain, `Remove, and hurl thyself into the sea,' and has no doubt about it in his heart, but stedfastly believes that what he says will happen, it shall be granted him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That is why I tell you, as to whatever you pray and make request for, if you believe that you have received it it shall be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But whenever you stand praying, if you have a grievance against any one, forgive it, so that your Father in Heaven may also forgive you your offences.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They came again to Jerusalem; and as He was walking in the Temple, the High Priests, Scribes and Elders came to Him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and asked, »By what authority are you doing these things? and who gave you authority to do them?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»And I will put a question to you,« replied Jesus; »answer me, and then I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>John's Baptism–was it of Heavenly or of human origin? Answer me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So they debated the matter with one another. »Suppose we say, `Heavenly,'« they argued, »he will ask, `Why then did you not believe him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Or should we say, `human?'« They were afraid of the people; for all agreed in holding John to have been really a Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they answered Jesus, »We do not know.«»Nor do I tell you,« said Jesus, »by what authority I do these things.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
