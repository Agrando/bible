And what are these marvellous miracles which his hands perform?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is not this the carpenter, Mary's son, the brother of James and Joses, Jude and Simon? And do not his sisters live here among us?« So they turned angrily away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus said to them, »There is no Prophet without honour except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He could not do any miracle there, except that He laid His hands on a few who were out of health and cured them; and</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He wondered at their unbelief. So He went round the adjacent villages, teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then summoning the Twelve to Him, He proceeded to send them out by twos, and gave them authority over the foul spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He charged them to take nothing for the journey except a stick; no bread, no bag, and not a penny in their pockets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but to go wearing sandals. »And do not,« He said, »put on an extra under garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Wherever you enter a house, make it your home till you leave that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But wherever they will not receive you or listen to you, when you leave shake off the very dust from under your feet to bear witness concerning them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they set out, and preached in order that men might repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Many demons they expelled, and many invalids they anointed with oil and cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>King Herod heard of all this (for the name of Jesus had become widely known), and he kept saying, »John the Baptizer has come back to life, and that is why these miraculous Powers are working in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others asserted that He was Elijah. Others again said, »He is a Prophet, like one of the great Prophets.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard of Him, he said, »The John, whom I beheaded, has come back to life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent and had had John arrested and had kept him in prison in chains, for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John had repeatedly told Herod, »You have no right to be living with your brother's wife.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Herodias hated him and wished to take his life, but could not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for Herod stood in awe of John, knowing him to be an upright and holy man, and he protected him. After listening to him he was in great perplexity, and yet he found a pleasure in listening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>At length Herodias found her opportunity. Herod on his birthday gave a banquet to the nobles of his court and to the tribunes and the principal people in Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>at which Herodias's own daughter came in and danced, and so charmed Herod and his guests that he said to her, »Ask me for anything you please, and I will give it to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He even swore to her, »Whatever you ask me for I will give you, up to half my kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>She at once went out and said to her mother:»What shall I ask for?«»The head of John the Baptizer,« she replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The girl immediately came in, in haste, to the King and made her request. »My desire is,« she said, »that you will give me, here and now, on a dish, the head of John the Baptist.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the King, though intensely sorry, yet for the sake of his oaths, and of his guests, would not break faith with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He at once sent a soldier of his guard with orders to bring John's head. So he went and beheaded him in the prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and brought his head on a dish and gave it to the young girl, who gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When John's disciples heard of it, they came and took away his body and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When the Apostles had re-assembled round Jesus, they reported to Him all they had done and all they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then He said to them, »Come away, all of you, to a quiet place, and rest awhile.« For there were many coming and going, so that they had no time even for meals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Accordingly they sailed away in the boat to a solitary place apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the people saw them going, and many knew them; and coming by land they ran together there from all the neighbouring towns, and arrived before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So when Jesus landed, He saw a vast multitude; and His heart was moved with pity for them, because they were like sheep which have no shepherd, and He proceeded to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this time it was late; so His disciples came to Him, and said, »This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>send them away that they may go to the farms and villages near here and buy themselves something to eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Give them food yourselves,« He replied. »Are we,« they asked, `to go and buy two hundred shillings' worth of bread and give them food?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»How many loaves have you?« He inquired; »go and see.« So they found out, and said, »Five; and a couple of fish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So He directed them to make all sit down in companies on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they sat down in rows of hundreds and of fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and lifting His eyes to Heaven He blessed the food. Then He broke the loaves into portions which He went on handing to the disciples to distribute; giving pieces also of the two fish to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All ate and were fully satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they carried away broken portions enough to fill twelve baskets, besides pieces of the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Those who ate the bread were 5,000 adult men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Immediately afterwards He made His disciples go on board the boat and cross over to Bethsaida, leaving Him behind to dismiss the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He then bade the people farewell, and went away up the hill to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When evening was come, the boat was half way across the Lake, while he Himself was on shore alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But when He saw them distressed with rowing (for the wind was against them), towards morning He came towards them walking on the Lake, as if intending to pass them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>They saw Him walking on the water, and thinking that it was a spirit they cried out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>for they all saw Him and were terrified. He, however, immediately spoke to them. »There is no danger,« He said; »it is I; be not alarmed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then He went up to them on board the boat, and the wind lulled; and they were beside themselves with silent amazement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For they had not learned the lesson taught by the loaves, but their minds were dull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Having crossed over they drew to land in Gennesaret and came to anchor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But no sooner had they gone ashore than the people immediately recognized Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Then they scoured the whole district, and began to bring Him the sick on their mats wherever they heard He was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And enter wherever He might –village or town or hamlet– they laid their sick in the open places, and entreated Him to let them touch were it but the tassel of His robe; and all, whoever touched Him, were restored to health.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
