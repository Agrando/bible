Jesus, however, said again, »Children, how hard a struggle is it for those who trust in riches to enter the Kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They were astonished beyond measure, and said to one another, »Who then can be saved?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus looking on them said, »With men it is impossible, but not with God; for everything is possible with God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Remember,« said Peter to Him, »that we forsook everything and have become your followers.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»In solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that there is no one who has forsaken house or brothers or sisters, or mother or father, or children or lands, for my sake and for the sake of the Good News,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but will receive a hundred times as much now in this present life –houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, lands– and persecution with them–and in the coming age the Life of the Ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many who are now first will be last, and the last, first.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They were still on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them; they were full of wonder, and some, though they followed, did so with fear. Then, once more calling to Him the Twelve, He began to tell them what was about to happen to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»See,« He said, »we are going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and the Scribes. They will condemn Him to death, and will hand Him over to the Gentiles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they will insult Him in cruel sport, spit on Him, scourge Him, and put Him to death; but on the third day He will rise to life again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then James and John, the sons of Zabdi, came up to Him and said, »Rabbi, we wish you would grant us whatever request we make of you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»What would you have me do for you?« He asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Allow us,« they replied, »to sit one at your right hand and the other at your left hand, in your glory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»You know not,« said He, »what you are asking. Are you able to drink out of the cup from which I am to drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am to be baptized?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»We are able,« they replied. »Out of the cup,« said Jesus, »from which I am to drink you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I am to be baptized you shall be baptized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but as to sitting at my right hand or at my left, that is not mine to give: it will be for those for whom it is reserved.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The other ten, hearing of it, were at first highly indignant with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus, however, called them to Him and said to them, »You are aware how those who are deemed rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men make them feel their authority;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but it is not to be so among you. No, whoever desires to be great among you must be your servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever desires to be first among you must be the bondservant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For the Son of Man also did not come to be waited upon, but to wait on others, and to give His life as the redemption-price for a multitude of people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>They came to Jericho; and as He was leaving that town –Himself and His disciples and a great crowd– Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus), a blind beggar, was sitting by the way-side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, »Son of David, Jesus, have pity on me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Many angrily told him to leave off shouting; but he only cried out all the louder, »Son of David, have pity on me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then Jesus stood still. »Call him,« He said. So they called the blind man. »Cheer up,« they said; »rise, he is calling you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>The man flung away his outer garment, sprang to his feet, and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»What shall I do for you?« said Jesus. »Rabboni,« replied the blind man, »let me recover my sight.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>»Go,« said Jesus, »your faith has cured you.« Instantly he regained his sight, and followed Him along the road.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
