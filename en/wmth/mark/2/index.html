He was speaking His Message to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>when there came a party of people bringing a paralytic–four men carrying him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Finding themselves unable, however, to bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they untiled the roof just over His head, and after clearing an opening they lowered the mat on which the paralytic was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, »My son, your sins are pardoned.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were some of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Why does this man use such words?« they said; »he is blaspheming. Who can pardon sins but One–that is, God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>At once perceiving by His spirit that they were reasoning within themselves, Jesus asked them, »Why do you thus argue in your minds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier?–to say to this paralytic, `Your sins are pardoned,' or to say, `Rise, take up your mat, and walk?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins« –He turned to the paralytic, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»To you I say, `Rise, take up your mat and go home.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The man rose, and immediately under the eyes of all took up his mat and went out, so that they were all filled with astonishment, gave the glory to God, and said, »We never saw anything like this.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Again He went out to the shore of the Lake, and the whole multitude kept coming to Him, and He taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the Toll Office, and said to him, »Follow me.« So he rose and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When He was sitting at table in Levi's house, a large number of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners were at table with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many such who habitually followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when the Scribes of the Pharisee sect saw Him eating with the sinners and the tax-gatherers, they said to His disciples, »He is eating and drinking with the tax-gatherers and sinners!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus heard the words, and He said, »It is not the healthy who require a doctor, but the sick: I did not come to appeal to the righteous, but to sinners.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now John's disciples and those of the Pharisees were keeping a fast.) And they came and asked Him, »How is it that John's disciples and those of the Pharisees are fasting, and yours are not?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Can a wedding party fast while the bridegroom is among them?« replied Jesus. »So long as they have the bridegroom with them, fasting is impossible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But a time will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No one mends an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth. Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away from it– the new from the old– and a worse hole would be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise the wine would burst the skins, and both wine and skins would be lost. New wine needs fresh skins!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One Sabbath He was walking through the wheatfields when His disciples began to pluck the ears of wheat as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the Pharisees said to Him, »Look! why are they doing what on the Sabbath is unlawful?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Have you never read,« Jesus replied, »what David did when the necessity arose and he and his men were hungry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>how he entered the house of God in the High-priesthood of Abiathar, and ate the Presented Loaves –which none but the priests are allowed to eat– and gave some to his men also?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus said to them: »The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
