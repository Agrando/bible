There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These miseries are but like the early pains of childbirth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»You yourselves must be on your guard. They will deliver you up to Sanhedrins; you will be brought into synagogues and cruelly beaten; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to be witnesses to them for me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the proclamation of the Good News must be carried to all the Gentiles before the End comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When however they are marching you along under arrest, do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say, but speak what is given you when the time comes; for it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Brother will betray brother to be killed, and fathers will betray children; and children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You will be objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name, but those who stand firm to the End will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»As soon, however, as you see the Abomination of Desolation standing where he ought not« –let the reader observe these words– then let those in Judaea escape to the hills;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>let him who is on the roof not come down and enter the house to fetch anything out of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and let not him who is in the field turn back to pick up his outer garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And alas for the women who at that time are with child or have infants!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»But pray that it may not come in the winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For those will be times of suffering the like of which has never been from the first creation of God's world until now, and assuredly never will be again;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and but for the fact that the Lord has cut short those days, no one would escape; but for the sake of His own People whom He has chosen for Himself He has cut short the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»At that time if any one says to you, `See, here is the Christ!' or `See, He is there!' do not believe it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets, displaying signs and prodigies with a view to lead astray –if indeed that were possible– even God's own People.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But as for yourselves, be on your guard: I have forewarned you of everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»At that time, however, after that distress, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shed her light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the stars will be seen falling from the firmament, and the forces which are in the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then will they see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He will send forth the angels and gather together His chosen People from north, south, east and west, from the remotest parts of the earth and the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Learn from the fig-tree the lesson it teaches. As soon as its branch has become soft and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So also do you, when you see these things happening, be sure that He is near, at your very door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»But as to that day or the exact time no one knows–not even the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Take care, be on the alert, and pray; for you do not know when it will happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>It is like a man living abroad who has left his house, and given the management to his servants –to each one his special duty– and has ordered the porter to keep awake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Be wakeful therefore, for you know not when the master of the house is coming–in the evening, at midnight, at cock-crow, or at dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Beware lest He should arrive unexpectedly and find you asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Moreover, what I say to you I say to all–Be wakeful!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
