It pierces even to the severance of soul from spirit, and penetrates between the joints and the marrow, and it can discern the secret thoughts and purposes of the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And no created thing is able to escape its scrutiny; but everything lies bare and completely exposed before the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Inasmuch, then, as we have in Jesus, the Son of God, a great High Priest who has passed into Heaven itself, let us hold firmly to our profession of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we have not a High Priest who is unable to feel for us in our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in every respect just as we are tempted, and yet did not sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our times of need.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
