for this latter thing He did once for all when He offered up Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the Law constitutes men High Priests –men with all their infirmity– but the utterance of the oath, which came later than the Law, constitutes High Priest a Son who has been made for ever perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
