They had not received the promised blessings, but had seen them from a distance and had greeted them, and had acknowledged themselves to be foreigners and strangers here on earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for men who acknowledge this make it manifest that they are seeking elsewhere a country of their own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if they had cherished the remembrance of the country they had left, they would have found an opportunity to return;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but, as it is, we see them eager for a better land, that is to say, a heavenly one. For this reason God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has now prepared a city for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Through faith Abraham, as soon as God put him to the test, offered up Isaac. Yes, he who had joyfully welcomed the promises was on the point of sacrificing his only son</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>with regard to whom he had been told, »It is through Isaac that your posterity shall be traced.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he reckoned that God is even able to raise a man up from among the dead, and, figuratively speaking, it was from among the dead that he received Isaac again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Through faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even in connexion with things soon to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Through faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons, and, leaning on the top of his staff, worshipped God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Through faith Joseph, when he was near his end, made mention of the departure of the descendants of Israel, and gave orders about his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Through faith the child Moses was hid for three months by his parents, because they saw his rare beauty; and the king's edict had no terror for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Through faith Moses, when he grew to manhood, refused to be known as Pharaoh's daughter's son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>having determined to endure ill-treatment along with the people of God rather than enjoy the short-lived pleasures of sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>because he deemed the reproaches which he might meet with in the service of the Christ to be greater riches than all the treasures of Egypt; for he fixed his gaze on the coming reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Through faith he left Egypt, not being frightened by the king's anger; for he held on his course as seeing the unseen One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Through faith he instituted the Passover, and the sprinkling with blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch the Israelites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Through faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing over dry land, but the Egyptians, when they tried to do the same, were swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Through faith the walls of Jericho fell to the ground after being surrounded for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Through faith the notorious sinner Rahab did not perish along with the disobedient, for she had welcomed the spies and had sheltered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And why need I say more? For time will fail me if I tell the story of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, and of David and Samuel and the Prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>men who, as the result of faith, conquered whole kingdoms, brought about true justice, obtained promises from God, stopped lions' mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>deprived fire of its power, escaped being killed by the sword, out of weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put to flight foreign armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received back their dear ones alive from the dead; and others were put to death with torture, refusing the deliverance offered to them–that they might secure a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Others again were tested by cruel mockery and by scourging; yes, and by chains and imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried by temptation, they were killed with the sword. They went from place to place in sheepskins or goatskins, enduring want, oppression and cruelty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>(They were men of whom the world was not worthy.) They wandered across deserts and mountains, or hid themselves in caves and in holes in the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And although by their faith all these people won God's approval, none of them received the fulfilment of His great promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>for God had provided for them and us something better, so that apart from us they were not to attain to full blessedness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
