for when He had said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»`This is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days,' says the Lord: `I will put My laws upon their hearts and will write them on their minds;'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He adds, »And their sins and offences I will remember no longer.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But where these have been forgiven no further offering for sin is required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Since then, brethren, we have free access to the Holy place through the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by the new and ever-living way which He opened up for us through the rending of the veil –that is to say, of His earthly nature–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and since we have a great Priest who has authority over the house of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us draw near with sincerity and unfaltering faith, having had our hearts sprinkled, once for all, from consciences oppressed with sin, and our bodies bathed in pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold firmly to an unflinching avowal of our hope, for He is faithful who gave us the promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let us bestow thought on one another with a view to arousing one another to brotherly love and right conduct;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not neglecting –as some habitually do– to meet together, but encouraging one another, and doing this all the more since you can see the day of Christ approaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we wilfully persist in sin after having received the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains in reserve any other sacrifice for sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>There remains nothing but a certain awful expectation of judgement, and the fury of a fire which before long will devour the enemies of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Any one who bids defiance to the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>How much severer punishment, think you, will he be held to deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, has not regarded as holy that Covenant-blood with which he was set free from sin, and has insulted the Spirit from whom comes grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know who it is that has said, »Vengeance belongs to Me: I will pay back;« and again, »The Lord will be His people's judge.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is an awful thing to fall into the hands of the ever-living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But continually recall to mind the days now past, when on being first enlightened you went through a great conflict and many sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>This was partly through allowing yourselves to be made a public spectacle amid reproaches and persecutions, and partly through coming forward to share the sufferings of those who were thus treated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For you not only showed sympathy with those who were imprisoned, but you even submitted with joy when your property was taken from you, being well aware that you have in your own selves a more valuable possession and one which will remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore do not cast from you your confident hope, for it will receive a vast reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For you stand in need of patient endurance, so that, as the result of having done the will of God, you may receive the promised blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For there is still but a short time and then »The coming One will come and will not delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But it is by faith that My righteous servant shall live; and if he shrinks back, My soul takes no pleasure in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not people who shrink back and perish, but are among those who believe and gain possession of their souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
