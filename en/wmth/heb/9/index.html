But I cannot now speak about all these in detail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These arrangements having long been completed, the priests, when conducting the divine services, continually enter the outer tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But into the second, the High Priest goes only on one day of the year, and goes alone, taking with him blood, which he offers on his own behalf and on account of the sins which the people have ignorantly committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the lesson which the Holy Spirit teaches is this–that the way into the true Holy place is not yet open so long as the outer tent still remains in existence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And this is a figure –for the time now present– answering to which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, unable though they are to give complete freedom from sin to him who ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For their efficacy depends only on meats and drinks and various washings, ceremonies pertaining to the body and imposed until a time of reformation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Christ appeared as a High Priest of the blessings that are soon to come by means of the greater and more perfect Tent of worship, a tent which has not been built with hands –that is to say does not belong to this material creation–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and once for all entered the Holy place, taking with Him not the blood of goats and calves, but His own blood, and thus procuring eternal redemption for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have contracted defilement make them holy so as to bring about ceremonial purity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>how much more certainly shall the blood of Christ, who strengthened by the eternal Spirit offered Himself to God, free from blemish, purify your consciences from lifeless works for you to serve the ever-living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And because of this He is the negotiator of a new Covenant, in order that, since a life has been given in atonement for the offences committed under the first Covenant, those who have been called may receive the eternal inheritance which has been promised to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where there is a legal `will,' there must also be a death brought forward in evidence–the death of him who made it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And a will is only of force in the case of a deceased person, being never of any avail so long as he who made it lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Accordingly we find that the first Covenant was not inaugurated without blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For when Moses had proclaimed to all the people every commandment contained in the Law, he took the blood of the calves and of the goats and with them water, scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, »This is the blood which confirms the Covenant that God has made binding upon you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in the same way he also sprinkled blood upon the Tent of worship and upon all the vessels used in the ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Indeed we may almost say that in obedience to the Law everything is sprinkled with blood, and that apart from the outpouring of blood there is no remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It was needful therefore that the copies of the things in Heaven should be cleansed in this way, but that the heavenly things themselves should be cleansed with more costly sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For not into a Holy place built by men's hands –a mere copy of the reality– did Christ enter, but He entered Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nor did He enter for the purpose of many times offering Himself in sacrifice, just as the High Priest enters the Holy place, year after year, taking with him blood not his own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that case Christ would have needed to suffer many times, from the creation of the world onwards; but as a matter of fact He has appeared once for all, at the Close of the Ages, in order to do away with sin by the sacrifice of Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And since it is reserved for all mankind once to die, and afterwards to be judged;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so the Christ also, having been once offered in sacrifice in order that He might bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, separated from sin, to those who are eagerly expecting Him, to make their salvation complete.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
