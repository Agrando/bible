Was it not the whole of the people who had come out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And with whom was God so greatly grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, and whose dead bodies fell in the Desert?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to whom did He swear that they should not be admitted to His rest, if it was not to those who were disobedient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And so we see that it was owing to lack of faith that they could not be admitted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
