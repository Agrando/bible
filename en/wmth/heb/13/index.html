Be content with what you have; for God Himself has said, »I will never, never let go your hand: I will never never forsake you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So that we fearlessly say, »The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid: what can man do to me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember your former leaders–it was they who brought you God's Message. Bear in mind how they ended their lives, and imitate their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day–yes, and to the ages to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not be drawn aside by all sorts of strange teaching; for it is well to have the heart made stedfast through God's grace, and not by special kinds of food, from which those who scrupulously attend to them have derived no benefit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We Christians have an altar from which the ministers of the Jewish Tent have no right to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the bodies of those animals of which the blood is carried by the High Priest into the Holy place as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And for this reason Jesus also, in order, by His own blood, to set the people free from sin, suffered outside the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let us go to Him outside the camp, sharing the insults directed against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we have no permanent city here, but we are longing for the city which is soon to be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Through Him, then, let us continually lay on the altar a sacrifice of praise to God, namely, the utterance of lips that give thanks to His Name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And do not forget to be kind and liberal; for with sacrifices of that sort God is greatly pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Obey your leaders and be submissive to them. For they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will have to give account; that they may do this with joy and not with lamentation. For that would be of no advantage to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Keep on praying for us; for we are sure that we have clear consciences, and we desire to live nobly in every respect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I specially urge this upon you in order that I may be the more speedily restored to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now may God who gives peace, and brought Jesus, our Lord, up again from among the dead –even Him who, by virtue of the blood of the eternal Covenant, is the great Shepherd of the sheep–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>fully equip you with every grace that you may need for the doing of His will, producing in us that which will truly please Him through Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory to the Ages of the Ages! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Bear with me, brethren, when I thus exhort you; for, in fact, it is but a short letter that I have written to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You will rejoice to hear that our brother Timothy has been set at liberty. If he comes soon, I will see you with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Greet all your leaders and all God's people. The brethren from Italy send you greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Grace be with you all! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
