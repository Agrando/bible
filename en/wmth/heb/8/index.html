Therefore this High Priest also must have some offering to present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If then He were still on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since here there are already those who present the offerings in obedience to the Law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and serve a copy and type of the heavenly things, just as Moses was divinely instructed when about to build the tabernacle. For God said, »See that you make everything in imitation of the pattern shown you on the mountain.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But, as a matter of fact, the ministry which Christ has obtained is all the nobler a ministry, in that He is at the same time the negotiator of a sublimer covenant, based upon sublimer promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if that first Covenant had been free from imperfection, there would have been no attempt to introduce another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For, being dissatisfied with His people, God says, »`There are days coming,' says the Lord, `When I will establish with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new Covenant–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>a Covenant unlike the one which I made with their forefathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out from the land of Egypt; for they would not remain faithful to that.' `So I turned from them,' says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`But this is the Covenant that I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days,' says the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds and will write them upon their hearts. And I will indeed be their God and they shall be My People.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there shall be no need for them to teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, Know the Lord. For all will know Me from the least of them to the greatest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because I will be merciful to their wrongdoings, and their sins I will remember no longer.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By using the words, »a new Covenant,« He has made the first one obsolete; but whatever is decaying and showing signs of old age is not far from disappearing altogether.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
