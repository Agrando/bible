for my doing this helps forward your own intentions, seeing that not only have you begun operations, but a year ago you already had the desire to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now complete the doing also, in order that, just as there was then the eagerness in desiring, there may now be the accomplishment in proportion to your means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For, assuming the earnest willingness, the gift is acceptable according to whatever a man has, and not according to what he has not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I do not urge you to give in order that others may have relief while you are unduly pressed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but that, by equalization of burdens, your superfluity having in the present emergency supplied their deficiency, their superfluity may in turn be a supply for your deficiency later on, so that there may be equalization of burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Even as it is written, »He who gathered much had not too much, and he who gathered little had not too little.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But thanks be to God that He inspires the heart of Titus with the same deep interest in you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for Titus welcomed our request, and, being thoroughly in earnest, comes to you of his own free will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we send with him the brother whose praises for his earnestness in proclaiming the Good News are heard throughout all the Churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And more than that, he is the one who was chosen by the vote of the Churches to travel with us, sharing our commission in the administration of this generous gift to promote the Lord's glory and gratify our own strong desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For against one thing we are on our guard–I mean against blame being thrown upon us in respect to these large and liberal contributions which are under our charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For we seek not only God's approval of our integrity, but man's also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we send with them our brother, of whose zeal we have had frequent proof in many matters, and who is now more zealous than ever through the strong confidence which he has in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As for Titus, remember that he is a partner with me, and is my comrade in my labours for you. And as for our brethren, remember that they are delegates from the Churches, and are men in whom Christ is glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Exhibit therefore to the Churches a proof of your love, and a justification of our boasting to these brethren about you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
