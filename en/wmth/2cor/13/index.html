We also are weak, sharing His weakness, but with Him we shall be full of life to deal with you through the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Test yourselves to discover whether you are true believers: put your own selves under examination.

This we also pray for–the perfecting of your characters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this reason I write thus while absent, that when present I may not have to act severely in the exercise of the authority which the Lord has given me for building up, and not for pulling down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Finally, brethren, be joyful, secure perfection of character, take courage, be of one mind, live in peace.
