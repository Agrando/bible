If any man is confident as regards himself that he specially belongs to Christ, let him consider again and reflect that just as he belongs to Christ, so also do we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If, however, I were to boast more loudly of our Apostolic authority, which the Lord has given us that we may build you up, not pull you down, I should have no reason to feel ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let it not seem as if I wanted to frighten you by my letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they say »His letters are authoritative and forcible, but his personal presence is unimpressive, and as for eloquence, he has none.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such people take this into their reckoning, that whatever we are in word by our letters when absent, the same are we also in act when present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we have not the `courage' to rank ourselves among, or compare ourselves with, certain persons distinguished by their self-commendation. Yet they are not wise, measuring themselves, as they do, by one another and comparing themselves with one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We, however, will not exceed due limits in our boasting, but will keep within the limits of the sphere which God has assigned to us as a limit, which reaches even to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For there is no undue stretch of authority on our part, as though it did not extend to you. We pressed on even to Corinth, and were the first to proclaim to you the Good News of the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We do not exceed our due limits, and take credit for other men's labours; but we entertain the hope that, as your faith grows, we shall gain promotion among you –still keeping within our own sphere– promotion to a larger field of labour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and shall tell the Good News in the districts beyond you, not boasting in another man's sphere about work already done by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But »whoever boasts, let his boast be in the Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For it is not the man that commends himself who is really approved, but he whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
