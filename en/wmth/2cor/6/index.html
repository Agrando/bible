Now is the day of salvation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We endeavour to give people no cause for stumbling in anything, lest the work we are doing should fall into discredit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>On the contrary, as God's servants, we seek their full approval–by unwearied endurance, by afflictions, by distress, by helplessness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>by floggings, by imprisonments; by facing riots, by toil, by sleepless watching, by hunger and thirst;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>by purity of life, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>by the proclamation of the truth, by the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness, wielded in both hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>through honour and ignominy, through calumny and praise. We are looked upon as impostors and yet are true men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>as obscure persons, and yet are well known; as on the point of death, and yet, strange to tell, we live; as under God's discipline, and yet we are not deprived of life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as sad, but we are always joyful; as poor, but we bestow wealth on many; as having nothing, and yet we securely possess all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O Corinthians, our lips are unsealed to you: our heart is expanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is no narrowness in our love to you: the narrowness is in your own feelings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in just requital –I speak as to my children– let your hearts expand also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Do not come into close association with unbelievers, like oxen yoked with asses. For what is there in common between righteousness and lawlessness? Or what partnership has light with darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where can harmony between Christ and Belial be found? Or what participation has a believer with an unbeliever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And what compact has the Temple of God with idols? For we are the Temple of the ever-living God; as God has said, »I will dwell among them, and walk about among them; and will be their God, and it is they who shall be My people.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, »`Come out from among them and separate yourselves,' says the Lord, `and touch nothing impure; and I will receive you, and will be a Father to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and you shall be My sons and daughters,' says the Lord the Ruler of all.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
