Then my plan was to return from Macedonia to you, and be helped forward by you to Judaea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I display any vacillation or caprice in this? Or the purposes which I form–do I form them on worldly principles, now crying »Yes, yes,« and now »No, no«?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As certainly as God is faithful, our language to you is not now »Yes« and now »No.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For Jesus Christ the Son of God –He who was proclaimed among you by us, that is by Silas and Timothy and myself– did not show Himself a waverer between »Yes« and »No.« But it was and always is »Yes« with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For all the promises of God, whatever their number, have their confirmation in Him; and for this reason through Him also our »Amen« acknowledges their truth and promotes the glory of God through our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But He who is making us as well as you stedfast through union with the Anointed One, and has anointed us, is God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and He has also set His seal upon us, and has put His Spirit into our hearts as a pledge and foretaste of future blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But as for me, as my soul shall answer for it, I appeal to God as my witness, that it was to spare you pain that I gave up my visit to Corinth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not that we want to lord it over you in respect of your faith –we do, however, desire to help your joy– for in the matter of your faith you are standing firm.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
