Just as the Lord has forgiven you, you also must forgive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And over all these put on love, which is the perfect bond of union;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and let the peace which Christ gives settle all questionings in your hearts, to which peace indeed you were called as belonging to His one Body; and be thankful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let the teaching concerning Christ remain as a rich treasure in your hearts. In all wisdom teach and admonish one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and sing with grace in your hearts to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, and let it be through Him that you give thanks to God the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Married women, be submissive to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Married men, be affectionate to your wives, and do not treat them harshly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Children be obedient to your parents in everything; for that is right for Christians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fathers, do not fret and harass your children, or you may make them sullen and morose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Slaves, be obedient in everything to your earthly masters; not in acts of eye service, as aiming only to please men, but with simplicity of purpose, because you fear the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whatever you are doing, let your hearts be in your work, as a thing done for the Lord and not for men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For you know that it is from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. Christ is the Master whose bondservants you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The man who perpetrates a wrong will find the wrong repaid to him; and with God there are no merely earthly distinctions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
