And how are they to believe in One whose voice they have never heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how are men to preach unless they have been sent to do so? As it is written, »How beautiful are the feet of those who bring glad tidings of good!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But, some will say, they have not all hearkened to the Good News. No, for Isaiah asks, »Lord, who has believed the Message they have heard from us?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this proves that faith comes from a Message heard, and that the Message comes through its having been spoken by Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, I ask, have they not heard? Yes, indeed: »To the whole world the preachers' voices have sounded forth, and their words to the remotest parts of the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But again, did Israel fail to understand? Listen to Moses first. He says, »I will fire you with jealousy against a nation which is no nation, and with fury against a nation devoid of understanding.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaiah, with strange boldness, exclaims, »I have been found by those who were not looking for Me, I have revealed Myself to those who were not inquiring of Me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>While as to Israel he says, »All day long I have stretched out My arms to a self-willed and fault-finding people.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
