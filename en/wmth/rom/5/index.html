This comparison. Through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin death, and so death passed to all mankind in turn, in that all sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For prior to the Law sin was already in the world; only it is not entered in the account against us when no Law exists.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet Death reigned as king from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned, as Adam did, against Law. And in Adam we have a type of Him whose coming was still future.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But God's free gift immeasurably outweighs the transgression. For if through the transgression of the one individual the mass of mankind have died, infinitely greater is the generosity with which God's grace, and the gift given in His grace which found expression in the one man Jesus Christ, have been bestowed on the mass of mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it is not with the gift as it was with the results of one individual's sin; for the judgement which one individual provoked resulted in condemnation, whereas the free gift after a multitude of transgressions results in acquittal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if, through the transgression of the one individual, Death made use of the one individual to seize the sovereignty, all the more shall those who receive God's overflowing grace and gift of righteousness reign as kings in Life through the one individual, Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It follows then that just as the result of a single transgression is a condemnation which extends to the whole race, so also the result of a single decree of righteousness is a life-giving acquittal which extends to the whole race.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as through the disobedience of the one individual the mass of mankind were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One the mass of mankind will be constituted righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Law was brought in later on, so that transgression might increase. But where sin increased, grace has overflowed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>in order that as sin has exercised kingly sway in inflicting death, so grace, too, may exercise kingly sway in bestowing a righteousness which results in the Life of the Ages through Jesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
