Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I marvel that you are so readily leaving Him who called you by the grace of Christ, and are adhering to a different Good News.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For other »Good News« there is none; but there are some persons who are troubling you, and are seeking to distort the Good News concerning Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if even we or an angel from Heaven should bring you a Good News different from that which we have already brought you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What I have just said I repeat–if any one is preaching to you a Good News other than that which you originally received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For is it man's favour or God's that I aspire to? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still a man-pleaser, I should not be Christ's bondservant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I must tell you, brethren, that the Good News which was proclaimed by me is not such as man approves of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For, in fact, it was not from man that I received or learnt it, but by a revelation from Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my early career in Judaism–how I furiously persecuted the Church of God, and made havoc of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and how in devotion to Judaism I outstripped many men of my own age among my people, being far more zealous than they on behalf of the traditions of my forefathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when He who set me apart even from my birth, and called me by His grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saw fit to reveal His Son within me in order that I might tell among the Gentiles the Good News concerning Him, at once I did not confer with any human being,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were my seniors in the Apostleship, but I went away into Arabia, and afterwards came back to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then, three years later, I went up to Jerusalem to inquire for Peter, and I spent a fortnight with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I saw none of the other Apostles, except James, the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In making these assertions I am speaking the truth, as in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Afterwards I visited Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But to the Christian Churches in Judaea I was personally unknown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They only heard it said, »He who was once our persecutor is now telling the Good News of the faith of which he formerly made havoc.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they gave glory to God on my account.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
