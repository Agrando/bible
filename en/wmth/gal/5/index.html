Who has interfered and caused you to swerve from the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>No such teaching ever proceeded from Him who is calling you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little yeast corrupts the whole of the dough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For my part I have strong confidence in you in the Lord that you will adopt my view of the matter. But the man –be he who he may– who is troubling you, will have to bear the full weight of the judgement to be pronounced on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As for me, brethren, if I am still a preacher of circumcision, how is it that I am still suffering persecution? In that case the Cross has ceased to be a stumbling-block!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Would to God that those who are unsettling your faith would even mutilate themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You however, brethren, were called to freedom. Only do not turn your freedom into an excuse for giving way to your lower natures; but become bondservants to one another in a spirit of love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the entire Law has been obeyed when you have kept the single precept, which says, »You are to love your fellow man equally with yourself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you are perpetually snarling and snapping at one another, beware lest you are destroyed by one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This then is what I mean. Let your lives be guided by the Spirit, and then you will certainly not indulge the cravings of your lower natures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the cravings of the lower nature are opposed to those of the Spirit, and the cravings of the Spirit are opposed to those of the lower nature; because these are antagonistic to each other, so that you cannot do everything to which you are inclined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if the Spirit is leading you, you are not subject to Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now you know full well the doings of our lower natures. Fornication, impurity, indecency, idol-worship, sorcery;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of passion, intrigues, dissensions, factions, envyings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>hard drinking, riotous feasting, and the like. And as to these I forewarn you, as I have already forewarned you, that those who are guilty of such things will have no share in the Kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Spirit, on the other hand, brings a harvest of love, joy, peace; patience towards others, kindness, benevolence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>good faith, meekness, self-restraint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Against such things as these there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their lower nature with its passions and appetites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we are living by the Spirit's power, let our conduct also be governed by the Spirit's power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not become vain-glorious, challenging one another, envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
