In no respect did you behave badly to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you know that in those early days it was on account of bodily infirmity that I proclaimed the Good News to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and yet the bodily infirmity which was such a trial to you, you did not regard with contempt or loathing, but you received me as if I had been an angel of God or Christ Jesus Himself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I ask you, then, what has become of your self-congratulations? For I bear you witness that had it been possible you would have torn out your own eyes and have given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Can it be that I have become your enemy through speaking the truth to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These men pay court to you, but not with honourable motives. They want to exclude you, so that you may pay court to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is always an honourable thing to be courted in an honourable cause; always, and not only when I am with you, my children–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>you for whom I am again, as it were, undergoing the pains of childbirth, until Christ is fully formed within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Would that I were with you and could change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me –you who want to continue to be subject to Law– will you not listen to the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave-girl and one by the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But we see that the child of the slave-girl was born in the common course of nature; but the child of the free woman in fulfilment of the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All this is allegorical; for the women represent two Covenants. One has its origin on Mount Sinai, and bears children destined for slavery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is Hagar; for the name Hagar stands for Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, which is in bondage together with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem which is above is free, and she is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, »Rejoice, thou barren woman that bearest not, break forth into a joyful cry, thou that dost not travail with child. For the desolate woman has many children–more indeed than she who has the husband.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But you, brethren, like Isaac, are children born in fulfilment of a promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet just as, at that time, the child born in the common course of nature persecuted the one whose birth was due to the power of the Spirit, so it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what says the Scripture? »Send away the slave-girl and her son, for never shall the slave-girl's son share the inheritance with the son of the free woman.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, brethren, since we are not the children of a slave-girl, but of the free woman–</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
