For this is what the Church of the ever-living God is, and it is the pillar and foundation-stone of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, beyond controversy, great is the mystery of our religion– that Christ appeared in human form, and His claims justified by the Spirit, was seen by angels and proclaimed among Gentile nations, was believed on in the world, and received up again into glory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
