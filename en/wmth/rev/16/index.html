People gnawed their tongues because of the pain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they spoke evil of the God in Heaven because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their misconduct.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sixth angel poured his bowl into that great river, the Euphrates; and its stream was dried up in order to clear the way for the kings who are to come from the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw three foul spirits, resembling frogs, issue from the mouth of the Dragon, from the mouth of the Wild Beast, and from the mouth of the false Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they are the spirits of demons working marvels–spirits that go out to control the kings of the whole earth, to assemble them for the battle which is to take place on the great day of God, the Ruler of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>(»I am coming like a thief.
