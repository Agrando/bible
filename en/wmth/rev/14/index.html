They follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They have been redeemed from among men, as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And no lie has ever been found upon their lips: they are faultless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I saw another angel flying across the sky, carrying the Good News of the Ages to tell to every nation, tribe, language and people, among those who live on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said in a loud voice, »Fear God and give Him glory, because the time of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made sky and earth, the sea and the water-springs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another, a second angel, followed, exclaiming, »Great Babylon has fallen, has fallen–she who made all the nations drink the wine of the anger provoked by her fornication.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And another, a third angel, followed them, exclaiming in a loud voice, »If any one worships the Wild Beast and his statue, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he shall drink the wine of God's anger which stands ready, undiluted, in the cup of His fury, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment goes up until the Ages of the Ages; and the worshipers of the Wild Beast and his statue have no rest day or night, nor has any one who receives the mark of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is an opportunity for endurance on the part of God's people, who carefully keep His commandments and the faith of Jesus!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice speaking from Heaven. It said, »Write as follows: »`Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from this time onward. Yes, says the Spirit, let them rest from their sorrowful labours; for what they have done goes with them.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I looked, and a white cloud appeared, and sitting on the cloud was some One resembling the Son of Man, having a wreath of gold upon His head and in His hand a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another, an angel, came out of the sanctuary, calling in a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, and saying, »Use your sickle and reap the harvest, for the hour for reaping it has come: the harvest of the earth is over-ripe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then He who sat on the cloud flung His sickle on the earth, and the earth had its harvest reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And another angel came out from the sanctuary in Heaven, and he too carried a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another angel came out from the altar –he who had power over fire– and he spoke in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, »Use your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of the earth, for its grapes are now quite ripe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel flung his sickle down to the earth, and reaped the vine of the earth and threw the grapes into the great winepress of God's anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and out of it came blood reaching the horses' bridles for a distance of 200 miles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
