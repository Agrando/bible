And I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men, but have put to the test those who say that they themselves are Apostles but are not, and you have found them to be liars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And you endure patiently and have borne burdens for My sake and have never grown weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet I have this against you–that you no longer love Me as you did at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Be mindful, therefore, of the height from which you have fallen. Repent at once, and act as you did at first, or else I will surely come and remove your lampstand out of its place–unless you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet this you have in your favor: you hate the doings of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»`Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches.

I tell you that the Devil is about to throw some of you into prison that you may be put to the test, and for ten days you will have to endure persecution. Be faithful to the End, even if you have to die, and then I will give you the victor's Wreath of Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»`Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches.
