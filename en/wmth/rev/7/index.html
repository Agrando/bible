He called in a loud voice to the four angels whose work it was to injure the earth and the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Injure neither land nor sea nor trees,« he said, »until we have sealed the bondservants of our God upon their foreheads.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the sealing was finished, I heard how many were sealed out of the tribes of the descendants of Israel.
