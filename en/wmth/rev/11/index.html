Do not measure it; for it has been given to the Gentiles, and for forty-two months they will trample the holy city under foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will authorize My two witnesses to prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»These witnesses are the two olive-trees, and they are the two lamps which stand in the presence of the Lord of the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if any one seeks to injure them–fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies; and if any one seeks to injure them, he will in this way certainly be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They have power given to them to seal up the sky, so that no rain may fall so long as they continue to prophesy; and power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with various plagues whenever they choose to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»And when they have fully delivered their testimony, the Wild Beast which is to rise out of the bottomless pit will make war upon them and overcome them and kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And their dead bodies are to lie in the broad street of the great city which spiritually is designated `Sodom' and `Egypt,' where indeed their Lord was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And men belonging to all peoples, tribes, languages and nations gaze at their dead bodies for three days and a half, but they refuse to let them be laid in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The inhabitants of the earth rejoice over them and are glad and will send gifts to one another; for these two Prophets had greatly troubled the inhabitants of the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But at the end of the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they rose to their feet; and all who saw them were terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they heard a loud voice calling to them out of Heaven, and bidding them come up; and they went up to Heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And just as that time there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city was overthrown. 7,000 people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The second Woe is past; the third Woe will soon be here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The seventh angel blew his trumpet; and there followed loud voices in Heaven which said, »The sovereignty of the world now belongs to our Lord and His Christ; and He will be King until the Ages of the Ages.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the twenty-four Elders, who sit on thrones in the presence of God, fell on their faces and worshipped God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying, »We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Ruler of all, Who art and wast, because Thou hast exerted Thy power, Thy great power, and hast become King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The nations grew angry, and Thine anger has come, and the time for the dead to be judged, and the time for Thee to give their reward to Thy servants the Prophets and to Thy people, and to those who fear Thee, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the doors of God's sanctuary in Heaven were opened, and the Ark, in which His Covenant was, was seen in His sanctuary; and there came flashes of lightning, and voices, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and heavy hail.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
