Afterwards he is to be set at liberty for a short time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I saw thrones, and some who were seated on them, to whom judgment was entrusted. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded on account of the testimony that they had borne to Jesus and on account of God's Message, and also the souls of those who had not worshipped the Wild Beast or his statue, nor received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands; and they came to Life and were kings with Christ for a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>No one else who was dead rose to Life until the thousand years were at an end. This is the First Resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed and holy are those who share in the First Resurrection. The Second Death has no power over them, but they shall be priests to God and to Christ, and shall be kings with Christ for the thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when the thousand years are at an end, the Adversary will be released from his imprisonment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and will go out to lead astray the nations in all the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, and assemble them for war, and they are like the sands on the seashore in number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they went up over the whole breadth of the earth and surrounded the encampment of God's people and the beloved city. But fire came down from Heaven and consumed them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the Devil, who had been leading them astray, was thrown into the Lake of fire and sulphur where the Wild Beast and the false Prophet were, and day and night they will suffer torture until the Ages of the Ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw a great white throne and One who was seated on it, from whose presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing in front of the throne. And books were opened; and so was another book–namely, the Book of Life; and the dead were judged by the things recorded in the books in accordance with what their conduct had been.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the sea yielded up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades yielded up the dead who were in them, and each man was judged in accordance with what his conduct had been.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Death and Hades were thrown into the Lake of fire; this is the Second Death–the Lake of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if any one's name was not found recorded in the Book of Life he was thrown into the Lake of fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
