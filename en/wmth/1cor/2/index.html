In the same way, also, only God's Spirit is acquainted with God's inner thoughts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which comes forth from God, that we may know the blessings that have been so freely given to us by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Of these we speak –not in language which man's wisdom teaches us, but in that which the Spirit teaches– adapting, as we do, spiritual words to spiritual truths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The unspiritual man rejects the things of the Spirit of God, and cannot attain to the knowledge of them, because they are spiritually judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the spiritual man judges of everything, although he is himself judged by no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For who has penetrated the mind of the Lord, and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
