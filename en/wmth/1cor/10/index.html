For it is written, »The People sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nor may we be fornicators, like some of them who committed fornication and on a single day 23,000 of them fell dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And do not let us test the Lord too far, as some of them tested Him and were destroyed by the serpents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And do not be discontented, as some of them were, and they were destroyed by the Destroyer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All this kept happening to them with a figurative meaning; but it was put on record by way of admonition to us upon whom the ends of the Ages have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then let him who thinks he is standing securely beware of falling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No temptation has you in its power but such as is common to human nature; and God is faithful and will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength. But, when the temptation comes, He will also provide the way of escape; so that you may be able to bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, my dear friends, avoid all connection with the worship of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I speak as to men of sense: judge for yourselves of what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The cup of blessing, which we bless, does it not mean a joint-participation in the blood of Christ? The loaf of bread which we break, does it not mean a joint-participation in the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Since there is one loaf, we who are many are one body; we, all of us, share in that one loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look at the Israelites–the nation and their ritual. Are not those who eat the sacrifices joint-partakers in the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do I mean that a thing sacrificed to an idol is what it claims to be, or that an idol is a real thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No, but that which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, not to God; and I would not have you have fellowship with one another through the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You cannot drink the Lord's cup and the cup of demons: you cannot be joint-partakers both in the table of the Lord and in the table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Or are we actually arousing the Lord to jealousy. Are we stronger than He is?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Everything is allowable, but not everything is profitable. Everything is allowable, but everything does not build others up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no one be for ever seeking his own good, but let each seek that of his fellow man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Anything that is for sale in the meat market, eat, and ask no questions for conscience' sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for the earth is the Lord's, and all that it contains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If an unbeliever gives you an invitation and you are disposed to accept it, eat whatever is put before you, and ask no questions for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if any one tells you, »This food has been offered in sacrifice;« abstain from eating it–out of respect for him who warned you, and, as before, for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But now I mean his conscience, not your own. »Why, on what ground,« you may object, »is the question of my liberty of action to be decided by a conscience not my own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If, so far as I am concerned, I partake with a grateful heart, why am I to be found fault with in regard to a thing for which I give thanks?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Whether, then, you are eating or drinking, or whatever you are doing, let everything be done to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Do not be causes of stumbling either to Jews or to Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>That is the way that I also seek in everything the approval of all men, not aiming at my own profit, but at that of the many, in the hope that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
