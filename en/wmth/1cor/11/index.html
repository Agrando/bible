But since it is a dishonor to a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her wear a veil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a man ought not to have a veil on his head, since he is the image and glory of God; while woman is the glory of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Man does not take his origin from woman, but woman takes hers from man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For man was not created for woman's sake, but woman for man's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That is why a woman ought to have on her head a symbol of subjection, because of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yet, in the Lord, woman is not independent of man nor man independent of woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For just as woman originates from man, so also man comes into existence through woman, but everything springs originally from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge of this for your own selves: is it seemly for a woman to pray to God when she is unveiled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Does not Nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a dishonor to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but that if a woman has long hair it is her glory, because her hair was given her for a covering?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if any one is inclined to be contentious on the point, we have no such custom, nor have the Churches of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But while giving you these instructions, there is one thing I cannot praise–your meeting together, with bad rather than good results.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for, in the first place, when you meet as a Church, there are divisions among you. This is what I am told, and I believe that there is some truth in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must of necessity be differences of opinion among you, in order that it may be plainly seen who are the men of sterling worth among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When, however, you meet in one place, there is no eating the Supper of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for it is his own supper of which each of you is in a hurry to partake, and one eats like a hungry man, while another has already drunk to excess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Why, have you no homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you wish to show your contempt for the Church of God and make those who have no homes feel ashamed? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this matter I certainly do not praise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For it was from the Lord that I received the facts which, in turn, I handed on to you; how that the Lord Jesus, on the night He was to be betrayed, took some bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and after giving thanks He broke it and said, »This is my body which is about to be broken for you. Do this in memory of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way, when the meal was over, He also took the cup. »This cup,« He said, »is the new Covenant of which my blood is the pledge. Do this, every time that you drink it, in memory of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For every time that you eat this bread and drink from the cup, you are proclaiming the Lord's death–until He returns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whoever, therefore, in an unworthy manner, eats the bread or drinks from the cup of the Lord sins against the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man examine himself, and, having done that, then let him eat the bread and drink from the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For any one who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgement to himself, if he fails to estimate the body aright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That is why many among you are sickly and out of health, and why not a few die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If, however, we estimated ourselves aright, we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged by the Lord, chastisement follows, to save us from being condemned along with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, brethren, when you come together for this meal, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If any one is hungry, let him eat at home; so that your coming together may not lead to judgement. The other matters I will deal with whenever I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
