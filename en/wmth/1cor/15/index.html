But I labored more strenuously than all the rest–yet it was not I, but God's grace working with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But whether it is I or they, this is the way we preach and the way that you came to believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if Christ is preached as having risen from the dead, how is it that some of you say that there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If there is no such thing as a resurrection of the dead, then Christ Himself has not risen to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if Christ has not risen, it follows that what we preach is a delusion, and that your faith also is a delusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nay more, we are actually being discovered to be bearing false witness about God, because we have testified that God raised Christ to life, whom He did not raise, if in reality none of the dead are raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if none of the dead are raised to life, then Christ has not risen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if Christ has not risen, your faith is a vain thing–you are still in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It follows also that those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If in this present life we have a hope resting on Christ, and nothing more, we are more to be pitied than all the rest of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, in reality, Christ has risen from among the dead, being the first to do so of those who are asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For seeing that death came through man, through man comes also the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For just as through Adam all die, so also through Christ all will be made alive again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this will happen to each in the right order–Christ having been the first to rise, and afterwards Christ's people rising at His return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Later on, comes the End, when He is to surrender the Kingship to God, the Father, when He shall have overthrown all other government and all other authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For He must continue King until He shall have put all His enemies under His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy that is to be overthrown is Death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for He will have put all things in subjection under His feet. And when He shall have declared that »All things are in subjection,« it will be with the manifest exception of Him who has reduced them all to subjection to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when the whole universe has been made subject to Him, then the Son Himself will also become subject to Him who has made the universe subject to Him, in order that GOD may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise what will become of those who got themselves baptized for the dead? If the dead do not rise at all, why are these baptized for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Why also do we Apostles expose ourselves to danger every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I protest, brethren, as surely as I glory over you –which I may justly do in Christ Jesus our Lord– that I die day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If from merely human motives I have fought with wild beasts in Ephesus, what profit is it to me? If the dead do not rise, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we are to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not deceive yourselves:»Evil companionships corrupt good morals.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wake from this drunken fit; live righteous lives, and cease to sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak thus in order to move you to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will say, »How can the dead rise? And with what kind of body do they come back?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Foolish man! the seed you yourself sow has no life given to it unless it first dies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and as for what you sow, it is not the plant which is to be that you are sowing, but a bare grain, of wheat (it may be) or of something else, and God gives it a body as He has seen fit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and to each kind of seed a body of its own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same: there is human flesh, and flesh of cattle, of birds, and of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are bodies which are celestial and there are bodies which are earthly, but the glory of the celestial ones is one thing, and that of the earthly ones is another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in a state of decay, it is raised free from decay;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>an animal body is sown, a spiritual body is raised. As surely as there is an animal body, so there is also a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>In the same way also it is written, »The first man Adam became a living animal«; the last Adam is a life-giving Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Nevertheless, it is not what is spiritual that came first, but what is animal; what is spiritual came afterwards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man is a man of earth, earthy; the second man is from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>What the earthy one is, that also are those who are earthy; and what the heavenly One is, that also are those who are heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have borne a resemblance to the earthy one, let us see to it that we also bear a resemblance to the heavenly One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But this I tell you, brethren: our mortal bodies cannot inherit the Kingdom of God, nor will what is perishable inherit what is imperishable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I tell you a truth hitherto kept secret: we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the sounding of the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incapable of decay, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For so it must be: this perishable nature must clothe itself with what is imperishable, and this mortality must clothe itself with immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But when this perishable nature has put on what is imperishable, and this mortality has put on immortality, then will the words of Scripture be fulfilled, »Death has been swallowed up in victory.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>»Where, O death, is thy victory? Where, O death, is thy sting?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Now sin is the sting of death, and sin derives its power from the Law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>but God be thanked who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my dear brethren, be firm, unmovable, busily occupied at all times in the Lord's work, knowing that your toil is not fruitless in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
