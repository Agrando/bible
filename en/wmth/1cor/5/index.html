Do you not know that a little yeast corrupts the whole of the dough?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Get rid of the old yeast so that you may be dough of a new kind; for in fact you are free from corruption. For our Passover Lamb has already been offered in sacrifice–even Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore let us keep our festival not with old yeast nor with the yeast of what is evil and mischievous, but with bread free from yeast–the bread of transparent sincerity and of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I wrote to you in that letter that you were not to associate with fornicators;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>not that in this world you are to keep wholly aloof from such as they, any more than from people who are avaricious and greedy of gain, or from worshippers of idols. For that would mean that you would be compelled to go out of the world altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But what I meant was that you were not to associate with any one bearing the name of »brother,« if he was addicted to fornication or avarice or idol-worship or abusive language or hard-drinking or greed of gain. With such a man you ought not even to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For what business of mine is it to judge outsiders? Is it not for you to judge those who are within the Church</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>while you leave to God's judgement those who are outside? Remove the wicked man from among you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
