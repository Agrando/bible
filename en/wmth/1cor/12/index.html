If the whole body were an ear, where would the nostrils be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But, as a matter of fact, God has arranged the parts in the body –every one of them– as He has seen fit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If they were all one part, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, as a matter of fact, there are many parts and but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is also impossible for the eye to say to the hand, »I do not need you;« or again for the head to say to the feet, »I do not need you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>No, it is quite otherwise. Even those parts of the body which are apparently somewhat feeble are yet indispensable;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and those which we deem less honorable we clothe with more abundant honor; and so our ungraceful parts come to have a more abundant grace, while our graceful parts have everything they need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But it was God who built up the body, and bestowed more abundant honor on the part that felt the need,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there might be no disunion in the body, but that all the members might entertain the same anxious care for one another's welfare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one part is suffering, every other part suffers with it; or if one part is receiving special honor, every other part shares in the joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As for you, you are the body of Christ, and individually you are members of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And by God's appointment there are in the Church–first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly teachers. Then come miraculous powers, and then ability to cure diseases or render loving service, or powers of organization, or varieties of the gift of `tongues.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Are all teachers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Have all miraculous powers? Have all ability to cure diseases? Do all speak in `tongues'? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But always seek to excel in the greater gifts. And now I will point out to you a way of life which transcends all others.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
