Love knows neither envy nor jealousy. Love is not forward and self-assertive, nor boastful and conceited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>She does not behave unbecomingly, nor seek to aggrandize herself, nor blaze out in passionate anger, nor brood over wrongs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>She finds no pleasure in injustice done to others, but joyfully sides with the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>She knows how to be silent. She is full of trust, full of hope, full of patient endurance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will be done away with; if there are languages, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be brought to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For our knowledge is imperfect, and so is our prophesying;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but when the perfect state of things is come, all that is imperfect will be brought to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When I was a child, I talked like a child, felt like a child, reasoned like a child: when I became a man, I put from me childish ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the present we see things as if in a mirror, and are puzzled; but then we shall see them face to face. For the present the knowledge I gain is imperfect; but then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And so there remain Faith, Hope, Loveâ€“these three; and of these the greatest is Love.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
