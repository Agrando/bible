And if you are the court before which the world is to be judged, are you unfit to deal with these petty matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we are to sit in judgement upon angels–to say nothing of things belonging to this life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If therefore you have things belonging to this life which need to be decided, is it men who are absolutely nothing in the Church–is it they whom you make your judges?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say this to put you to shame. Has it come to this, that there does not exist among you a single wise man competent to decide between a man and his brother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To say no more, then, it is altogether a defect in you that you have law-suits with one another. Why not rather endure injustice? Why not rather submit to being defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On the contrary you yourselves inflict injustice and fraud, and upon brethren too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not know that unrighteous men will not inherit God's Kingdom? Cherish no delusion here. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor any who are guilty of unnatural crime,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor theives, nor avaricious people, nor any who are addicted to hard drinking, to abusive language or to greed of gain, will inherit God's Kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all this describes what some of you were. But now you have had every stain washed off: now you have been set apart as holy: now you have been pronounced free from guilt; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and through the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Everything is allowable to me, but not everything is profitable. Everything is allowable to me, but to nothing will I become a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Food of all kinds is meant for the stomach, and the stomach is meant for food, and God will cause both of them to perish. Yet the body does not exist for the purpose of fornication, but for the Master's service, and the Master exists for the body;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and as God by His power raised the Master to life, so He will also raise us up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ and make them the members of a prostitute? No, indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or do you not know that a man who has to do with a prostitute is one with her in body? For God says, »The two shall become one.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who is in union with the Master is one with Him in spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee from fornication. Any other sin that a human being commits lies outside the body; but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or do you not know that your bodies are a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is within you–the Spirit whom you have from God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you are not your own, for you have been redeemed at infinite cost. Therefore glorify God in your bodies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
