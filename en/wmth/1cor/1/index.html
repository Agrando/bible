One man says »I belong to Paul;« another »I belong to Apollos;« a third »I belong to Peter;« a fourth »I belong to Christ.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is the Christ in fragments? Is it Paul who was crucified on your behalf? Or were you baptized to be Paul's adherents?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for fear people should say that you were baptized to be my adherents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I did, however, baptize Stephanas' household also: but I do not think that I baptized any one else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the Good News; and not in merely wise words–lest the Cross of Christ should be deprived of its power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the Message of the Cross is foolishness to those who are on the way to perdition, but it is the power of God to those whom He is saving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For so it stands written, »I will exhibit the nothingness of the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will bring to nought.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is your wise man? Where your expounder of the Law? Where your investigator of the questions of this present age? Has not God shown the world's wisdom to be utter foolishness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For after the world by its wisdom –as God in His wisdom had ordained– had failed to gain the knowledge of God, God was pleased, by the apparent foolishness of the Message which we preach, to save those who accepted it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seeing that Jews demand miracles, and Greeks go in search of wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>while we proclaim a Christ who has been crucified–to the Jews a stumbling-block, to Gentiles foolishness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who have received the Call, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because that which the world deems foolish in God is wiser than men's wisdom, and that which it deems feeble in God is mightier than men's might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For consider, brethren, God's call to you. Not many who are wise with merely human wisdom, not many of position and influence, not many of noble birth have been called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But God has chosen the things which the world regards as foolish, in order to put its wise men to shame; and God has chosen the things which the world regards as destitute of influence, in order to put its powerful things to shame;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the things which the world regards as base, and those which it sets utterly at nought –things that have no existence– God has chosen in order to reduce to nothing things that do exist;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>to prevent any mortal man from boasting in the presence of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But you –and it is all God's doing– are in Christ Jesus: He has become for us a wisdom which is from God, consisting of righteousness and sanctification and deliverance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>in order that it may be as Scripture says, »He who boasts–let his boast be in the Lord.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
