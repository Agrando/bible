It will then be my glory on the day of Christ that I did not run my race in vain nor toil in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nay, even if my life is to be poured as a libation upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I rejoice, and I congratulate you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I bid you also share my gladness, and congratulate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But, if the Lord permits it, I hope before long to send Timothy to you, that I, in turn, may be cheered by getting news of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no one likeminded with him, who will cherish a genuine care for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Everybody concerns himself about his own interests, not about those of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you know Timothy's approved worth–how, like a child working with his father, he has served with me in furtherance of the Good News.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So it is he that I hope to send as soon as ever I see how things go with me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but trusting, as I do, in the Lord, I believe that I shall myself also come to you before long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet I deem it important to send Epaphroditus to you now–he is my brother and comrade both in labour and in arms, and is your messenger who has ministered to my needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I send him because he is longing to see you all and is distressed at your having heard of his illness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is true that he has been ill, and was apparently at the point of death; but God had pity on him, and not only on him, but also on me, to save me from having sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I am therefore all the more eager to send him, in the hope that when you see him again you may be glad and I may have the less sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him therefore with heartfelt Christian joy, and hold in honour men like him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because it was for the sake of Christ's work that he came so near death, hazarding, as he did, his very life in endeavouring to make good any deficiency that there might be in your gifts to me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
