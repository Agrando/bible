In any case Christ is preached–either perversely or in honest truth; and in that I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that it will result in my salvation through your prayers and a bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>in fulfilment of my eager expectation and hope that I shall never have reason to feel ashamed, but that by my perfect freedom of speech Christ will be glorified in me, now as always, either by my life or by my death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For, with me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But since to live means a longer stay on earth, that implies more labour for me–and not unsuccessful labour; and which I am to choose I cannot tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I am in a dilemma, my earnest desire being to depart and be with Christ, for that is far, far better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But for your sakes it is more important that I should still remain in the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I am convinced of this, and I know that I shall remain, and shall go on working side by side with you all, to promote your progress and joy in the faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that, as Christians, you may have additional reason for glorying about me as the result of my being with you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let the lives you live be worthy of the Good News of the Christ, in order that, whether I come and see you or, being absent, only hear of you, I may know that you are standing fast in one spirit and with one mind, fighting shoulder to shoulder for the faith of the Good News.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Never for a moment quail before your antagonists. Your fearlessness will be to them a sure token of impending destruction, but to you it will be a sure token of your salvation–a token coming from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For you have had the privilege granted you on behalf of Christ–not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer on His behalf;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>maintaining, as you do, the same kind of conflict that you once saw in me and which you still hear that I am engaged in.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
