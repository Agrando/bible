Indeed you have always been thoughtful for me, although opportunity failed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I do not refer to this through fear of privation, for (for my part) I have learned, whatever be my outward experiences, to be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know both how to live in humble circumstances and how to live amid abundance. I am fully initiated into all the mysteries both of fulness and of hunger, of abundance and of want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have strength for anything through Him who gives me power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet I thank you for taking your share in my troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you men and women of Philippi also know that at the first preaching of the Good News, when I had left Macedonia, no other Church except yourselves held communication with me about giving and receiving;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because even in Thessalonica you sent several times to minister to my needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Not that I crave for gifts from you, but I do want to see abundant fruit bring you honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have enough of everything –and more than enough. My wants are fully satisfied now that I have received from the hands of Epaphroditus the generous gifts which you sent me– they are a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, truly pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But my God –so great is His wealth of glory in Christ Jesus– will fully supply every need of yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to our God and Father be the glory throughout the Ages of the Ages! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My Christian greetings to every one of God's people. The brethren who are with me send their greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All God's people here greet you–especially the members of Caesar's household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
