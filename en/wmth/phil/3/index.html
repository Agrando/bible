For me to give you the same warnings as before is not irksome to me, while so far as you are concerned it is a safe precaution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beware of `the dogs,' the bad workmen, the self-mutilators.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For we are the true circumcision–we who render to God a spiritual worship and make our boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in outward ceremonies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>although I myself might have some excuse for confidence in outward ceremonies. If any one else claims a right to trust in them, far more may I:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>circumcised, as I was, on the eighth day, a member of the race of Israel and of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew sprung from Hebrews; as to the Law a Pharisee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>as to zeal, a persecutor of the Church; as to the righteousness which comes through Law, blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yet all that was gain to me–for Christ's sake I have reckoned it loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nay, I even reckon all things as pure loss because of the priceless privilege of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. And for His sake I have suffered the loss of everything, and reckon it all as mere refuse, in order that I may win Christ and be found in union with Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>not having a righteousness of my own, derived from the Law, but that which arises from faith in Christ–the righteousness which comes from God through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I long to know Christ and the power which is in His resurrection, and to share in His sufferings and die even as He died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>in the hope that I may attain to the resurrection from among the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I do not say that I have already won the race or have already reached perfection. But I am pressing on, striving to lay hold of the prize for which also Christ has laid hold of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Brethren, I do not imagine that I have yet laid hold of it. But this one thing I do–forgetting everything which is past and stretching forward to what lies in front of me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>with my eyes fixed on the goal I push on to secure the prize of God's heavenward call in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore let all of us who are mature believers cherish these thoughts; and if in any respect you think differently, that also God will make clear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But whatever be the point that we have already reached, let us persevere in the same course.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Brethren, vie with one another in imitating me, and carefully observe those who follow the example which we have set you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For there are many whom I have often described to you, and I now even with tears describe them, as being enemies to the Cross of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Their end is destruction, their bellies are their God, their glory is in their shame, and their minds are devoted to earthly things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We, however, are free citizens of Heaven, and we are waiting with longing expectation for the coming from Heaven of a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who, in the exercise of the power which He has even to subject all things to Himself, will transform this body of our humiliation until it resembles His own glorious body.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
