As He went further on,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He saw two other brothers, James the son of Zabdi and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zabdi mending their nets; and He called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they at once left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus travelled through all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus His fame spread through all Syria; and they brought all the sick to Him, the people who were suffering from various diseases and pains–demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics; and He cured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And great crowds followed Him, coming from Galilee, from the Ten Towns, from Jerusalem, and from beyond the district on the other side of the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
