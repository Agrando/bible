If you approve, I will put up three tents here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He was still speaking when a luminous cloud spread over them; and a voice was heard from within the cloud, which said, »This is My Son dearly beloved, in whom is My delight. Listen to Him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On hearing this voice, the disciples fell on their faces and were filled with terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus came and touched them, and said, »Rouse yourselves and have no fear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they looked up, and saw no one but Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As they were descending the mountain, Jesus laid a command upon them. »Tell no one,« He said, »of the sight you have seen till the Son of Man has risen from among the dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Why then,« asked the disciples, »do the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Elijah was indeed to come,« He replied, »and would reform everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I tell you that he has already come, and they did not recognize him, but dealt with him as they chose. And before long the Son of Man will be treated by them in a similar way.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then it dawned upon the disciples that it was John the Baptist about whom He had spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When they had returned to the people, there came to Him a man who fell on his knees before Him and besought Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Sir,« he said, »have pity on my son, for he is an epileptic and is very ill. Often he falls into the fire and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I have brought him to your disciples, and they have not been able to cure him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»O unbelieving and perverse generation!« replied Jesus; »how long shall I be with you? how long shall I endure you? Bring him to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jesus reprimanded the demon, and it came out and left him; and the boy was cured from that moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked Him, »Why could not we expel the demon?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Because your faith is so small,« He replied; »for I solemnly declare to you that if you have faith like a mustard-seed, you shall say to this mountain, `Remove from this place to that,' and it will remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But an evil spirit of this kind is only driven out by prayer and fasting.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As they were travelling about in Galilee, Jesus said to them, »The Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>they will put Him to death, but on the third day He will be raised to life again.« And they were exceedingly distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After their arrival at Capernaum the collectors of the half-shekel came and asked Peter, »Does not your Teacher pay the half-shekel?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Yes,« he replied, and then went into the house. But before he spoke a word Jesus said, »What think you, Simon? From whom do this world's kings receive customs or capitation tax? from their own children, or from others?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»From others,« he replied. »Then the children go free,« said Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»However, lest we cause them to sin, go and throw a hook into the Lake, and take the first fish that comes up. When you open its mouth, you will find a shekel in it: bring that coin and give it to them for yourself and me.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
