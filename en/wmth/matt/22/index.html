Then the king said to the servants,« `Bind him hand and foot and fling him into the darkness outside: there will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»For there are many called, but few chosen.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how they might entrap Him in His conversation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they sent to Him their disciples together with the Herodians; who said, »Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you faithfully teach God's truth; and that no fear of man misleads you, for you are not biased by men's wealth or rank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Give us your judgement therefore: is it allowable for us to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Perceiving their wickedness, Jesus replied, »Why are you hypocrites trying to ensnare me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me the tribute coin.« And they brought Him a shilling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Whose likeness and inscription,« He asked, »is this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Caesar's,« they replied. »Pay therefore,« He rejoined, »what is Caesar's to Caesar; and what is God's to God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They heard this, and were astonished; then left Him, and went their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On the same day a party of Sadducees came to Him, contending that there is no resurrection. And they put this case to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Teacher,« they said, »Moses enjoined, `If a man die childless, his brother shall marry his widow, and raise up a family for him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now we had among us seven brothers. The eldest of them married, but died childless, leaving his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So also did the second and the third, down to the seventh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>till the woman also died, after surviving them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At the Resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? for they all married her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The reply of Jesus was, »You are in error, through ignorance of the Scriptures and of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the Resurrection, men neither marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are like angels in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But as to the Resurrection of the dead, have you never read what God says to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>`I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of dead, but of living men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>All the crowd heard this, and were filled with amazement at His teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now the Pharisees came up when they heard that He had silenced the Sadducees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and one of them, an expounder of the Law, asked Him as a test question,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Teacher, which is the greatest Commandment in the Law?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'« He answered, »`with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the greatest and foremost Commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second is similar to it: `Thou shalt love thy fellow man as much as thyself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The whole of the Law and the Prophets is summed up in these two Commandments.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were still assembled there, Jesus put a question to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»What think you about the Christ,« He said, »whose son is He?«»David's,« they replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»How then,« He asked, »does David, taught by the Spirit, call Him Lord, when he says,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»`The Lord said to my Lord, sit at My right hand until I have put thy foes beneath thy feet'?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»If therefore David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>No one could say a word in reply, nor from that day did any one venture again to put a question to Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
