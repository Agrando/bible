What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Why then,« said they, »did Moses command the husband to give her `a written notice of divorce,' and so put her away?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Moses,« He replied, »in consideration of the hardness of your nature permitted you to put away your wives, but it has not been so from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I tell you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except her unfaithfulness, and marries another woman, commits adultery.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»If this is the case with a man in relation to his wife,« said the disciples to Him, »it is better not to marry.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»It is not every man,« He replied, »who can receive this teaching, but only those on whom the grace has been bestowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There are men who from their birth have been disabled from marriage, others who have been so disabled by men, and others who have disabled themselves for the sake of the Kingdom of the Heavens. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then young children were brought to Him for Him to put His hands on them and pray; but the disciples interfered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus however said, »Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them; for it is to those who are childlike that the Kingdom of the Heavens belongs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So He laid His hands upon them and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Teacher,« said one man, coming up to Him, »what that is good shall I do in order to win the Life of the Ages?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Why do you ask me,« He replied, »about what is good? There is only One who is truly good. But if you desire to enter into Life, keep the Commandments.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»Which Commandments?« he asked. Jesus answered, »`Thou shalt not kill;' `Thou shalt not commit adultery;' `Thou shalt not steal;' `Thou shalt not lie in giving evidence;'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`Honour thy father and thy mother'; and `Thou shalt love thy fellow man as much as thyself.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»All of these,« said the young man, »I have carefully kept. What do I still lack?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»If you desire to be perfect,« replied Jesus, »go and sell all that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have wealth in Heaven; and come, follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On hearing those words the young man went away much cast down; for he had much property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Jesus said to His disciples, »I solemnly tell you that it is with difficulty that a rich man will enter the Kingdom of the Heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These words utterly amazed the disciples, and they asked, »Who then can be saved?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus looked at them and said, »With men this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter said to Jesus, »See, we have forsaken everything and followed you; what then will be our reward?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»I solemnly tell you,« replied Jesus, »that in the New Creation, when the Son of Man has taken His seat on His glorious throne, all of you who have followed me shall also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And whoever has forsaken houses, or brothers or sisters, or father or mother, or children or lands, for my sake, shall receive many times as much and shall have as his inheritance the Life of the Ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»But many who are now first will be last, and many who are now last will be first.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
