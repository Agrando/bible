I know that it is Jesus that you are looking for–the crucified One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here: He has come back to life, as He foretold. Come and see the place where He lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead and is going before you into Galilee: there you shall see Him. Remember, I have told you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They quickly left the tomb and ran, still terrified but full of unspeakable joy, to carry the news to His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And then suddenly they saw Jesus coming to meet them. »Peace be to you,« He said. And they came and clasped His feet, bowing to the ground before Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then He said, »Dismiss all fear! Go and take word to my brethren to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While they went on this errand, some of the guards came into the city and reported to the High Priests every detail of what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the latter held a conference with the Elders, and after consultation with them they heavily bribed the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>telling them to say, »His disciples came during the night and stole his body while we were asleep.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»And if this,« they added, »is reported to the Governor, we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story was noised about among the Jews, and is current to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for the eleven disciples, they proceeded into Galilee, to the hill where Jesus had arranged to meet them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There they saw Him and prostrated themselves before Him. Yet some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus however came near and said to them, »All power in Heaven and over the earth has been given to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations; baptize them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and teach them to obey every command which I have given you. And remember, I am with you always, day by day, until the Close of the Age.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
