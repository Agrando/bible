They are blind guides of the blind; and if a blind man leads a blind man, both will fall into some pit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Explain to us this figurative language,« said Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Are even you,« He answered, »still without intellingence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not understand that whatever enters the mouth passes into the stomach and is afterwards ejected from the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things that come out of the mouth proceed from the heart, and it is these that defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart proceed wicked thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, perjury, impiety of speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things which defile the man; but eating with unwashed hands does not defile.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew into the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Here a Canaanitish woman of the district came out and persistently cried out, »Sir, Son of David, pity me; my daughter is cruelly harassed by a demon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But He answered her not a word. Then the disciples interposed, and begged Him, saying, »Send her away because she keeps crying behind us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I have only been sent to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,« He replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then she came and threw herself at His feet and entreated Him. »O Sir, help me,« she said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»It is not right,« He said, »to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Be it so, Sir,« she said, »for even the dogs eat the scraps which fall from their masters' tables.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»O woman,« replied Jesus, »great is your faith: be it done to you as you desire.« And from that moment her daughter was restored to health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Again, moving thence, Jesus went along by the Lake of Galilee; and ascending the hill, He sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Soon great crowds came to Him, bringing with them those who were crippled in feet or hands, blind or dumb, and many besides, and they hastened to lay them at His feet. And He cured them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that the people were amazed to see the dumb speaking, the maimed with their hands perfect, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they gave the glory to the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, »My heart yearns over this mass of people, for it is now the third day that they have been with me and they have nothing to eat. I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they should faint on the road.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Where can we,« asked the disciples, »get bread enough in this remote place to satisfy so vast a multitude?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»How many loaves have you?« Jesus asked. »Seven,« they said, »and a few small fish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So He bade all the people sit down on the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and He took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks He broke them up and then distributed them to the disciples, and they to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all ate and were satisfied. The broken portions that remained over they took up–seven full hampers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Those who ate were 4,000 adult men, without reckoning women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He then dismissed the people, went on board the boat, and came into the district of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
