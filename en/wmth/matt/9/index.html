Seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic, »Take courage, my child; your sins are pardoned.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Such language is impious,« said some of the Scribes among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Knowing their thoughts Jesus said, »Why are you cherishing evil thoughts in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why, which is easier? –to say, `Your sins are pardoned,' or to say `Rise up and walk'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But, to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins« –He then says to the paralytic, »Rise, and take up your bed and go home.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he got up, and went off home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the crowds were awe-struck when they saw it, and ascribed the glory to God who had entrusted such power to a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Passing on thence Jesus saw a man called Matthew sitting at the Toll Office, and said to him, »Follow me.« And he arose, and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while He was reclining at table, a large number of tax-gathers and notorious sinners were of the party with Jesus and His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisees noticed this, and they inquired of His disciples, »Why does your Teacher eat with the tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He heard the question and replied, »It is not men in good health who require a doctor, but the sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But go and learn what this means, `It is mercy that I desire, not sacrifice'; for I did not come to appeal to the righteous, but to sinners.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At that time John's disciples came and asked Jesus, »Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Can the bridegroom's party mourn,« He replied, »as long as the bridegroom is with them? But other days will come (when the Bridegroom has been taken from them) and then they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No one ever mends an old cloak with a patch of newly woven cloth. Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away some of the old, and a worse hole would be made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nor do people pour new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the skins would split, the wine would escape, and the skins be destroyed. But they put new wine into fresh skins, and both are saved.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While He was thus speaking, a Ruler came up and profoundly bowing said, »My daughter is just dead; but come and put your hand upon her and she will return to life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus rose and followed him, as did also His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage came behind Him and touched the tassel of His cloak;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for she said to herself, »If I but touch His cloak, I shall be cured.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus turned and saw her, and said, »Take courage, daughter; your faith has cured you.« And the woman was restored to health from that moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Entering the Ruler's house, Jesus saw the flute-players and the crowd loudly wailing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and He said, »Go out of the room; the little girl is not dead, but asleep.« And they laughed at Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When however the place was cleared of the crowd, Jesus went in, and on His taking the little girl by the hand, she rose up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the report of this spread throughout all that district.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As Jesus passed on, two blind men followed Him, shouting and saying, »Pity us, Son of David.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when He had gone indoors, they came to Him. »Do you believe that I can do this?« He asked them. »Yes, Sir,« they replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So He touched their eyes and said, »According to your faith let it be to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then their eyes were opened. And assuming a stern tone Jesus said to them, »Be careful to let no one know.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they went out and published His fame in all that district.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And as they were leaving His presence a dumb demoniac was brought to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When the demon was expelled, the dumb man could speak. And the crowds exclaimed in astonishment, »Never was such a thing seen in Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees maintained, »It is by the power of the Prince of the demons that he drives out the demons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus continued His circuits through all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when He saw the crowds He was touched with pity for them, because they were distressed and were fainting on the ground like sheep which have no shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then He said to His disciples, »The harvest is abundant, but the reapers are few;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>therefore entreat the Owner of the Harvest to send out reapers into His fields.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
