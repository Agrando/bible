And they questioned Him, »Is it right to cure people on the Sabbath?« Their intention was to bring a charge against Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Which of you is there,« He replied, »who, if he has but a single sheep and it falls into a hole on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not a man, however, far superior to a sheep? Therefore it is right to do good on the Sabbath.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then He said to the man, »Stretch out your arm.« And he stretched it out, and it was restored quite sound like the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Pharisees after leaving the synagogue consulted together against Him, how they might destroy Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Aware of this, Jesus departed elsewhere; and a great number of people followed Him, all of whom He cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But He gave them strict injunctions not to blaze abroad His doings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that those words of the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»This is My servant whom I have chosen, My dearly loved One in whom My soul takes pleasure. I will put My spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will not wrangle or raise His voice, nor will His voice be heard in the broadways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A crushed reed He will not utterly break, nor will He quench the still smouldering wick, until He has led on Justice to victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And on His name shall the nations rest their hopes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>At that time a demoniac was brought to Him, blind and dumb; and He cured him, so that the dumb man could speak and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the crowds of people were all filled with amazement and said, »Can this be the Son of David?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Pharisees heard it and said, »This man only expels demons by the power of Baal-zebul, the Prince of demons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Knowing their thoughts He said to them, »Every kingdom in which civil war has raged suffers desolation; and every city or house in which there is internal strife will be brought low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan is expelling Satan, he has begun to make war on himself: how therefore shall his kingdom last?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if it is by Baal-zebul's power that I expel the demons, by whose power do your disciples expel them? They therefore shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if it is by the power of the Spirit of God that I expel the demons, it is evident that the Kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Again, how can any one enter the house of a strong man and carry off his goods, unless first of all he masters and secures the strong man: then he will ransack his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»The man who is not with me is against me, and he who is not gathering with me is scattering abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>This is why I tell you that men may find forgiveness for every other sin and impious word, but that for impious speaking against the Holy Spirit they shall find no forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whoever shall speak against the Son of Man may obtain forgiveness; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, neither in this nor in the coming age shall he obtain forgiveness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Either grant the tree to be wholesome and its fruit wholesome, or the tree poisonous and its fruit poisonous; for the tree is known by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O vipers' brood, how can you speak what is good when you are evil? For it is from the overflow of the heart that the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A good man from his good store produces good things, and a bad man from his bad store produces bad things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I tell you that for every careless word that men shall speak they will be held accountable on the day of Judgement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For each of you by his words shall be justified, or by his words shall be condemned.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then He was accosted by some of the Scribes and of the Pharisees who said, »Teacher, we wish to see a sign given by you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Wicked and faithless generation!« He replied, »they clamour for a sign, but none shall be given to them except the sign of the Prophet Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For just as Jonah was three days in the sea-monster's belly, so will the Son of Man be three days in the heart of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There will stand up men of Nineveh at the Judgement together with the present generation, and will condemn it; because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and mark! there is One greater than Jonah here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The Queen of the south will awake at the Judgement together with the present generation, and will condemn it; because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and mark! there is One greater than Solomon here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»No sooner however has the foul spirit gone out of the man, then he roams about in places where there is no water, seeking rest but finding none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he says, `I will return to my house that I left;' and he comes and finds it unoccupied, swept clean, and in good order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he goes and brings back with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they come in and dwell there; and in the end that man's condition becomes worse than it was at first. So will it be also with the present wicked generation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While He was still addressing the people His mother and His brothers were standing on the edge of the crowd desiring to speak to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So some one told Him, »Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, and desire to speak to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»Who is my mother?« He said to the man; »and who are my brothers?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And pointing to His disciples He added, »See here are my mother and my brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>To obey my Father who is in Heaven–that is to be my brother and my sister and my mother.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
