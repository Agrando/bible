I solemnly tell you that they already have their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But when you are giving in charity, let not your left hand perceive what your right hand is doing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that your charities may be in secret; and then your Father –He who sees in secret– will recompense you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»And when praying, you must not be like the hypocrites. They are fond of standing and praying in the synagogues or at the corners of the wider streets, in order that men may see them. I solemnly tell you that they already have their reward.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you, whenever you pray, go into your own room and shut the door: then pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father –He who sees in secret– will recompense you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»And when praying, do not use needless repetitions as the Gentiles do, for they expect to be listened to because of their multitude of words.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not, however, imitate them; for your Father knows what things you need before ever you ask Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»In this manner therefore pray: `Our Father who art in Heaven, may Thy name be kept holy;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>let Thy kingdom come; let Thy will be done, as in Heaven so on earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>give us to-day our bread for the day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and forgive us our shortcomings, as we also have forgiven those who have failed in their duty towards us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and bring us not into temptation, but rescue us from the Evil one.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»For if you forgive others their offences, your Heavenly Father will forgive you also;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if you do not forgive others their offences, neither will your Father forgive yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»When any of you fast, never assume gloomy looks as the hypocrites do; for they disfigure their faces in order that it may be evident to men that they are fasting. I solemnly tell you that they already have their reward.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, whenever you fast, pour perfume on your hair and wash your face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that it may not be apparent to men that you are fasting, but to your Father who is in secret; and your Father –He who sees in secret– will recompense you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Do not lay up stores of wealth for yourselves on earth, where the moth and wear-and-tear destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But amass wealth for yourselves in Heaven, where neither the moth nor wear-and-tear destroys, and where thieves do not break in and steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your wealth is, there also will your heart be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The eye is the lamp of the body. If then your eyesight is good, your whole body will be well lighted;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but if your eyesight is bad, your whole body will be dark. If however the very light within you is darkness, how dense must the darkness be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»No man can be the bondservant of two masters; for either he will dislike one and like the other, or he will attach himself to one and think slightingly of the other. You cannot be the bondservants both of God and of gold.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For this reason I charge you not to be over-anxious about your lives, inquiring what you are to eat or what you are to drink, nor yet about your bodies, inquiring what clothes you are to put on. Is not the life more precious than its food, and the body than its clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Look at the birds which fly in the air: they do not sow or reap or store up in barns, but your Heavenly Father feeds them: are not you of much greater value than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Which of you by being over-anxious can add a single foot to his height?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And why be anxious about clothing? Learn a lesson from the wild lilies. Watch their growth. They neither toil nor spin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his magnificence could array himself like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if God so clothes the wild herbage which to-day flourishes and to-morrow is thrown into the oven, is it not much more certain that He will clothe you, you men of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do not be over-anxious, therefore, asking `What shall we eat?' or `What shall we drink?' or `What shall we wear?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all these are questions that Gentiles are always asking; but your Heavenly Father knows that you need these things–all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But make His Kingdom and righteousness your chief aim, and then these things shall all be given you in addition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Do not be over-anxious, therefore, about to-morrow, for to-morrow will bring its own cares. Enough for each day are its own troubles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
