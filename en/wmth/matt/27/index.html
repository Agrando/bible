But they kept on furiously shouting, »Let him be crucified!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when he saw that he could gain nothing, but that on the contrary there was a riot threatening, he called for water and washed his hands in sight of them all, saying, »I am not responsible for this murder: you must answer for it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»His blood,« replied all the people, »be on us and on our children!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he ordered to be scourged, and gave Him up to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the Governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium, and called together the whole battalion to make sport of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Stripping off His garments, they put on Him a general's short crimson cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They twisted a wreath of thorny twigs and put it on His head, and they put a sceptre of cane in His right hand, and kneeling to Him they shouted in mockery, »Long live the King of the Jews!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they spat upon Him, and taking the cane they repeatedly struck Him on the head with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At last, having finished their sport, they took off the cloak, clothed Him again in His own garments, and led Him away for crucifixion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Going out they met a Cyrenaean named Simon; whom they compelled to carry His cross,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and so they came to a place called Golgotha, which means `Skull-ground.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Here they gave Him a mixture of wine and gall to drink, but having tasted it He refused to drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>After crucifying Him, they divided His garments among them by lot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and sat down there on guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Over His head they placed a written statement of the charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>At the same time two robbers were crucified with Him, one at His right hand and the other at His left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the passers-by reviled Him. They shook their heads at Him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and said, »You who would pull down the Sanctuary and build a new one within three days, save yourself. If you are God's Son, come down from the cross.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>In like manner the High Priests also, together with the Scribes and the Elders, taunted Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»He saved others,« they said, »himself he cannot save! He is the King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>His trust is in God: let God deliver him now, if He will have him; for he said, `I am God's Son.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Insults of the same kind were heaped on Him even by the robbers who were being crucified with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from noon until three o'clock in the afternoon there was darkness over the whole land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>but about three o'clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, »Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?« that is to say, »My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»The man is calling for Elijah,« said some of the bystanders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>One of them ran forthwith, and filling a sponge with sour wine put it on the end of a cane and offered it Him to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>while the rest said, »Let us see whether Elijah is coming to deliver him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus uttered another loud cry and then yielded up His spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Immediately the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom: the earth quaked; the rocks split;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>the tombs opened; and many of God's people who were asleep in death awoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And coming out of their tombs after Christ's resurrection they entered the holy city and showed themselves to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>As for the Captain and the soldiers who were with Him keeping guard over Jesus, when they witnessed the earthquake and the other occurrences they were filled with terror, and exclaimed, »Assuredly he was God's Son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And there were a number of women there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to His necessities;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>among them being Mary of Magdala, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zabdi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Towards sunset there came a wealthy inhabitant of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who himself also had become a disciple of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>He went to Pilate and begged to have the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean sheet of fine linen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>He then laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn in the solid rock, and after rolling a great stone against the door of the tomb he went home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Mary of Magdala and the other Mary were both present there, sitting opposite to the sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>On the next day, the day after the Preparation, the High Priests and the Pharisees came in a body to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>»Sir,« they said, »we recollect that during his lifetime that impostor pretended that after two days he was to rise to life again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>So give orders for the sepulchre to be securely guarded till the third day, for fear his disciples should come by night and steal the body, and then tell the people that he has come back to life; and so the last imposture will be more serious than the first.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>»You can have a guard,« said Pilate:»go and make all safe, as best you can.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>So they went and made the sepulchre secure, sealing the stone besides setting the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
