Go out and meet him!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Then all those bridesmaids roused themselves and trimmed their torches.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»`Give us some of your oil,' said the foolish ones to the wise, `for our torches are going out.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»`But perhaps,' replied the wise, `there will not be enough for all of us. Go to the shops rather, and buy some for yourselves.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»So they went to buy. But meanwhile the bridegroom came; those bridesmaids who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet; and the door was shut.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Afterwards the other bridesmaids came and cried,« `Sir, Sir, open the door to us.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»`In solemn truth I tell you,' he replied, `I do not know you.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Keep awake therefore; for you know neither the day nor the hour.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Why, it is like a man who, when going on his travels, called his bondservants and entrusted his property to their care.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one–to each according to his individual capacity; and then started from home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Without delay the one who had received the five talents went and employed them in business, and gained five more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the same way he who had the two gained two more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the man who had received the one went and dug a hole and buried his master's money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»After a long lapse of time the master of those servants returned, and had a reckoning with them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The one who had received the five talents came and brought five more, and said, »`Sir, it was five talents that you entrusted to me: see, I have gained five more.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»`You have done well, good and trustworthy servant,' replied his master; `you have been trustworthy in the management of a little, I will put you in charge of much: share your master's joy.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»The second, who had received the two talents, came and said,« `Sir, it was two talents you entrusted to me: see, I have gained two more.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»`Good and trustworthy servant, you have done well,' his master replied; `you have been trustworthy in the management of a little, I will put you in charge of much: share your master's joy.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»But, next, the man who had the one talent in his keeping came and said,« `Sir, I knew you to be a severe man, reaping where you had not sown and garnering what you had not winnowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So being afraid I went and buried your talent in the ground: there you have what belongs to you.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»`You wicked and slothful servant,' replied his master, `did you know that I reap where I have not sown, and garner what I have not winnowed?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Your duty then was to deposit my money in some bank, and so when I came I should have got back my property with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So take away the talent from him, and give it to the man who has the ten.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For to every one who has, more shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him who has nothing, even what he has shall be taken away.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>`But as for this worthless servant, put him out into the darkness outside: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then will He sit upon His glorious throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and all the nations will be gathered into His presence. And He will separate them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and will make the sheep stand at His right hand, and the goats at His left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Then the King will say to those at His right,« `Come, my Father's blessed ones, receive your inheritance of the Kingdom which has been divinely intended for you ever since the creation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For when I was hungry, you gave me food; when I was thirsty, you gave me drink; when I was homeless, you gave me a welcome;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>when I was ill-clad, you clothed me; when I was sick, you visited me; when I was in prison, you came to see me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»`When, Lord,' the righteous will reply, `did we see Thee hungry, and feed Thee; or thirsty, and give Thee drink?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>When did we see Thee homeless, and give Thee a welcome? or ill-clad, and clothe Thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When did we see Thee sick or in prison, and come to see Thee?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»But the King will answer them,« `In solemn truth I tell you that in so far as you rendered such services to one of the humblest of these my brethren, you rendered them to myself.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Then will He say to those at His left,« `Begone from me, with the curse resting upon you, into the Fire of the Ages, which has been prepared for the Devil and his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For when I was hungry, you gave me nothing to eat; when thirsty, you gave me nothing to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>when homeless, you gave me no welcome; ill-clad, you clothed me not; sick or in prison, you visited me not.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»Then will they also answer,« `Lord, when did we see Thee hungry or thirsty or homeless or ill-clad or sick or in prison, and not come to serve Thee?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>»But he will reply,« `In solemn truth I tell you that in so far as you withheld such services from one of the humblest of these, you withheld them from me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»And these shall go away into the Punishment of the Ages, but the righteous into the Life of the Ages.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
