To one I say `Go,' and he goes, to another `Come,' and he comes, and to my slave `Do this or that,' and he does it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus listened to this reply, and was astonished, and said to the people following Him, »I solemnly tell you that in no Israelite have I found faith as great as this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west and will recline at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of the Heavens,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>while the natural heirs of the Kingdom will be driven out into the darkness outside: there will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jesus said to the Captain, »Go, and just as you have believed, so be it for you.« And the servant recovered precisely at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After this Jesus went to the house of Peter, whose mother-in-law he found ill in bed with fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He touched her hand and the fever left her: and then she rose and waited upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the evening many demoniacs were brought to Him, and with a word He expelled the demons; and He cured all the sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>in order that this prediction of the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, »He took on Him our weaknesses, and bore the burden of our diseases.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing great crowds about Him Jesus had given directions to cross to the other side of the Lake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>when a Scribe came and said to Him, »Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Foxes have holes,« replied Jesus, »and birds have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Another of the disciples said to Him, »Sir, allow me first to go and bury my father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Follow me,« said Jesus, »and leave the dead to bury their own dead.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then He went on board a fishing-boat, and His disciples followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But suddenly there arose a great storm on the Lake, so that the waves threatened to engulf the boat; but He was asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So they came and woke Him, crying, »Master, save us, we are drowning!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Why are you so easily frightened,« He replied, »you men of little faith?« Then He rose and reproved the winds and the waves, and there was a perfect calm;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the men, filled with amazement, exclaimed, »What kind of man is this? for the very winds and waves obey him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>On His arrival at the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, there met Him two men possessed by demons, coming from among the tombs: they were so dangerously fierce that no one was able to pass that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They cried aloud, »What hast Thou to do with us, Thou Son of God? Hast Thou come here to torment us before the time?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now at some distance from them a vast herd of swine were feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the demons entreated Him. »If Thou drivest us out,« they said, »send us into the herd of swine.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Go,« He replied. Then they came out from the men and went into the swine, whereupon the entire herd instantly rushed down the cliff into the Lake and perished in the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The swineherds fled, and went and told the whole story in the town, including what had happened to the demoniacs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So at once the whole population came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they besought Him to leave their country.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
