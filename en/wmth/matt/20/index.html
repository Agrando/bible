Again about twelve, and about three o'clock, he went out and did the same.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And going out about five o'clock he found others loitering, and he asked them, »`Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`Because no one has hired us,' they replied. »`You also, go into the vineyard,' he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When evening came, the master said to his steward, »`Call the men and pay them their wages. Begin with the last set and finish with the first.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»When those came who had begun at five o'clock, they received a shilling apiece;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and when the first came, they expected to get more, but they also each got the shilling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So when they had received it, they grumbled against the employer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»`These who came last have done only one hour's work, and you have put them on a level with us who have worked the whole day and have borne the scorching heat.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»`My friend,' he answered to one of them, `I am doing you no injustice. Did you not agree with me for a shilling?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take your money and go. I choose to give this last comer just as much as I give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Have I not a right to do what I choose with my own property? Or are you envious because I am generous?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»So the last shall be first, and the first last.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus was now going up to Jerusalem, and He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»We are going up to Jerusalem, and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and Scribes. They will condemn Him to death,«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and hand Him over to the Gentiles to be made sport of and scourged and crucified; and on the third day He will be raised to life.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the mother of the sons of Zabdi came to Him with her sons, and knelt before Him to make a request of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»What is it you desire?« He asked. »Command,« she replied, »that these my two sons may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your Kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»None of you know what you are asking for,« said Jesus; »can you drink out of the cup from which I am about to drink?«»We can,« they replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»You shall drink out of my cup,« He said, »but a seat at my right hand or at my left it is not for me to allot, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The other ten heard of this, and their indignation was aroused against the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called them to Him, and said, »You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Not so shall it be among you; but whoever desires to be great among you shall be your servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give His life as the redemption-price for many.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As they were leaving Jericho, an immense crowd following Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, and cried aloud, »Sir, Son of David, pity us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The people angrily tried to silence them, but they cried all the louder. »O Sir, Son of David, pity us,« they said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So Jesus stood still and called to them. »What shall I do for you?« He asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Sir, let our eyes be opened,« they replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
