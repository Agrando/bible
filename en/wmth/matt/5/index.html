There He seated Himself, and when His disciples came to Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He proceeded to teach them, and said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»Blessed are the poor in spirit, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»Blessed are the mourners, for they shall be comforted.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Blessed are the meek, for they as heirs shall obtain possession of the earth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be completely satisfied.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Blessed are the compassionate, for they shall receive compassion.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Blessed are the peacemakers, for it is they who will be recognized as sons of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Blessed are those who have borne persecution in the cause of Righteousness, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Blessed are you when they have insulted and persecuted you, and have said every cruel thing about you falsely for my sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be joyful and triumphant, because your reward is great in the Heavens; for so were the Prophets before you persecuted.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has become tasteless, in what way can it regain its saltness? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown away and trodden on by the passers by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are the light of the world; a town cannot be hid if built on a hill-top.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor is a lamp lighted to be put under a bushel, but on the lampstand; and then it gives light to all in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Just so let your light shine before all men, in order that they may see your holy lives and may give glory to your Father who is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Do not for a moment suppose that I have come to abrogate the Law or the Prophets: I have not come to abrogate them but to give them their completion.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Solemnly I tell you that until Heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or smallest detail will pass away from the Law until all has taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whoever therefore breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to break them, will be called the least in the Kingdom of the Heavens; but whoever practises them and teaches them, he will be acknowledged as great in the Kingdom of the Heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I assure you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the Scribes and the Pharisees, you will certainly not find entrance into the Kingdom of the Heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»You have heard that it was said to the ancients, `Thou shalt not commit murder', and whoever commits murder will be answerable to the magistrate.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you that every one who becomes angry with his brother shall be answerable to the magistrate; that whoever says to his brother `Raca,' shall be answerable to the Sanhedrin; and that whoever says, `You fool!' shall be liable to the Gehenna of Fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar, you remember that your brother has a grievance against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave your gift there before the altar, and go and make friends with your brother first, and then return and proceed to offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Come to terms without delay with your opponent while you are yet with him on the way to the court; for fear he should obtain judgement from the magistrate against you, and the magistrate should give you in custody to the officer and you be thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I solemnly tell you that you will certainly not be released till you have paid the very last farthing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»You have heard that it was said, `Thou shalt not commit adultery.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I tell you that whoever looks at a woman and cherishes lustful thoughts has already in his heart become guilty with regard to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If therefore your eye, even the right eye, is a snare to you, tear it out and away with it; it is better for you that one member should be destroyed rather than that your whole body should be thrown into Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand is a snare to you, cut it off and away with it; it is better for you that one member should be destroyed rather than that your whole body should go into Gehenna.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»It was also said, `If any man puts away his wife, let him give her a written notice of divorce.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I tell you that every man who puts away his wife except on the ground of unfaithfulness causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her when so divorced commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, `Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform thy vows to the Lord.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by Heaven, for it is God's throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>nor by the earth, for it is the footstool under His feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the City of the Great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your language be, `Yes, yes,' or `No, no.' Anything in excess of this comes from the Evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»You have heard that it was said, `Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I tell you not to resist a wicked man, but if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>If any one wishes to go to law with you and to deprive you of your under garment, let him take your outer one also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whoever shall compel you to convey his goods one mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>To him who asks, give: from him who would borrow, turn not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»You have heard that it was said, `Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I command you all, love your enemies, and pray for your persecutors;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>that so you may become true sons of your Father in Heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the wicked as well as the good, and sends rain upon those who do right and those who do wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you earned? Do not even the tax-gatherers do that?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you salute only your near relatives, what praise is due to you? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You however are to be complete in goodness, as your Heavenly Father is complete.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
