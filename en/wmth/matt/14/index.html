Then He took the five loaves and the two fish, and after looking up to heaven and blessing them, He broke up the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples distributed them to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So all ate, and were fully satisfied. The broken portions that remained over they gathered up, filling twelve baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Those who had eaten were about 5,000 adult men, without reckoning women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Immediately afterwards He made the disciples go on board the boat and cross to the opposite shore, leaving Him to dismiss the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When He had done this, He climbed the hill to pray in solitude. Night came on, and he was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Meanwhile the boat was far out on the Lake, buffeted and tossed by the waves, the wind being adverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But towards daybreak He went to them, walking over the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the disciples saw Him walking on the waves, they were greatly alarmed. »It is a spirit,« they exclaimed, and they cried out with terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But instantly Jesus spoke to them, and said, »There is no danger; it is I; do not be afraid.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Master,« answered Peter, »if it is you, bid me come to you upon the water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Come,« said Jesus. Then Peter climbed down from the boat and walked upon the water to go to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when he felt the wind he grew frightened, and beginning to sink he cried out, »Master, save me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Instantly Jesus stretched out His hand and caught hold of him, saying to him, »O little faith, why did you doubt?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they climbed into the boat, and the wind lulled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the men on board fell down before him and said, »You are indeed God's Son.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When they had quite crossed over, they put ashore at Gennesaret;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and the men of the place, recognizing Him, sent word into all the country round. So they brought all the sick to Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and they entreated Him that they might but touch the tassel of His outer garment; and all who did so were restored to perfect health.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
