If not, your peace shall return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whoever refuses to receive you or even to listen to your Message, as you leave that house or town, shake off the very dust from your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I solemnly tell you that it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of Judgement than for that town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Remember it is I who am sending you out, as sheep into the midst of wolves; prove yourselves as sagacious as serpents, and as innocent as doves.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But beware of men; for they will deliver you up to appear before Sanhedrins, and will flog you in their synagogues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and you will even be put on trial before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness to them and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when they have delivered you up, have no anxiety as to how you shall speak or what you shall say; for at that very time it shall be given you what to say;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for it is not you who will speak: it will be the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Brother will betray brother to death, and father, child; and children will rise against their own parents and will put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you will be objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name; but he who holds out to the End–he will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whenever they persecute you in one town, escape to the next; for I solemnly tell you that you will not have gone the round of all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»The learner is never superior to his teacher, and the servant is never superior to his master.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Enough for the learner to be on a level with his teacher, and for the servant to be on a level with his master.
