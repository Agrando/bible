A reed waving in the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man luxuriously dressed? Those who wear luxurious clothes are to be found in kings' palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is he of whom it is written, »`See I am sending My messenger before Thy face, and he will make Thy road ready before Thee.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I solemnly tell you that among all of woman born no greater has ever been raised up than John the Baptist; yet one who is of lower rank in the Kingdom of the Heavens is greater than he.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But from the time of John the Baptist till now, the Kingdom of the Heavens has been suffering violent assault, and the violent have been seizing it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the Prophets and the Law taught until John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And (if you are willing to receive it) he is the Elijah who was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Listen, every one who has ears!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»But to what shall I compare the present generation? It is like children sitting in the open places, who call to their playmates.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»`We have played the flute to you,' they say, `and you have not danced: we have sung dirges, and you have not beaten your breasts.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, `He has a demon.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they exclaim, `See this man! –given to gluttony and tippling, and a friend of tax-gatherers and notorious sinners!' And yet Wisdom is vindicated by her actions.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then began He to upbraid the towns where most of His mighty works had been done–because they had not repented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Alas for thee, Chorazin!« He cried. »Alas for thee, Bethsaida! For had the mighty works been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in both of you, they would long ere now have repented, covered with sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Only I tell you that it will be more endurable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of Judgement than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted even to Heaven? Even to Hades shalt thou descend. For had the mighty works been done in Sodom which have been done in thee, it would have remained until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only I tell you all, that it will be more endurable for the land of Sodom on the day of Judgement than for thee.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>About that time Jesus exclaimed, »I heartily praise Thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and of earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from sages and men of discernment, and hast unveiled them to babes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, Father, for such has been Thy gracious will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father, nor does any one fully know the Father except the Son and all to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Come to me, all you toiling and burdened ones, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke upon you and learn from me; for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For it is good to bear my yoke, and my burden is light.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
