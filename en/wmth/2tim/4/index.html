Call for Mark on your way and bring him with you, for he is a great help to me in my ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When you come, bring with you the cloak which I left behind at Troas at the house of Carpus, and the books, but especially the parchments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Alexander the metal-worker showed bitter hostility towards me: the Lord will requite him according to his doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You also should beware of him; for he has violently opposed our preaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At my first defence I had no one at my side, but all deserted me. May it not be laid to their charge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The Lord, however, stood by me and filled me with inward strength, that through me the Message might be fully proclaimed and that all the Gentiles might hear it; and I was rescued from the lion's jaws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord will deliver me from every cruel attack and will keep me safe in preparation for His heavenly Kingdom.

Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
