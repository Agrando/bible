Hymenaeus and Philetus are men of that stamp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the matter of the truth they have gone astray, saying that the Resurrection is already past, and so they are overthrowing the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet God's solid foundation stands unmoved, bearing this inscription, »The Lord knows those who really belong to Him.« And this also, »Let every one who names the Name of the Lord renounce all wickedness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now in a great house there are not only articles of gold and silver, but also others of wood and of earthenware; and some are for specially honourable, and others for common use.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If therefore a man keeps himself clear of these latter, he himself will be for specially honourable use, consecrated, fit for the Master's service, and fully equipped for every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Keep a strong curb, however, on your youthful cravings; and strive for integrity, good faith, love, peace, in company with all who pray to the Lord with pure hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But avoid foolish discussions with ignorant men, knowing –as you do– that these lead to quarrels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and a bondservant of the Lord must not quarrel, but must be inoffensive towards all men, a skilful teacher, and patient under wrongs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He must speak in a gentle tone when correcting the errors of opponents, in the hope that God will at last give them repentance, for them to come to a full knowledge of the truth</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and recover sober-mindedness and freedom from the Devil's snare, though they are now entrapped by him to do his will.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
