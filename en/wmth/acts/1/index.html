This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into Heaven will come in just the same way as you have seen Him going into Heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Oliveyard, which is near Jerusalem, about a mile off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They entered the city, and they went up to the upper room which was now their fixed place for meeting. Their names were Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All of these with one mind continued earnest in prayer, together with some women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and His brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It was on one of these days that Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren –the entire number of persons present being about 120– and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled–the prediction, I mean, which the Holy Spirit uttered by the lips of David, about Judas, who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Judas was reckoned as one of our number, and a share in this ministry was allotted to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now having bought a piece of ground with the money paid for his wickedness he fell there with his face downwards, and, his body bursting open, he became disembowelled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This fact became widely known to the people of Jerusalem, so that the place received the name, in their language, of Achel-damach, which means `The Field of Blood.')</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»For it is written in the Book of Psalms,« `Let his encampment be desolate: let there be no one to dwell there'; and `His work let another take up.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»It is necessary, therefore, that of the men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from His baptism by John down to the day on which He was taken up again from us into Heaven–one should be appointed to become a witness with us as to His resurrection.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So two names were proposed, Joseph called Bar-sabbas –and surnamed Justus– and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the brethren prayed, saying, »Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, show clearly which of these two Thou hast chosen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to occupy the place in this ministry and Apostleship from which Judas through transgression fell, in order to go to his own place.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they drew lots between them. The lot fell on Matthias, and a place among the eleven Apostles was voted to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
