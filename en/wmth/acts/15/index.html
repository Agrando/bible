Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will set it up again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In order that the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord–even all the nations which are called by My name,«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Says the Lord, who has been making these things known from ages long past.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»My judgement, therefore, is against inflicting unexpected annoyance on those of the Gentiles who are turning to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet let us send them written instructions to abstain from things polluted by connexion with idolatry, from fornication, from meat killed by strangling, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Moses from the earliest times has had his preachers in every town, being read, as he is, Sabbath after Sabbath, in the various synagogues.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thereupon it was decided by the Apostles and Elders, with the approval of the whole Church, to choose suitable persons from among themselves and send them to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas. Judas, called Bar-sabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren, were selected,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they took with them the following letter: »The Apostles and the elder brethren send greeting to the Gentile brethren throughout Antioch, Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As we have been informed that certain persons who have gone out from among us have disturbed you by their teaching and have unsettled your minds, without having received any such instructions from us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>we have unanimously decided to select certain men and send them to you in company with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>who have endangered their very lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who are themselves bringing you the same message by word of mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no burden heavier than these necessary requirements–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You must abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. Keep yourselves clear of these things, and it will be well with you. Farewell.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They, therefore, having been solemnly sent, came down to Antioch, where they called together the whole assembly and delivered the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The people read it, and were delighted with the comfort it brought them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Judas and Silas, being themselves also Prophets, gave them a long and encouraging talk, and strengthened them in the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>After spending some time there they received an affectionate farewell from the brethren to return to those who had sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and, in company with many others, telling the Good News of the Lord's Message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>After a while Paul said to Barnabas, »Suppose we now revisit the brethren in the various towns in which we have made known the Lord's Message–to see whether they are prospering!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Barnabas, however, was bent on taking with them John, whose other name was Mark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>while Paul deemed it undesirable to have as their companion one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So there arose a serious disagreement between them, which resulted in their parting from one another, Barnabas taking Mark and setting sail for Cyprus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Paul chose Silas as his travelling companion; and set out, after being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and he passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the Churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
