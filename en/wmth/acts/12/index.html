Then the angel said, »Throw your cloak round you, and follow me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Peter went out, following him, yet could not believe that what the angel was doing was real, but supposed that he saw a vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And passing through the first ward and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. This opened to them of itself; and, going out, they passed on through one of the streets, and then suddenly the angel left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Peter coming to himself said, »Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel and has rescued me from the power of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were anticipating.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So, after thinking things over, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark, where a large number of people were assembled, praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he knocked at the wicket in the door, a maidservant named Rhoda came to answer the knock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and recognizing Peter's voice, for very joy she did not open the door, but ran in and told them that Peter was standing there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»You are mad,« they said. But she strenuously maintained that it was true. »It is his guardian angel,« they said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, until at last they opened the door and saw that it was really he, and were filled with amazement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he motioned with his hand for silence, and then described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. »Tell all this to James and the brethren,« he added. Then he left them, and went to another place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When morning came, there was no little commotion among the soldiers, as to what could possibly have become of Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when Herod had had him searched for and could not find him, after sharply questioning the guards he ordered them away to execution. He then went down from Judaea to Caesarea and remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the people of Tyre and Sidon had incurred Herod's violent displeasure. So they sent a large deputation to wait on him; and having secured the good will of Blastus, his treasurer, they begged the king to be friendly with them again, because their country was dependent on his for its food supply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So, on an appointed day, Herod, having arrayed himself in royal robes, took his seat on the tribunal, and was haranguing them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the assembled people kept shouting, »It is the voice of a god, and not of a man!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he had not given the glory to God, and being eaten up by worms, he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But God's Message prospered, and converts were multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having discharged their mission, and they brought with them John, surnamed Mark.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
