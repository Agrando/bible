It is on the subject of this hope, Sir, that I am accused by the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why is it deemed with all of you a thing past belief if God raises the dead to life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»I myself, however, thought it a duty to do many things in hostility to the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And that was how I acted in Jerusalem. Armed with authority received from the High Priests I shut up many of God's people in various prisons, and when they were about to be put to death I gave my vote against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In all the synagogues also I punished them many a time, and tried to make them blaspheme; and in my wild fury I chased them even to foreign towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»While thus engaged, I was travelling one day to Damascus armed with authority and a commission from the High Priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and on the journey, at noon, Sir, I saw a light from Heaven –brighter than the brightness of the sun– shining around me and around those who were travelling with me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We all fell to the ground; and I heard a voice which said to me in Hebrew, »`Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? You are finding it painful to kick against the ox-goad.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»`Who art Thou, Lord?' I asked.« `I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`But rise, and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you My servant and My witness both as to the things you have already seen and as to those in which I will appear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will save you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you to open their eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that they may turn from darkness to light and from the obedience to Satan to God, in order to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified through faith in Me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but I proceeded to preach first to the people in Damascus, and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judaea, and to the Gentiles, that they must repent and turn to God, and live lives consistent with such repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»It was on this account that the Jews seized me in the Temple and tried to kill me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Having, however, obtained the help which is from God, I have stood firm until now, and have solemnly exhorted rich and poor alike, saying nothing except what the Prophets and Moses predicted as soon to happen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>since the Christ was to be a suffering Christ, and by coming back from the dead was then to be the first to proclaim a message of light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As Paul thus made his defence, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice, »You are raving mad, Paul; and great learning is driving you mad.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I am not mad, most noble Festus,« replied Paul; »I am speaking words of sober truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the King, to whom I speak freely, knows about these matters. I am not to be persuaded that any detail of them has escaped his notice; for these things have not been done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you believe them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Agrippa answered, »In brief, you are doing your best to persuade me to become a Christian.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»My prayer to God, whether briefly or at length,« replied Paul, »would be that not only you but all who are my hearers to-day, might become such as I am–except these chains.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the King rose, and the Governor, and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and, having withdrawn, they talked to one another and said, »This man is doing nothing for which he deserves death or imprisonment.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, »He might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
