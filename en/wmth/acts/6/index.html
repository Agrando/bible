At length they came upon him, seized him with violence, and took him before the Sanhedrin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Here they brought forward false witnesses who declared, »This fellow is incessantly speaking against the Holy Place and the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we have heard him say that Jesus, the Nazarene, will pull this place down to the ground and will change the customs which Moses handed down to us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>At once the eyes of all who were sitting in the Sanhedrin were fastened on him, and they saw his face looking just like the face of an angel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
