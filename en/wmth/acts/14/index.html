He had been lame from his birth and had never walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this man had listened to one of Paul's sermons, the Apostle, looking steadily at him and perceiving that he had faith to be cured,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>said in a loud voice, »Stand upright upon your feet!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So he sprang up and began to walk about. Then the crowds, seeing what Paul had done, rent the air with their shouts in the Lycaonian language, saying, »The gods have assumed human form and have come down to us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They called Barnabas `Zeus,' and Paul, as being the principal speaker, `Hermes.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest of Zeus –the temple of Zeus being at the entrance to the city– brought bullocks and garlands to the gates, and in company with the crowd was intending to offer sacrifices to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it; and tearing their clothes they rushed out into the middle of the crowd, exclaiming, »Sirs, why are you doing all this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We also are but men, with natures kindred to your own; and we bring you the Good News that you are to turn from these unreal things, to worship the ever-living God, the Creator of earth and sky and sea and of everything that is in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In times gone by He allowed all the nations to go their own ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and yet by His beneficence He has not left His existence unattested–His beneficence, I mean, in sending you rain from Heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and joyfulness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even with words like these they had difficulty in preventing the thronging crowd from offering sacrifices to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But now a party of Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and, having won over the crowd, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, believing him to be dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When, however, the disciples had collected round him, he rose and went back into the town. The next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and, after proclaiming the Good News to the people there and gaining a large number of converts, they retraced their steps to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Everywhere they strengthened the disciples by encouraging them to hold fast to the faith, and warned them saying, »It is through many afflictions that we must make our way into the Kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in every Church, after prayer and fasting, they selected Elders by show of hands, and commended them to the Lord on whom their faith rested.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then passing through Pisidia they came into Pamphylia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and after telling the Message at Perga they came down to Attaleia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thence they sailed to Antioch, where they had previously been commended to the grace of God in connexion with the work which they had now completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Upon their arrival they called the Church together and proceeded to report in detail all that God, working with them, had done, and how He had opened for the Gentiles the door of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they remained a considerable time in Antioch with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
