This filled the whole house where they were sitting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and they saw tongues of what looked like fire distributing themselves over the assembly, and on the head of each person a tongue alighted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in foreign languages according as the Spirit gave them words to utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every part of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So when this noise was heard, they came crowding together, and were amazed because everyone heard his own language spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They were beside themselves with wonder, and exclaimed, »Are not all these speakers Galilaeans?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How then does each of us hear his own native language spoken by them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some of us are Parthians, Medes, Elamites. Some are inhabitants of Mesopotamia, of Judaea or Cappadocia, of Pontus or the Asian Province, of Phrygia or Pamphylia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of Egypt or of the parts of Africa towards Cyrene. Others are visitors from Rome –being either Jews or converts from heathenism– and others are Cretans or Arabians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yet we all alike hear these Galilaeans speaking in our own language about the wonderful things which God has done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They were all astounded and bewildered, and asked one another, »What can this mean?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But others, scornfully jeering, said, »They are brim-full of sweet wine.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Peter however, together with the Eleven, stood up and addressed them in a loud voice. »Men of Judaea, and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem,« he said, »be in no uncertainty about this matter but pay attention to what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this is not intoxication, as you suppose, it being only the third hour of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But that which was predicted through the Prophet Joel has happened:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall come to pass in the last days, God says, that I will pour out My Spirit upon all mankind; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall have dreams;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and even upon My bondservants, both men and women, at that time, I will pour out My Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will display marvels in the sky above, and signs on the earth below, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, to usher in the day of the Lord– that great and illustrious day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and every one who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Listen, Israelites, to what I say. Jesus, the Nazarene, a man accredited to you from God by miracles and marvels and signs which God did among you through Him, as you yourselves know, Him–«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>delivered up through God's settled purpose and foreknowledge–you by the hands of Gentiles have nailed to a cross and have put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But God has raised Him to life, having terminated the throes of death, for in fact it was not possible for Him to be held fast by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says in reference to Him, »`I constantly fixed my eyes upon the Lord, because He is at my right hand in order that I may continue unshaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this reason my heart is glad and my tongue exults. My body also shall rest in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For Thou wilt not leave me in the Unseen World forsaken, nor give up Thy holy One to undergo decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou hast made known to me the ways of Life: Thou wilt fill me with gladness in Thy presence.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»As to the patriarch David, I need hardly remind you, brethren, that he died and was buried, and that we still have his tomb among us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Being a Prophet, however, and knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to seat a descendant of his upon his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>with prophetic foresight he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, to the effect that He was not left forsaken in the Unseen World, nor did His body undergo decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus, God has raised to life– a fact to which all of us testify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Being therefore lifted high by the mighty hand of God, He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out this which you see and hear.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not ascend into Heaven, but he says himself, »`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>until I make thy foes a footstool under thy feet.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Therefore let the whole House of Israel know beyond all doubt that God has made Him both LORD and CHRIST–this Jesus whom you crucified.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Stung to the heart by these words, they said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles, »Brethren, what are we to do?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Repent,« replied Peter, »and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, with a view to the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For to you belongs the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, whoever the Lord our God may call.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many more appeals he solemnly warned and entreated them, saying, »Escape from this crooked generation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Those, therefore, who joyfully welcomed his Message were baptized; and on that one day about three thousand persons were added to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they were constant in listening to the teaching of the Apostles and in their attendance at the Communion, that is, the Breaking of the Bread, and at prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Fear came upon every one, and many marvels and signs were done by the Apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all the believers kept together, and had everything in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They sold their lands and other property, and distributed the proceeds among all, according to every one's necessities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And, day by day, attending constantly in the Temple with one accord, and breaking bread in private houses, they took their meals with great happiness and single-heartedness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God and being regarded with favour by all the people. Also, day by day, the Lord added to their number those whom He was saving.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
