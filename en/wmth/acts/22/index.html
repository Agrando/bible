I was carefully trained at the feet of Gamaliel in the Law of our forefathers, and, like all of you to-day, was zealous for God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I persecuted to death this new faith, continually binding both men and women and throwing them into prison;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>as the High Priest also and all the Elders can bear me witness. It was, too, from them that I received letters to the brethren in Damascus, and I was already on my way to Damascus, intending to bring those also who had fled there, in chains to Jerusalem, to be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»But on my way, when I was now not far from Damascus, about noon a sudden blaze of light from Heaven shone round me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, »`Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»`Who art thou, Lord?' I asked.« `I am Jesus, the Nazarene,' He replied, `whom you are persecuting.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Now the men who were with me, though they saw the light, did not hear the words of Him who spoke to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I asked, »`What am I to do, Lord?' «And the Lord said to me, »`Rise, and go into Damascus. There you shall be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»And as I could not see because the light had been so dazzling, those who were with me had to lead me by the arm, and so I came to Damascus.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»And a certain Ananias, a pious man who obeyed the Law and bore a good character with all the Jews of the city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>came to me and standing at my side said, »`Brother Saul, recover your sight.'« I instantly regained my sight and looked up at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he said, `The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the righteous One and hear Him speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you shall be a witness for Him, to all men, of what you have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now why delay? Rise, get yourself baptized, and wash off your sins, calling upon His name.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»After my return to Jerusalem, and while praying in the Temple, I fell into a trance.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I saw Jesus, and He said to me, »`Make haste and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»`Lord,' I replied, `they themselves well know how active I was in imprisoning, and in flogging in synagogue after synagogue those who believe in Thee;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and when they were shedding the blood of Stephen, Thy witness, I was standing by, fully approving of it, and I held the clothes of those who were killing him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»`Go,' He replied; `I will send you as an Apostle to nations far away.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Until they heard this last statement the people listened to Paul, but now with a roar of disapproval they cried out, »Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought not to be allowed to live.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they continued their furious shouts, throwing their clothes into the air and flinging dust about,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the Tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and be examined by flogging, in order to ascertain the reason why they thus cried out against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But, when they had tied him up with the straps, Paul said to the Captain who stood by, »Does the Law permit you to flog a Roman citizen–and one too who is uncondemned?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On hearing this question, the Captain went to report the matter to the Tribune. »What are you intending to do?« he said. »This man is a Roman citizen.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the Tribune came to Paul and asked him, »Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?«»Yes,« he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»I paid a large sum for my citizenship,« said the Tribune. »But I was born free,« said Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So the men who had been on the point of putting him under torture immediately left him. And the Tribune, too, was frightened when he learnt that Paul was a Roman citizen, for he had had him bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The next day, wishing to know exactly what charge was being brought against him by the Jews, the Tribune ordered his chains to be removed; and, having sent word to the High Priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble, he brought Paul down and made him stand before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
