We belong neither to the night nor to darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So then let us not sleep, like the rest of the world, but let us keep awake and be sober.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who drink freely, drink at night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But let us, belonging –as we do– to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For God has not pre-destined us to meet His anger, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who died on our behalf, so that whether we are awake or are sleeping we may share His Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore encourage one another, and let each one help to strengthen his friend, as in fact you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we beg you, brethren, to show respect for those who labour among you and are your leaders in Christian work, and are your advisers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the unruly, comfort the timid, sustain the weak, and be patient towards all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See to it that no one ever repays another with evil for evil; but always seek opportunities of doing good both to one another and to all the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be always joyful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be unceasing in prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In every circumstance of life be thankful; for this is God's will in Christ Jesus respecting you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not quench the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not think meanly of utterances of prophecy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but test all such, and retain hold of the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hold yourselves aloof from every form of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And may God Himself who gives peace, make you entirely holy; and may your spirits, souls and bodies be preserved complete and be found blameless at the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Faithful is He who calls you, and He will also perfect His work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Brethren, pray for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I solemnly charge you in the Lord's name to have this Letter read to all the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
