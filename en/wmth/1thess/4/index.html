For the Lord is an avenger in all such cases, as we have already taught you and solemnly warned you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>God has not called us to an unclean life, but to one of purity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore a defiant spirit in such a case provokes not man but God, who puts His Holy Spirit into your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But on the subject of love for the brotherhood it is unnecessary for me to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and indeed you do love all the brethren throughout Macedonia. And we exhort you to do so more and more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and to vie with one another in eagerness for peace, every one minding his own business and working with his hands, as we ordered you to do:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so as to live worthy lives in relation to outsiders, and not be a burden to any one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now, concerning those who from time to time pass away, we would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, lest you should mourn as others do who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if we believe that Jesus has died and risen again, we also believe that, through Jesus, God will bring with Him those who shall have passed away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this we declare to you on the Lord's own authority–that we who are alive and continue on earth until the Coming of the Lord, shall certainly not forestall those who shall have previously passed away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord Himself will come down from Heaven with a loud word of command, and with an archangel's voice and the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Afterwards we who are alive and are still on earth will be caught up in their company amid clouds to meet the Lord in the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And so we shall be with the Lord for ever. Therefore encourage one another with these words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
