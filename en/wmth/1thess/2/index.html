They are displeasing to God, and are the enemies of all mankind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for they still try to prevent our preaching to the Gentiles so that they may find salvation. They thus continually fill up the measure of their own sins, and God's anger in its severest form has overtaken them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But we, brethren, having been for a short time separated from you in bodily presence, though not in heart, endeavoured all the more earnestly, with intense longing, to see you face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On this account we wanted to come to you –at least I Paul wanted again and again to do so– but Satan hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what is our hope or joy, or the crown of which we boast? Is it not you yourselves in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His Coming?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yes, you are our glory and our joy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
