Blessings on him who comes in the name of the Lord–even on the King of Israel!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus, having procured a young ass, sat upon it, just as the Scripture says,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Fear not, Daughter of Zion! See, thy King is coming riding on an ass's colt.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The meaning of this His disciples did not understand at the time; but after Jesus was glorified they recollected that this was written about Him, and that they had done this to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The large number of people, however, who had been present when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and brought him back to life, related what they had witnessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This was also why the crowd came to meet Him, because they had heard of His having performed that miracle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The result was that the Pharisees said among themselves, »Observe how idle all your efforts are! The world is gone after him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now some of those who used to come up to worship at the Festival were Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They came to Philip, of Bethsaida in Galilee, with the request, »Sir, we wish to see Jesus.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip came and told Andrew: Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His answer was, »The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In most solemn truth I tell you that unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains what it was–a single grain; but that if it dies, it yields a rich harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who holds his life dear, is destroying it; and he who makes his life of no account in this world shall keep it to the Life of the Ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If a man wishes to be my servant, let him follow me; and where I am, there too shall my servant be. If a man wishes to be my servant, the Father will honour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now is my soul full of trouble; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this purpose I have come to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify Thy name.« Thereupon there came a voice from the sky, »I have glorified it and will also glorify it again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The crowd that stood by and heard it, said that there had been thunder. Others said, »An angel spoke to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»It is not for my sake,« said Jesus, »that that voice came, but for your sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is a judgement of this world: now will the Prince of this world be driven out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I – if I am lifted up from the earth– will draw all men to me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said this to indicate the kind of death He would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The crowd answered Him, »We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains for ever. In what sense do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is that Son of Man?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Yet a little while,« He replied, »the light is among you. Be faithful to the light that you have, for fear darkness should overtake you; for a man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>In the degree that you have light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light.« Jesus said this, and went away and hid Himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But though He had performed such great miracles in their presence, they did not believe in Him–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>in order that the words of Isaiah the Prophet might be fulfilled, »Lord, who has believed our preaching? And the arm of the Lord–to whom has it been unveiled?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For this reason they were unable to believe–because Isaiah said again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»He has blinded their eyes and made their minds callous, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their minds, and should turn, and I should heal them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah uttered these words because he saw His glory; and he spoke of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless even from among the Rulers many believed in Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not avow their belief, for fear they should be shut out from the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For they loved the glory that comes from men rather than the glory that comes from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But Jesus cried aloud, »He who believes in me, believes not so much in me, as in Him who sent me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and he who sees me sees Him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come like light into the world, in order that no one who believes in me may remain in the dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if any one hears my teachings and regards them not, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who sets me at naught and does not receive my teachings is not left without a judge: the Message which I have spoken will judge him on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me, Himself gave me a command what to say and in what words to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that His command is the Life of the Ages. What therefore I speak, I speak just as the Father has bidden me.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
