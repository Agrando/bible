And no sooner had the President tasted the water now turned into wine, than –not knowing where it came from, though the attendants who had drawn the water knew– he called to the bridegroom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said to him, »It is usual to put on the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then that which is inferior. But you have kept the good wine till now.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This, the first of His miracles, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and thus displayed His glorious power; and His disciples believed in Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Afterwards He went down to Capernaum–He, and His mother, and His brothers, and His disciples; and they made a short stay there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the Jewish Passover was approaching, and for this Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He found in the Temple the dealers in cattle and sheep and in pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So He plaited a whip of rushes, and drove all –both sheep and bullocks– out of the Temple. The small coin of the brokers He upset on the ground and overturned their tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to the pigeon-dealers He said, »Take these things away. Do not turn my Father's house into a market.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This recalled to His disciples the words of Scripture, »My zeal for Thy House will consume me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the Jews asked Him, »What proof of your authority do you exhibit to us, seeing that you do these things?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Demolish this Sanctuary,« said Jesus, »and in three days I will rebuild it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»It has taken forty-six years,« replied the Jews, »to build this Sanctuary, and will you rebuild it in three days?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But He was speaking of the Sanctuary of His body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When however He had risen from among the dead, His disciples recollected that He had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the teaching which Jesus had given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when He was in Jerusalem, at the Festival of the Passover, many became believers in Him through watching the miracles He performed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But for His part, Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and did not need any one's testimony concerning a man, for He of Himself knew what was in the man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
