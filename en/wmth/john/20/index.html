There on the ground he saw the cloths;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the towel, which had been placed over the face of Jesus, not lying with the cloths, but folded up and put by itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the other disciple, who had been the first to come to the tomb, also went in and saw and was convinced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For until now they had not understood the inspired teaching, that He must rise again from among the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then they went away and returned home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Meanwhile Mary remained standing near the tomb, weeping aloud. She did not enter the tomb, but as she wept she stooped and looked in,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and saw two angels clothed in white raiment, sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They spoke to her. »Why are you weeping?« they asked. »Because,« she replied, »they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>While she was speaking, she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, but did not recognize Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Why are you weeping?« He asked; »who are you looking for?« She, supposing that He was the gardener, replied, »Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him and I will remove him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Mary!« said Jesus. She turned to Him. »Rabboni!« she cried in Hebrew: the word means `Teacher!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Do not cling to me,« said Jesus, »for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But take this message to my brethren: `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary of Magdala came and brought word to the disciples. »I have seen the Master,« she said. And she told them that He had said these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>On that same first day of the week, when it was evening and, for fear of the Jews, the doors of the house where the disciples were, were locked, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and said to them, »Peace be to you!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Having said this He showed them His hands and also His side; and the disciples were filled with joy at seeing the Master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A second time, therefore, He said to them, »Peace be to you! As the Father sent me, I also now send you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Having said this He breathed upon them and said, »Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you remit the sins of any persons, they remain remitted to them. If you bind fast the sins of any, they remain bound.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thomas, one of the twelve –surnamed `the Twin'– was not among them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the rest of the disciples told him, »We have seen the Master!« His reply was, »Unless I see in his hands the wound made by the nails and put my finger into the wound, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them, when Jesus came –though the doors were locked– and stood in their midst, and said, »Peace be to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He said to Thomas, »Bring your finger here and feel my hands; bring you hand and put it into my side; and do not be ready to disbelieve but to believe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»My Lord and my God!« replied Thomas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Because you have seen me,« replied Jesus, »you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There were also a great number of other signs which Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But these have been recorded in order that you may believe that He is the Christ, the Son of God, and that, through believing, you may have Life through His name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
