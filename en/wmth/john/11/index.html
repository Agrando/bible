But let us go to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Let us go also,« Thomas, the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, »that we may die with him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On His arrival Jesus found that Lazarus had already been three days in the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Bethany was near Jerusalem, the distance being a little less than two miles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and a considerable number of the Jews were with Martha and Mary, having come to express sympathy with them on the death of their brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Martha, however, as soon as she heard the tidings, »Jesus is coming,« went to meet Him; but Mary remained sitting in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Martha came and spoke to Jesus. »Master, if you had been here,« she said, »my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And even now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Your brother shall rise again,« replied Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»I know,« said Martha, »that he will rise again at the resurrection, on the last day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I am the Resurrection and the Life,« said Jesus; »he who believes in me, even if he has died, he shall live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and every one who is living and is a believer in me shall never, never die. Do you believe this?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»Yes, Master,« she replied; »I thoroughly believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After saying this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, telling her, »The Rabbi is here and is asking for you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So she, on hearing that, rose up quickly to go to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the Jews who were with Mary in the house sympathizing with her, when they saw that she had risen hastily and had gone out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep aloud there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Mary then, when she came to Jesus and saw Him, fell at His feet and exclaimed, »Master, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Seeing her weeping aloud, and the Jews in like manner weeping who had come with her, Jesus, curbing the strong emotion of His spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>though deeply troubled, asked them, »Where have you laid him?«»Master, come and see,« was their reply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»See how dear he held him,« said the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But others of them asked, »Was this man who opened the blind man's eyes unable to prevent this man from dying?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus, however, again restraining His strong feeling, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone had been laid against the mouth of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Take away the stone,« said Jesus. Martha, the sister of the dead man, exclaimed, »Master, by this time there is a foul smell; for it is three days since he died.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»Did I not promise you,« replied Jesus, »that if you believe, you shall see the glory of God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they removed the stone. Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, »Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I know that Thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the crowd standing round I have said this–that they may believe that Thou didst send me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After speaking thus, He called out in a loud voice, »Lazarus, come out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped in cloths, and his face wrapped round with a towel. »Untie him,« said Jesus, »and let him go free.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thereupon a considerable number of the Jews– namely those who had come to Mary and had witnessed His deeds– became believers in Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>though some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what He had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore the High Priests and the Pharisees held a meeting of the Sanhedrin. »What steps are we taking?« they asked one another; »for this man is performing a great number of miracles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we leave him alone in this way, everybody will believe in him, and the Romans will come and blot out both our city and our nation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But one of them, named Caiaphas, being High Priest that year, said, »You know nothing about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>You do not reflect that it is to your interest that one man should die for the people rather than the whole nation perish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>It was not as a mere man that he thus spoke. But being High Priest that year he was inspired to declare that Jesus was to die for the nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not for the nation only, but in order to unite into one body all the far-scattered children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So from that day forward they planned and schemed in order to put Him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Therefore Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but He left that neighbourhood and went into the district near the Desert, to a town called Ephraim, and remained there with the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The Jewish Passover was coming near, and many from that district went up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They therefore looked out for Jesus, and asked one another as they stood in the Temple, »What do you think? –will he come to the Festival at all?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now the High Priests and the Pharisees had issued orders that if any one knew where He was, he should give information, so that they might arrest Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
