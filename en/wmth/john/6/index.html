The ground was covered with thick grass; so they sat down, the adult men numbering about 5,000.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks He distributed them to those who were resting on the ground; and also the fish in like manner–as much as they desired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When all were fully satisfied, He said to His disciples, »Gather up the broken portions that remain over, so that nothing be lost.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Accordingly they gathered them up; and with the fragments of the five barley loaves –the broken portions that remained over after they had done eating– they filled twelve baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thereupon the people, having seen the miracle He had performed, said, »This is indeed the Prophet who was to come into the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Perceiving, however, that they were about to come and carry Him off by force to make Him a king, Jesus withdrew again up the hill alone by Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When evening came on, His disciples went down to the Lake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>There they got on board a boat, and pushed off to cross the Lake to Capernaum. By this time it had become dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lake also was getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When, however, they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the water and coming near the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They were terrified; but He called to them. »It is I,« He said, »do not be afraid.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they were willing to take Him on board; and in a moment the boat reached the shore at the point to which they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Next morning the crowd who were still standing about on the other side of the Lake found that there had been but one small boat there, and they had seen that Jesus did not go on board with His disciples, but that His disciples went away without Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet a number of small boats came from Tiberias to the neighbourhood of the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When however the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they themselves also took boats and came to Capernaum to look for Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So when they had crossed the Lake and had found Him, they asked Him, »Rabbi, when did you come here?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that you are searching for me not because you have seen miracles, but because you ate the loaves and had a hearty meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Bestow your pains not on the food which perishes, but on the food that remains unto the Life of the Ages–that food which will be the Son of Man's gift to you; for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»What are we to do,« they asked, »in order to carry out the things that God requires?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»This,« replied Jesus, »is above all the thing that God requires–that you should be believers in Him whom He has sent.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»What miracle then,« they asked, »do you perform for us to see and become believers in you? What do you do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, as it is written, `He gave them bread out of Heaven to eat'.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that Moses did not give you the bread out of Heaven, but my Father is giving you the bread –the true bread– out of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God's bread is that which comes down out of Heaven and gives Life to the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Sir,« they said, »always give us that bread.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»I am the bread of Life,« replied Jesus; »he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never, never thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But it is as I have said to you: you have seen me and yet you do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Every one whom the Father gives me will come to me, and him who comes to me I will never on any account drive away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I have left Heaven and have come down to earth not to seek my own pleasure, but to do the will of Him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And this is the will of Him who sent me, that of all that He has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it to life on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For this is my Father's will, that every one who fixes his gaze on the Son of God and believes in Him should have the Life of the Ages, and I will raise him to life on the last day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now the Jews began to find fault about Him because of His claiming to be the bread which came down out of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They kept asking, »Is not this man Joseph's son? Is he not Jesus, whose father and mother we know? What does he mean by now saying, `I have come down out of Heaven'?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>»Do not thus find fault among yourselves,« replied Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; then I will raise him to life on the last day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It stands written in the Prophets, `And they shall all of them be taught by God'. Every one who listens to the Father and learns from Him comes to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>No one has ever seen the Father–except Him who is from God. He has seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>»In most solemn truth I tell you that he who believes has the Life of the Ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, and they died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Here is the bread that comes down out of Heaven that a man may eat it and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the living bread come down out of Heaven. If a man eats this bread, he shall live for ever. Moreover the bread which I will give is my flesh given for the life of the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>This led to an angry debate among the Jews. »How can this man,« they argued, »give us his flesh to eat?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« said Jesus, »that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no Life in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has the Life of the Ages, and I will raise him up on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I remain in union with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As the ever-living Father has sent me, and I live because of the Father, so also he who eats me will live because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread which came down out of Heaven; it is unlike that which your forefathers ate–for they ate and yet died. He who eats this bread shall live for ever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Jesus said all this in the synagogue while teaching at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard it, said, »This is hard to accept. Who can listen to such teaching?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But, knowing in Himself that His disciples were dissatisfied about it, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>»Does this seem incredible to you? What then if you were to see the Son of Man ascending again where He was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the spirit which gives Life. The flesh confers no benefit whatever. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and are Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you who do not believe.« For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>So He added, »That is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Thereupon many of His disciples left Him and went away, and no longer associated with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Jesus therefore appealed to the Twelve. »Will you go also?« He asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>»Master,« replied Simon Peter, »to whom shall we go? Your teachings tell us of the Life of the Ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And we have come to believe and know that you are indeed the Holy One of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>»Did not I choose you–the Twelve?« said Jesus, »and even of you one is a devil.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He alluded to Judas, the son of Simon the Iscariot. For he it was who, though one of the Twelve, was afterwards to betray Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
