(Now Judas who was betraying Him was also standing with them.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As soon then as He said to them, »I am he,« they went backwards and fell to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Again therefore He asked them, »Who are you looking for?«»For Jesus the Nazarene,« they said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I have told you,« replied Jesus, »that I am he. If therefore you are looking for me, let these my disciples go their way.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He made this request in order that the words He had spoken might be fulfilled, »As for those whom Thou hast given me, I have not lost one.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Simon Peter, however, having a sword, drew it, and, aiming at the High Priest's servant, cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus therefore said to Peter, »Put back your sword. Shall I refuse to drink the cup of sorrow which the Father has given me to drink?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the battalion and their tribune and the Jewish police closed in, and took Jesus and bound Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They then brought Him to Annas first; for Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(It was this Caiaphas who had advised the Jews, saying, »It is to your interest that one man should die for the People.«)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Meanwhile Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so also was another disciple. The latter was known to the High Priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the High Priest's palace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Peter remained standing outside the door, till the disciple who was acquainted with the High Priest came out and induced the portress to let Peter in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This led the girl, the portress, to ask Peter, »Are you also one of this man's disciples?«»No, I am not,« he replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now because it was cold the servants and the police had lighted a charcoal fire, and were standing and warming themselves; and Peter too remained with them, standing and warming himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the High Priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»As for me,« replied Jesus, »I have spoken openly to the world. I have continually taught in some synagogue or in the Temple where all the Jews are wont to assemble, and I have said nothing in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why do you question me? Question those who heard what it was I said to them: these witnesses here know what I said.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Upon His saying this, one of the officers standing by struck Him with his open hand, asking Him as he did so, »Is that the way you answer the High Priest?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»If I have spoken wrongly,« replied Jesus, »bear witness to it as wrong; but if rightly, why that blow?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Simon Peter remained standing and warming himself, and this led to their asking him, »Are you also one of his disciples?« He denied it, and said, »No, I am not.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the High Priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, »Did I not see you in the garden with him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Once more Peter denied it, and immediately a cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So they brought Jesus from Caiaphas's house to the Praetorium. It was the early morning, and they would not enter the Praetorium themselves for fear of defilement, and in order that they might be able to eat the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Accordingly Pilate came out to them and inquired, »What accusation have you to bring against this man?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»If the man were not a criminal,« they replied, »we would not have handed him over to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Take him yourselves,« said Pilate, »and judge him by your Law.«»We have no power,« replied the Jews, »to put any man to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They said this that the words might be fulfilled in which Jesus predicted the kind of death He was to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Re-entering the Praetorium, therefore, Pilate called Jesus and asked Him, »Are you the King of the Jews?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Do you say this of yourself, or have others told it you about me?« replied Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>»Am I a Jew?« exclaimed Pilate; »it is your own nation and the High Priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»My kingdom,« replied Jesus, »does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my subjects would have resolutely fought to save me from being delivered up to the Jews. But, as a matter of fact, my kingdom has not this origin.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»So then you are a king!« rejoined Pilate. »Yes,« said Jesus, »you say truly that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world–to give testimony for the truth. Every one who is a friend of the truth listens to my voice.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»What is truth?« said Pilate. But no sooner had he spoken the words than he went out again to the Jews and told them, »I find no crime in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But you have a custom that I should release one prisoner to you at the Passover. So shall I release to you the King of the Jews?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>With a roar of voices they again cried out, saying, »Not this man, but Barabbas!« Now Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
