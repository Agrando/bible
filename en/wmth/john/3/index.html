Can he a second time enter his mother's womb and be born?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whatever has been born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever has been born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not be astonished at my telling you, `You must all be born anew.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So is it with every one who has been born of the Spirit.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»How is all this possible?« asked Nicodemus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Are you,« replied Jesus, »`the Teacher of Israel,' and yet do you not understand these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In most solemn truth I tell you that we speak what we know, and give testimony of that of which we were eye-witnesses, and yet you all reject our testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I have told you earthly things and none of you believe me, how will you believe me if I tell you of things in Heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is no one who has gone up to Heaven, but there is One who has come down from Heaven, namely the Son of Man whose home is in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And just as Moses lifted high the serpent in the Desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>in order that every one who trusts in Him may have the Life of the Ages.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For so greatly did God love the world that He gave His only Son, that every one who trusts in Him may not perish but may have the Life of Ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who trusts in Him does not come up for judgement. He who does not trust has already received sentence, because he has not his trust resting on the name of God's only Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the test by which men are judged–the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than they loved the Light, because their deeds were wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For every wrongdoer hates the light, and does not come to the light, for fear his actions should be exposed and condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he who does what is honest and right comes to the light, in order that his actions may be plainly shown to have been done in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After this Jesus and His disciples went into Judaea; and there He made a stay in company with them and baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And John too was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there were many pools of water there; and people came and received baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>(For John was not yet in prison.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As the result, a discussion having arisen on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>they came to John and reported to him, »Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan and to whom you bore testimony is now baptizing, and great numbers of people are resorting to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»A man cannot obtain anything,« replied John, »unless it has been granted to him from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves can bear witness to my having said, `I am not the Christ,' but `I am His appointed forerunner.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; and the bridegroom's friend who stands by his side and listens to him, rejoices heartily on account of the bridegroom's happiness. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He must grow greater, but I must grow less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He who comes from above is above all. He whose origin is from the earth is not only himself from the earth, his teaching also is from the earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What He has seen and heard, to that He bears witness; but His testimony no one receives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Any man who has received His testimony has solemnly declared that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For He whom God has sent speaks God's words; for God does not give the Spirit with limitations.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything to His hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who believes in the Son has the Life of the Ages; he who disobeys the Son will not enter into Life, but God's anger remains upon him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
