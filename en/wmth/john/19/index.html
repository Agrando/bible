And Pilate said to them, »See, there is the man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As soon then as the High Priests and the officers saw Him, they shouted »To the cross! To the cross!« »Take him yourselves and crucify him,« said Pilate; »for I, at any rate, find no crime in him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»We,« replied the Jews, »have a Law, and in accordance with that Law he ought to die, for having claimed to be the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>More alarmed than ever, Pilate no sooner heard these words than he re-entered the Praetorium and began to question Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»What is your origin?« he asked. But Jesus gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»Do you refuse to speak even to me?« asked Pilate; »do you not know that I have it in my power either to release you or to crucify you?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»You would have had no power whatever over me,« replied Jesus, »had it not been granted you from above. On that account he who has delivered me up to you is more guilty than you are.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Upon receiving this answer, Pilate was for releasing Him. But the Jews kept shouting, »If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar's. Every one who sets himself up as king declares himself a rebel against Caesar.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On hearing this, Pilate brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judge's seat in a place called the Pavement–or in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about six o'clock in the morning. Then he said to the Jews, »There is your king!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This caused a storm of outcries, »Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!«»Am I to crucify your king?« Pilate asked. »We have no king, except Caesar,« answered the High Priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Pilate gave Him up to them to be crucified. Accordingly they took Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and He went out carrying His own cross, to the place called Skull-place –or, in Hebrew, Golgotha–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>where they nailed Him to a cross, and two others at the same time, one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate wrote a notice and had it fastened to the top of the cross. It ran thus: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of the Jews read this notice, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was in three languages–Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This led the Jewish High Priests to remonstrate with Pilate. »You should not write `The King of the Jews,'« they said, »but that he claimed to be King of the Jews.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»What I have written I have written,« was Pilate's answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the soldiers, as soon as they had crucified Jesus, took His garments, including His tunic, and divided them into four parts–one part for each soldier. The tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they said to one another, »Do not let us tear it. Let us draw lots for it.« This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, »They shared my garments among them, and drew lots for my clothing.« That was just what the soldiers did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now standing close to the cross of Jesus were His mother and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So Jesus, seeing His mother, and seeing the disciple whom He loved standing near, said to His mother, »Behold, your son!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then He said to the disciple, »Behold, your mother!« And from that time the disciple received her into his own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After this, Jesus, knowing that everything was now brought to an end, said–that the Scripture might be fulfilled, »I am thirsty.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There was a jar of wine standing there. With this wine they filled a sponge, put it on the end of a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As soon as Jesus had taken the wine, He said, »It is finished.« And then, bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Meanwhile the Jews, because it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, and in order that the bodies might not remain on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was one of special solemnity), requested Pilate to have the legs of the dying men broken, and the bodies removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and also of the other who had been crucified with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they came to Jesus Himself: but when they saw that He was already dead, they refrained from breaking His legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>One of the soldiers, however, made a thrust at His side with a lance, and immediately blood and water flowed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This statement is the testimony of an eye-witness, and it is true. He knows that he is telling the truth–in order that you also may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For all this took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled which declares, »Not one of His bones shall be broken.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another Scripture says, »They shall look on Him whom they have pierced.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but for fear of the Jews a secret disciple, asked Pilate's permission to carry away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and removed the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nicodemus too –he who at first had visited Jesus by night– came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, in weight about seventy or eighty pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Taking down the body they wrapped it in linen cloths along with the spices, in accordance with the Jewish mode of preparing for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There was a garden at the place where Jesus had been crucified, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation for the Jewish Passover, and the tomb was close at hand, they put Jesus there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
