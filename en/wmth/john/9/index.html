Night is coming on, when no one can work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>After thus speaking, He spat on the ground, and then, kneading the dust and spittle into clay, He smeared the clay over the man's eyes and said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>»Go and wash in the pool of Siloam« –the name means `Sent.' So he went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>His neighbours, therefore, and the other people to whom he had been a familiar object because he was a beggar, began asking, »Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Yes it is,« replied some of them. »No it is not,« said others, »but he is like him.« His own statement was, »I am the man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»How then were your eyes opened?« they asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»He whose name is Jesus,« he answered, »made clay and smeared my eyes with it, and then told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and obtained sight.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»Where is he?« they inquired, but the man did not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought him to the Pharisees–the man who had been blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened the man's eyes was the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the Pharisees renewed their questioning as to how he had obtained his sight. »He put clay on my eyes,« he replied, »and I washed, and now I can see.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This led some of the Pharisees to say, »That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.«»How is it possible for a bad man to do such miracles?« argued others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there was a division among them. So again they asked the once blind man, »What is your account of him? –for he opened your eyes.«»He is a Prophet,« he replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews, however, did not believe the statement concerning him –that he had been blind and had obtained his sight– until they called his parents and asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it then that he can now see?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»We know,« replied the parents, »that this is our son and that he was born blind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but how it is that he can now see or who has opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him himself; he is of full age; he himself will give his own account of it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Such was their answer, because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already settled among themselves that if any one should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be excluded from the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That was why his parents said, »He is of full age: ask him himself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>A second time therefore they called the man who had been blind, and said, »Give God the praise: we know that that man is a sinner.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know,« he replied; »one thing I know–that I was once blind and that now I can see.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»What did he do to you?« they asked; »how did he open your eyes?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»I have told you already,« he replied, »and you did not listen to me. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also mean to be disciples of his?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they railed at him, and said, »You are that man's disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this fellow we do not know where he comes from.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Why, this is marvellous!« the man replied; »you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has opened my eyes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God does not listen to bad people, but that if any one is a God-fearing man and obeys Him, to him He listens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>From the beginning of the world such a thing was never heard of as that any one should open the eyes of a man blind from his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Had that man not come from God, he could have done nothing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»You,« they replied, »were wholly begotten and born in sin, and do you teach us?« And they put him out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had done this. So having found him, He asked him, »Do you believe in the Son of God?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Who is He, Sir?« replied the man. »Tell me, so that I may believe in Him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»You have seen Him,« said Jesus; »and not only so: He is now speaking to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»I believe, Sir,« he said. And he threw himself at His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»I came into this world,« said Jesus, »to judge men, that those who do not see may see, and that those who do see may become blind.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>These words were heard by those of the Pharisees who were present, and they asked Him, »Are we also blind?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»If you were blind,« answered Jesus, »you would have no sin; but as a matter of fact you boast that you see. So your sin remains!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
