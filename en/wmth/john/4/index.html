It was about six o'clock in the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Presently there came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus asked her to give Him some water;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for His disciples were gone to the town to buy provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»How is it,« replied the woman, »that a Jew like you asks me, who am a woman and a Samaritan, for water?« (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»If you had known God's free gift,« replied Jesus, »and who it is that said to you, `Give me some water,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»Sir,« she said, »you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; so where can you get the living water from?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are you greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank from it, as did also his sons and his cattle?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Every one,« replied Jesus, »who drinks any of this water will be thirsty again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but whoever drinks any of the water that I shall give him will never, never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become a fountain within him of water springing up for the Life of the Ages.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»Sir,« said the woman, »give me that water, that I may never be thirsty, nor continually come all the way here to draw from the well.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»Go and call your husband,« said Jesus; »and come back.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»I have no husband,« she replied. »You rightly say that you have no husband,« said Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»for you have had five husbands, and the man you have at present is not your husband. You have spoken the truth in saying that.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»Sir,« replied the woman, »I see that you are a Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Believe me,« said Jesus, »the time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You worship One of whom you know nothing. We worship One whom we know; for salvation comes from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But a time is coming –nay, has already come– when the true worshippers will worship the Father with true spiritual worship; for indeed the Father desires such worshippers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must bring Him true spiritual worship.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I know,« replied the woman, »that Messiah is coming–`the Christ,' as He is called. When He has come, He will tell us everything.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I am He,« said Jesus– »I who am now talking to you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Just then His disciples came, and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. Yet not one of them asked Him, »What is your wish?« or »Why are you talking with her?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman however, leaving her pitcher, went away to the town, and called the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>»Come,« she said, »and see a man who has told me everything I have ever done. Can this be the Christ, do you think?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They left the town and set out to go to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Meanwhile the disciples were urging Jesus. »Rabbi,« they said, »eat something.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»I have food to eat,« He replied, »of which you do not know.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So the disciples began questioning one another. »Can it be,« they said, »that some one has brought Him something to eat?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»My food,« said Jesus, »is to be obedient to Him who sent me, and fully to accomplish His work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say, `It wants four months yet to the harvest'? But look round, I tell you, and observe these plains– they are already ripe for the sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The reaper gets pay and gathers in a crop in preparation for the Life of the Ages, that so the sower and the reapers may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For it is in this that you see the real meaning of the saying, `The sower is one person, and the reaper is another.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap a harvest which is not the result of your own labours. Others have laboured, and you are getting benefit from their labours.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Of the Samaritan population of that town a good many believed in Him because of the woman's statement when she declared, »He has told me all that I have ever done.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When however the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him on all sides to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then a far larger number of people believed because of His own words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they said to the woman, »We no longer believe in Him simply because of your statements; for we have now heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After the two days He departed, and went into Galilee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>though Jesus Himself declared that a Prophet has no honour in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When however He reached Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed Him eagerly, having been eye-witnesses of all that He had done in Jerusalem at the Festival; for they also had been to the Festival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So He came once more to Cana in Galilee, where He had made the water into wine. Now there was a certain officer of the King's court whose son was ill at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Having heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, he came to Him and begged Him to go down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»Unless you and others see miracles and marvels,« said Jesus, »nothing will induce you to believe.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»Sir,« pleaded the officer, »come down before my child dies.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»You may return home,« replied Jesus; »your son has recovered.« He believed the words of Jesus, and started back home;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and he was already on his way down when his servants met him and told him that his son was alive and well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>So he inquired of them at what hour he had shown improvement. »Yesterday, about seven o'clock,« they replied, »the fever left him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then the father recollected that that was the time at which Jesus had said to him, »Your son has recovered,« and he and his whole household became believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This is the second miracle that Jesus performed, after coming from Judaea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
