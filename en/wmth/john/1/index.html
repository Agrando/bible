He was full of grace and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>John gave testimony concerning Him and cried aloud, saying, »This is He of whom I said, `He who is coming after me has been put before me,' for He was before me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For He it is from whose fulness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No human eye has ever seen God: the only Son, who is in the Father's bosom–He has made Him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This also is John's testimony, when the Jews sent to him a deputation of Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He avowed–he did not conceal the truth, but avowed, »I am not the Christ.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»What then?« they inquired; »are you Elijah?«»I am not,« he said. »Are you the Prophet?«»No,« he answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they pressed the question. »Who are you?« they said– »that we may take an answer to those who sent us. What account do you give of yourself?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»I am the voice, he replied, of one crying aloud, `Make straight the Lord's way in the Desert,' fulfilling the words of the Prophet Isaiah.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They were Pharisees who had been sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Again they questioned him. »Why then do you baptize,« they said, »if you are neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»I baptize in water only,« John answered, »but in your midst stands One whom you do not know–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who is to come after me, and whose sandal-strap I am not worthy to unfasten.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This conversation took place at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him and exclaimed, »Look, that is the Lamb of God who is to take away the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is He about whom I said, `After me is to come One who has been put before me, because He was before me.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I did not yet know Him; but that He may be openly shown to Israel is the reason why I have come baptizing in water.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>John also gave testimony by stating: »I have seen the Spirit coming down like a dove out of Heaven; and it remained upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I did not yet know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, »`The One on whom you see the Spirit coming down, and remaining, He it is who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»This I have seen, and I have become a witness that He is the Son of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>when he saw Jesus passing by, and said, »Look! that is the Lamb of God!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The two disciples heard his exclamation, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus turned round, and seeing them following He asked them, »What is your wish?« »Rabbi,« they replied- `Rabbi' means `Teacher' »where are you staying?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>»Come and you shall see,« He said. So they went and saw where He was staying, and they remained and spent that day with Him. It was then about ten o'clock in the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John's exclamation and followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, »We have found the Messiah!« –that is to say, the Anointed One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, »You are Simon, son of John: you shall be called Cephas« –that is to say, Peter (or `Rock').</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The next day, having decided to leave Bethany and go into Galilee, Jesus found Philip, and invited him to follow Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>(Now Philip came from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, »We have found him about whom Moses in the Law wrote, as well as the Prophets–Jesus, the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Can anything good come out of Nazareth?« replied Nathanael. »Come and see,« said Philip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, and said of him, »Look! here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceitfulness!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»How do you know me?« Nathanael asked. »Before Philip called you,« said Jesus, »when you were under the fig-tree I saw you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»Rabbi,« cried Nathanael, »you are the Son of God, you are Israel's King!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»Because I said to you, `I saw you under the fig-tree,'« replied Jesus, »do you believe? You shall see greater things than that.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»I tell you all in most solemn truth,« He added, »that you shall see Heaven opened wide, and God's angels going up, and coming down to the Son of Man.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
