Trust in God: trust in me also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In my Father's house there are many resting-places. Were it otherwise, I would have told you; for I am going to make ready a place for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if I go and make ready a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me, that where I am you also may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And where I am going, you all know the way.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Master,« said Thomas, »we do not know where you are going. In what sense do we know the way?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>»I am the Way,« replied Jesus, »and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you –all of you– knew me, you would fully know my Father also. From this time forward you know Him and have seen Him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Master,« said Philip, »cause us to see the Father: that is all we need.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Have I been so long among you,« Jesus answered, »and yet you, Philip, do not know me? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you ask me, `Cause us to see the Father'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do you not believe that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me? The things that I tell you all I do not speak on my own authority: but the Father dwelling within me carries on His own work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe me, all of you, that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me; or at any rate, believe me because of what I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In most solemn truth I tell you that he who trusts in me–the things which I do he shall do also; and greater things than these he shall do, because I am going to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whatever any of you ask in my name, I will do, in order that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you make any request of me in my name, I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»If you love me, you will obey my commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate to be for ever with you–the Spirit of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That Spirit the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him. You know Him, because He remains by your side and is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you bereaved: I am coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me: because I live, you also shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At that time you will know that I am in my Father, and that you are in me, and that I am in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who has my commandments and obeys them–he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will clearly reveal myself to him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas (not the Iscariot) asked, »Master, how is it that you will reveal yourself clearly to us and not to the world?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»If any one loves me,« replied Jesus, »he will obey my teaching; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who has no love for me does not obey my teaching; and yet the teaching to which you are listening is not mine, but is the teaching of the Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»All this I have spoken to you while still with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send at my request, will teach you everything, and will bring to your memories all that I have said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave with you: my own peace I give to you. It is not as the world gives its greetings that I give you peace. Let not your hearts be troubled or dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»You heard me say to you, `I am going away, and yet I am coming to you.' If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater than I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I have now told you before it comes to pass, that when it has come to pass you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In future I shall not talk much with you, for the Prince of this world is coming. And yet in me he has nothing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but it is in order that the world may know that I love the Father, and that it is in obedience to the command which the Father gave me that I thus act. Rise, let us be going.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
