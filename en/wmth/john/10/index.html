If any one enters by me, he will find safety, and will go in and out and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy: I have come that they may have Life, and may have it in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»I am the Good Shepherd. A good shepherd lays down his very life for the sheep.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The hired servant –one who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep– no sooner sees the wolf coming than he leaves the sheep and runs away; and the wolf worries and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he is only a hired servant and cares nothing for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»I am the Good Shepherd. And I know my sheep and my sheep know me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I am laying down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I have also other sheep–which do not belong to this fold. Those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice; and they shall become one flock under one Shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this reason my Father loves me, because I am laying down my life in order to receive it back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one is taking it away from me, but I myself am laying it down. I am authorized to lay it down, and I am authorized to receive it back again. This is the command I received from my Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again there arose a division among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them said, »He is possessed by a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to him?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others argued, »That is not the language of a demoniac: and can a demon open blind men's eyes?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Dedication Festival came on in Jerusalem. It was winter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon's Portico,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when the Jews gathered round Him and kept asking Him, »How long do you mean to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so plainly.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»I have told you,« answered Jesus, »and you do not believe. The deeds that I do in my Father's name–they give testimony about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I give them the Life of the Ages, and they shall never, never perish, nor shall any one wrest them from my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>What my Father has given me is more precious than all besides; and no one is able to wrest anything from my Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Again the Jews brought stones with which to stone Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus remonstrated with them. »Many good deeds,« He said, »have I shown you as coming from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»For no good deed,« the Jews replied, »are we going to stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to be God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Does it not stand written in your Law,« replied Jesus, »`I said, you are gods'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If those to whom God's word was addressed are called gods (and the Scripture cannot be annulled),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>how is it that you say to one whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, `You are blaspheming,' because I said, `I am God's Son'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If the deeds I do are not my Father's deeds, do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if they are, then even if you do not believe me, at least believe the deeds, that you may know and see clearly that the Father is in me, and that I am in the Father.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>This made them once more try to arrest Him, but He withdrew out of their power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then He went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John had been baptizing at first; and there He stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Large numbers of people also came to Him. Their report was, »John did not work any miracle, but all that John said about this Teacher was true.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many became believers in Him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
