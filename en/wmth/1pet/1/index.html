May more and more grace and peace be granted to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who in His great mercy has begotten us anew to an ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>to an inheritance imperishable, undefiled and unfading, which has been reserved in Heaven for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>whom God in His power is guarding through faith for a salvation that even now stands ready for unveiling at the End of the Age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Rejoice triumphantly in the prospect of this, even if now, for a short time, you are compelled to sorrow amid various trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The sorrow comes in order that the testing of your faith –being more precious than that of gold, which perishes and yet is proved by fire– may be found to result in praise and glory and honour at the re-appearing of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Him you love, though your eyes have never looked on Him. In Him, though at present you cannot see Him, you nevertheless trust, and triumph with a joy which is unspeakable and is crowned with glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>while you are securing as the outcome of your faith the salvation of your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There were Prophets who earnestly inquired about that salvation, and closely searched into it–even those who spoke beforehand of the grace which was to come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were eager to know the time which the Spirit of Christ within them kept indicating, or the characteristics of that time, when they solemnly made known beforehand the sufferings that were to come upon Christ and the glories which would follow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To them it was revealed that they were serving not themselves but you, when they foretold the very things which have now been openly declared to you by those who, having been taught by the Holy Spirit which had been sent from Heaven, brought you the Good News. Angels long to stoop and look into these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore gird up your minds and fix your hopes calmly and unfalteringly upon the boon that is soon to be yours, at the re-appearing of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, since you delight in obedience, do not shape your lives by the cravings which used to dominate you in the time of your ignorance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but –in imitation of the holy One who has called you– you also must be holy in all your habits of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because it stands written, »You are to be holy, because I am holy.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if you address as your Father Him who judges impartially in accordance with each man's actions, then spend in fear the time of your stay here on earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>knowing, as you do, that it was not with a ransom of perishable wealth, such as silver or gold, that you were set free from your frivolous habits of life which had been handed down to you from your forefathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with the precious blood of Christ–as of an unblemished and spotless lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He was pre-destined indeed to this work, even before the creation of the world, but has been plainly manifested in these last days for the sake of you who, through Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>are faithful to God, who raised Him from among the dead and gave Him glory, so that your faith and hope are resting upon God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now that, through your obedience to the truth, you have purified your souls for cherishing sincere brotherly love, you must love another heartily and fervently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For you have been begotten again by God's ever-living and enduring word from a germ not of perishable, but of imperishable life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»All mankind resemble the herbage, and all their beauty is like its flowers. The herbage dries up, and its flowers drop off;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the word of the Lord remains for ever.« And that means the Message which has been proclaimed among you in the Good News.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
