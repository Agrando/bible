Once you had not found mercy, but now you have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Dear friends, I entreat you as pilgrims and foreigners not to indulge the cravings of your lower natures: for all such cravings wage war upon the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Live honourable lives among the Gentiles, in order that, although they now speak against you as evil-doers, they may yet witness your good conduct, and may glorify God on the day of reward and retribution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Submit, for the Lord's sake, to every authority set up by man, whether it be to the Emperor as supreme ruler,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to provincial Governors as sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers and the encouragement of those who do what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For it is God's will that by doing what is right you should thus silence the ignorant talk of foolish persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be free men, and yet do not make your freedom an excuse for base conduct, but be God's bondservants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Honour every one. Love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the Emperor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Household servants, be submissive to your masters, and show them the utmost respect–not only if they are kind and thoughtful, but also if they are unreasonable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is an acceptable thing with God, if, from a sense of duty to Him, a man patiently submits to wrong, when treated unjustly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If you do wrong and receive a blow for it, what credit is there in your bearing it patiently? But if when you do right and suffer for it you bear it patiently, this is an acceptable thing with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it is to this you were called; because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you an example so that you should follow in His steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He never sinned, and no deceitful language was ever heard from His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When He was reviled, He did not answer with reviling; when He suffered He uttered no threats, but left His wrongs in the hands of the righteous Judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The burden of our sins He Himself carried in His own body to the Cross and bore it there, so that we, having died so far as our sins are concerned, may live righteous lives. By His wounds yours have been healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were straying like lost sheep, but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Protector of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
