Exercise the oversight not reluctantly but eagerly, in accordance with the will of God; not for base gain but with cheerful minds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>not lording it over your Churches but proving yourselves patterns for the flock to imitate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And then, when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the never-withering wreath of glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the same way you younger men must submit to your elders; and all of you must gird yourselves with humility towards one another, for God sets Himself against the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Humble yourselves therefore beneath the mighty hand of God, so that at the right time He may set you on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Throw the whole of your anxiety upon Him, because He Himself cares for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Curb every passion, and be on the alert. Your great accuser, the Devil, is going about like a roaring lion to see whom he can devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Withstand him, firm in your faith; knowing that your brethren in other parts of the world are passing through just the same experiences.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And God, the giver of all grace, who has called you to share His eternal glory, through Christ, after you have suffered for a short time, will Himself make you perfect, firm, and strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To Him be all power unto the Ages of the Ages! Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I send this short letter by Silas, our faithful brother –for such I regard him– in order to encourage you, and to bear witness that what I have told you is the true grace of God.
