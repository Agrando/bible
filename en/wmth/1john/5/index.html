And it is the Spirit who gives testimony– because the Spirit is the Truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three that give testimony– the Spirit, the water, and the blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and there is complete agreement between these three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we accept the testimony of men, God's testimony is greater: for God's testimony consists of the things which He has testified about His Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in his own heart: he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, in that he has refused to accept the testimony which God has given about His Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And that testimony is to the effect that God has given us the Life of the Ages, and that this Life is in His Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who has the Son has the Life: he who has not the Son of God has not the Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write all this to you in order that you who believe in the Son of God may know for certain that you already have the Life of the Ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have an assured confidence that whenever we ask anything in accordance with His will, He listens to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And since we know that He listens to us, then whatever we ask, we know that we have the things which we have asked from Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any one sees a brother man committing a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask and God shall give him life–for those who do not sin unto death. There is such a thing as sin unto death; for that I do not bid him make request.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Any kind of wrongdoing is sin; but there is sin which is not unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that no one who is a child of God lives in sin, but He who is God's Child keeps him, and the Evil one cannot touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the Evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we know the true One, and are in union with the true One–that is, we are in union with His Son Jesus Christ.
