For this reason the world does not recognize us– because it has not known Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Dear friends, we are now God's children, but what we are to be in the future has not yet been fully revealed. We know that if Christ reappears we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And every man who has this hope fixed on Him, purifies himself so as to be as pure as He is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Every one who is guilty of sin is also guilty of violating Law; for sin is the violation of Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No one who continues in union with Him lives in sin: no one who lives in sin has seen Him or knows Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Dear children, let no one lead you astray. The man who acts righteously is righteous, just as He is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who is habitually guilty of sin is a child of the Devil, because the Devil has been a sinner from the very beginning. The Son of God appeared for the purpose of undoing the work of the Devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>No one who is a child of God is habitually guilty of sin. A God-given germ of life remains in him, and he cannot habitually sin–because he is a child of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By this we can distinguish God's children and the Devil's children: no one who fails to act righteously is a child of God, nor he who does not love his brother man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the Message you have heard from the beginning–that we are to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We are not to resemble Cain, who was a child of the Evil one and killed his own brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own actions were wicked and his brother's actions righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As for us, we know that we have already passed out of death into Life–because we love our brother men. He who is destitute of love continues dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Every one who hates his brother man is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has the Life of the Ages continuing in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>We know what love is–through Christ's having laid down His life on our behalf; and in the same way we ought to lay down our lives for our brother men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if any one has this world's wealth and sees that his brother man is in need, and yet hardens his heart against him–how can such a one continue to love God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Dear children, let us not love in words only nor with the lips, but in deed and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And in this way we shall come to know that we are loyal to the truth, and shall satisfy our consciences in His presence</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>in whatever matters our hearts condemn us–because God is greater than our hearts and knows everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have perfect confidence towards God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and whatever we ask for we obtain from Him, because we obey His commands and do the things which are pleasing in His sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is His command–that we are to believe in His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as He has commanded us to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The man who obeys His commands continues in union with God, and God continues in union with him; and through His Spirit whom He has given us we can know that He continues in union with us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
