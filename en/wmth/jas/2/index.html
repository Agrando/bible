Has not God chosen those whom the world regards as poor to be rich in faith and heirs of the Kingdom which He has promised to those that love Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you have put dishonour upon the poor man. Yet is it not the rich who grind you down? Are not they the very people who drag you into the Law courts? –</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the very people who speak evil of the noble Name by which you are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If, however, you are keeping the Law as supreme, in obedience to the Commandment which says »You are to love your fellow man just as you love yourself,« you are acting rightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you are making distinctions between one man and another, you are guilty of sin, and are convicted by the Law as offenders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>A man who has kept the Law as a whole, but has failed to keep some one command, has become guilty of violating all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He who said, »Do not commit adultery,« also said, »Do not commit murder,« and if you are a murderer, although not an adulterer, you have become an offender against the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Speak and act as those should who are expecting to be judged by the Law of freedom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he who shows no mercy will have judgement given against him without mercy; but mercy triumphs over judgement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What good is it, my brethren, if a man professes to have faith, and yet his actions do not correspond? Can such faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Suppose a Christian brother or sister is poorly clad or lacks daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you says to them, »I wish you well; keep yourselves warm and well fed,« and yet you do not give them what they need; what is the use of that?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So also faith, if it is unaccompanied by obedience, has no life in it–so long as it stands alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Nay, some one will say, »You have faith, I have actions: prove to me your faith apart from corresponding actions and I will prove mine to you by my actions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that God is one, and you are quite right: evil spirits also believe this, and shudder.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, idle boaster, are you willing to be taught how it is that faith apart from obedience is worthless? Take the case of Abraham our forefather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was it, or was it not, because of his actions that he was declared to be righteous as the result of his having offered up his son Isaac upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You notice that his faith was co-operating with his actions, and that by his actions his faith was perfected;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, »And Abraham believed God, and his faith was placed to his credit as righteousness,« and he received the name of `God's friend.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You all see that it is because of actions that a man is pronounced righteous, and not simply because of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way also was not the notorious sinner Rahab declared to be righteous because of her actions when she welcomed the spies and hurriedly helped them to escape another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For just as a human body without a spirit is lifeless, so also faith is lifeless if it is unaccompanied by obedience.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
