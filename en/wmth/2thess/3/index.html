There was no disorder in our lives among you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>nor did we eat any one's bread without paying for it, but we laboured and toiled, working hard night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This was not because we had not a claim upon you, but it arose from a desire to set you an example–for you to imitate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For even when we were with you, we laid down this rule for you:»If a man does not choose to work, neither shall he eat.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For we hear that there are some of you who live disorderly lives and are mere idle busybodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To persons of that sort our injunction –and our command by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ– is that they are to work quietly and eat their own honestly-earned bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you, brethren, must not grow weary in the path of duty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if any one refuses to obey these our written instructions, mark that man and hold no communication with him–so that he may be made to feel ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And yet do not regard him as an enemy, but caution him as a brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every sense. The Lord be with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I Paul add the greeting with my own hand, which is the credential in every letter of mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This is my handwriting.
