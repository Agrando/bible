for we are, as it were, parts of one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If angry, beware of sinning. Let not your irritation last until the sun goes down;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and do not leave room for the Devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He who has been a thief must steal no more, but, instead of that, should work with his own hands in honest industry, so that he may have something of which he can give the needy a share.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let no unwholesome words ever pass your lips, but let all your words be good for benefiting others according to the need of the moment, so that they may be a means of blessing to the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And beware of grieving the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you have been sealed in preparation for the day of Redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let all bitterness and all passionate feeling, all anger and loud insulting language, be unknown among you–and also every kind of malice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>On the contrary learn to be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ has also forgiven you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
