Now, as Christians, you are Light itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Live and act as sons of Light –for the effect of the Light is seen in every kind of goodness, uprightness and truth–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and learn in your own experiences what is fully pleasing to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Have nothing to do with the barren unprofitable deeds of darkness, but, instead of that, set your faces against them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the things which are done by these people in secret it is disgraceful even to speak of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But everything can be tested by the light and thus be shown in its true colors; for whatever shines of itself is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this reason it is said, »Rise, sleeper; rise from among the dead, and Christ will shed light upon you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore be very careful how you live and act. Let it not be as unwise men, but as wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Buy up your opportunities, for these are evil times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On this account do not prove yourselves wanting in sense, but try to understand what the Lord's will is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not over-indulge in wine –a thing in which excess is so easy–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but drink deeply of God's Spirit. Speak to one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and offer praise in your hearts to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Always and for everything let your thanks to God the Father be presented in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Married women, submit to your own husbands as if to the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>because a husband is the Head of his wife as Christ also is the Head of the Church, being indeed the Saviour of this His Body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And just as the Church submits to Christ, so also married women should be entirely submissive to their husbands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Married men, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself up to death for her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in order to make her holy, cleansing her with the baptismal water by the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that He might present the Church to Himself a glorious bride, without spot or wrinkle or any other defect, but to be holy and unblemished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So too married men ought to love their wives as much as they love themselves. He who loves his wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For never yet has a man hated his own body. On the contrary he feeds and cherishes it, just as Christ feeds and cherishes the Church;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because we are, as it were, parts of His Body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»For this reason a man is to leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife, and the two shall be as one.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That is a great truth hitherto kept secret: I mean the truth concerning Christ and the Church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Yet I insist that among you also, each man is to love his own wife as much as he loves himself, and let a married woman see to it that she treats her husband with respect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
