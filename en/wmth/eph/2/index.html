It is God's gift, and is not on the ground of merit–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>so that it may be impossible for any one to boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For we are God's own handiwork, created in Christ Jesus for good works which He has pre-destined us to practise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, do not forget that formerly you were Gentiles as to your bodily condition. You were called the Uncircumcision by those who style themselves the Circumcised–their circumcision being one which the knife has effected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At that time you were living apart from Christ, estranged from the Commonwealth of Israel, with no share by birth in the Covenants which are based on the Promises, and you had no hope and no God, in all the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But now in Christ Jesus you who once were so far away have been brought near through the death of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For He is our peace–He who has made Jews and Gentiles one, and in His own human nature has broken down the hostile dividing wall,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>by setting aside the Law with its commandments, expressed, as they were, in definite decrees. His design was to unite the two sections of humanity in Himself so as to form one new man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>thus effecting peace, and to reconcile Jews and Gentiles in one body to God, by means of His cross–slaying by it their mutual enmity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So He came and proclaimed good news of peace to you who were so far away, and peace to those who were near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because it is through Him that Jews and Gentiles alike have access through one Spirit to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You are therefore no longer mere foreigners or persons excluded from civil rights. On the contrary you share citizenship with God's people and are members of His family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You are a building which has been reared on the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, the cornerstone being Christ Jesus Himself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>in union with whom the whole fabric, fitted and closely joined together, is growing so as to form a holy sanctuary in the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>in whom you also are being built up together to become a fixed abode for God through the Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
