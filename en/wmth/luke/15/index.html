But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and pitied him, and ran and threw his arms round his neck and kissed him tenderly.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»`Father,' cried the son, `I have sinned against Heaven and before you: no longer do I deserve to be called a son of yours.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»But the father said to his servants,« `Fetch a good coat quickly –the best one– and put it on him; and bring a ring for his finger and shoes for his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Fetch the fat calf and kill it, and let us feast and enjoy ourselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for my son here was dead and has come to life again: he was lost and has been found.' »And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Now his elder son was out on the farm; and when he returned and came near home, he heard music and dancing.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he called one of the lads to him and asked what all this meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»`Your brother has come,' he replied; `and your father has had the fat calf killed, because he has got him home safe and sound.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Then he was angry and would not go in.
