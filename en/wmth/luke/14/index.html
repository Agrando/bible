This will be doing you honour in the presence of all the other guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For whoever uplifts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be uplifted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Also to His host, who had invited Him, He said, »When you give a breakfast or a dinner, do not invite your friends or brothers or relatives or rich neighbours, lest perhaps they should invite you in return and a requital be made you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when you entertain, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and you will be blessed, because they have no means of requiting you, but there will be requital for you at the Resurrection of the righteous.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>After listening to this teaching, one of His fellow guests said to Him, »Blessed is he who shall feast in God's Kingdom.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»A man once gave a great dinner,« replied Jesus, »to which he invited a large number of guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At dinner-time he sent his servant to announce to those who had been invited, »`Come, for things are now ready.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»But they all without exception began to excuse themselves. The first told him,« `I have purchased a piece of land, and must of necessity go and look at it. Pray hold me excused.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»A second pleaded,« `I have bought five yoke of oxen, and am on my way to try them. Pray hold me excused.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»Another said,« `I am just married. It is impossible for me to come.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»So the servant came and brought these answers to his master, and they stirred his anger.« `Go out quickly,' he said, `into the streets of the city–the wide ones and the narrow. You will see poor men, and crippled, blind, lame: fetch them all in here.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>»Soon the servant reported the result, saying,« `Sir, what you ordered is done, and there is room still.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»`Go out,' replied the master, `to the high roads and hedge-rows, and compel the people to come in, so that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell you that not one of those who were invited shall taste my dinner.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>On His journey vast crowds attended Him, towards whom He turned and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»If any one is coming to me who does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes and his own life also, he cannot be a disciple of mine.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No one who does not carry his own cross and come after me can be a disciple of mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not sit down first and calculate the cost, asking if he has the means to finish it?« –</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>lest perhaps, when he has laid the foundation and is unable to finish, all who see it shall begin to jeer at him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, `This man began to build, but could not finish.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Or what king, marching to encounter another king in war, does not first sit down and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand men to meet the one who is advancing against him with twenty thousand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If not, while the other is still a long way off, he sends messengers and sues for peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Just as no one of you who does not detach himself from all that belongs to him can be a disciple of mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Salt is good: but if even the salt has become tasteless, what will you use to season it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Neither for land nor dunghill is it of any use; they throw it away. Listen, every one who has ears to listen with!«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
