And who is it that gave you this authority?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>»I also will put a question to you,« He said;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>»was John's baptism of Heavenly or of human origin?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they debated the matter with one another. »If we say `Heavenly,'« they argued, »he will say, `Why did you not believe him?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if we say, `human,' the people will all stone us; for they are thoroughly convinced that John was a Prophet.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they answered that they did not know the origin of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»Nor will I tell you,« said Jesus, »by what authority I do these things.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then He proceeded to speak a parable to the people. »There was a man,« He said, »who planted a vineyard, let it out to vine-dressers, and went abroad for a considerable time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>At vintage-time he sent a servant to the vine-dressers, for them to give him a share of the crop; but the vine-dressers beat him cruelly and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he sent a second servant; and him too they beat and ill treated and sent away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then again he sent a third; and this one also they wounded and drove away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the owner of the vineyard said, »`What am I to do? I will send my son–my dearly-loved son: they will probably respect him.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»But when the vine-dressers saw him, they discussed the matter with one another, and said,« `This is the heir: let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>»So they turned him out of the vineyard and murdered him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and put these vine-dressers to death, and give the vineyard to others.« »God forbid!« exclaimed the hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He looked at them and said, »What then does that mean which is written, »`The Stone which the builders rejected has been made the cornerstone'?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one who falls on that stone will be severely hurt, but on whomsoever it falls, he will be utterly crushed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>At this the Scribes and the High Priests wanted to lay hands on Him, then and there; only they were afraid of the people. For they saw that in this parable He had referred to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So, after impatiently watching their opportunity, they sent spies who were to act the part of good and honest men, that they might fasten on some expression of His, so as to hand Him over to the ruling power and the Governor's authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they put a question to Him. »Rabbi,« they said, »we know that you say and teach what is right and that you make no distinctions between one man and another, but teach God's way truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it allowable to pay a tax to Caesar, or not?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But He saw through their knavery and replied,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Show me a shilling; whose likeness and inscription does it bear?« »Caesar's,« they said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Pay therefore,« He replied, »what is Caesar's to Caesar–and what is God's to God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There was nothing here that they could lay hold of before the people, and marvelling at His answer they said no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Next some of the Sadducees came forward (who deny that there is a Resurrection), and they asked Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Rabbi, Moses made it a law for us that if a man's brother should die, leaving a wife but no children, the man shall marry the widow and raise up a family for his brother.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there were seven brothers. The first of them took a wife and died childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The second and the third also took her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and all seven, having done the same, left no children when they died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Finally the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The woman, then –at the Resurrection– whose wife shall she be? for they all seven married her.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»The men of this age,« replied Jesus, »marry, and the women are given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But as for those who shall have been deemed worthy to find a place in that other age and in the Resurrection from among the dead, the men do not marry and the women are not given in marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For indeed they cannot die again; they are like angels, and are sons of God through being sons of the Resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But that the dead rise to life even Moses clearly implies in the passage about the Bush, where he calls the Lord `The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He is not a God of dead, but of living men, for to Him are all living.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then some of the Scribes replied, »Rabbi, you have spoken well.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>From that time, however, no one ventured to challenge Him with a single question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But He asked them, »How is it they say that the Christ is a son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Why, David himself says in the Book of Psalms, »`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Until I have made thy foes a footstool under they feet.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>»David himself therefore calls Him Lord, and how can He be his son?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then, in the hearing of all the people, He said to the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Beware of the Scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and love to be bowed to in places of public resort and to occupy the best seats in the synagogues or at a dinner party;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who swallow up the property of widows and mask their wickedness by making long prayers. They will be punished far more severely than others.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
