You knew me to be a severe man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow:«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>why then did you not put my money into a bank, that when I came I might have received it back with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»And he said to those who stood by,« `Take the pound from him and give it to him who has the ten pounds.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(They said to him, »`Sir, he already has ten pounds.')</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»`I tell you that to every one who has anything, more shall be given; and from him who has not anything, even what he has shall be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But as for those enemies of mine who were unwilling that I should become their king, bring them here, and cut them to pieces in my presence.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After thus speaking, He journeyed onward, proceeding up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he was come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount called the Oliveyard, He sent two of the disciples on in front,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying to them, »Go into the village facing you. On entering it you will find an ass's foal tied up which no one has ever yet ridden: untie it, and bring it here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if any one asks you, `Why are you untying the colt?' simply say, `The Master needs it.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So those who were sent went and found things as He had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while they were untying the colt the owners called out, »Why are you untying the colt?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and they replied, »The Master needs it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they brought it to Jesus, and after throwing their outer garments on the colt they placed Jesus on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So He rode on, while they carpeted the road with their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when He was now getting near Jerusalem, and descending the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began in their joy to praise God in loud voices for all the mighty deeds they had witnessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Blessed is the King,« they cried, »who comes in the name of the Lord: in Heaven peace, and glory in the highest realms.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thereupon some of the Pharisees in the crowd appealed to Him, saying, »Rabbi, reprove your disciples.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>»I tell you,« He replied, »that if they became silent, the very stones would cry out.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When He came into full view of the city, He wept aloud over it, and exclaimed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»O that at this time thou hadst known –yes even thou– what makes peace possible! But now it is hid from thine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the time is coming upon thee when thy foes will throw up around thee earthworks and a wall, investing thee and hemming thee in on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they will dash thee to the ground and thy children within thee, and will not leave one stone upon another within thee; because thou hast not recognized the time of thy visitation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then Jesus entered the Temple and proceeded to drive out the dealers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»It is written,« He said, »`And My house shall be the House of Prayer,' but you have made it a robbers' cave.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And day after day He taught in the Temple, while the High Priests and the Scribes were devising some means of destroying Him, as were also the leading men of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But they could not find any way of doing it, for the people all hung upon His lips.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
