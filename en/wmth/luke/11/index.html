The door is now barred, and I am here in bed with my children. I cannot get up and give you bread.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»I tell you that even if he will not rise and give him the loaves because he is his friend, at any rate because of his persistency he will rouse himself and give him as many as he requires.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»So I say to you, `Ask, and what you ask for shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For every one who asks, receives; and he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, the door shall be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And what father is there among you, who, if his son asks for a slice of bread, will offer him a stone? or if he asks for a fish, will instead of a fish offer him a snake?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>or if he asks for an egg, will offer him a scorpion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If you then, with all your human frailty, know how to give your children gifts that are good for them, how much more certainly will your Father who is in Heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>On once occasion He was expelling a dumb demon; and when the demon was gone out the dumb man could speak, and the people were astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some among them said, »It is by the power of Baal-zebul, the Prince of the demons, that he expels the demons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Others, to put Him to the test, asked Him for a sign in the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And, knowing their thoughts, He said to them, »Every kingdom in which civil war rages goes to ruin: family attacks family and is overthrown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if Satan really has engaged in fierce conflict with himself, how shall his kingdom stand?–because you say that I expel demons by the power of Baal-zebul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if it is by the power of Baal-zebul that I expel the demons, by whom do your disciples expel them? They therefore shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if it is by the power of God that I drive out the demons, it is evident that the Kingdom of God has come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>»Whenever a strong man, fully armed and equipped, is guarding his own castle, he enjoys peaceful possession of his property;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but as soon as another stronger than he attacks him and overcomes him, he takes away that complete armour of his in which he trusted, and distributes the plunder he has collected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever is not gathering with me is scattering abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»When a foul spirit has left a man, it roams about in the Desert, seeking a resting-place; but, unable to find any, it says, `I will return to the house I have left;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and when it comes, it finds the house swept clean and in good order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more malignant than itself, and they enter and dwell there; and in the end that man's condition becomes worse than it was at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As He thus spoke a woman in the crowd called out in a loud voice, »Blessed is the mother who carried you, and the breasts that you have sucked.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»Nay rather,« He replied, »they are blessed who hear God's Message and carefully keep it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now when the crowds came thronging upon Him, He proceeded to say, »The present generation is a wicked generation: it requires some sign, but no sign shall be given to it except that of Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For just as Jonah became a sign to the men of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a token to the present generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Queen of the South will awake at the Judgement together with the men of the present generation, and will condemn them; because she came from the extremity of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; but mark! One greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There will stand up men of Nineveh at the Judgement together with the present generation, and will condemn it; because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and mark! One greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»When any one lights a lamp, he never puts it in the cellar or under the bushel, but on the lampstand, that people who come in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The lamp of the body is the eye. When your eyesight is good, your whole body also is lighted up; but when it is defective, your body is darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Consider therefore whether the light that is in you is anything but mere darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If, however, your whole body is penetrated with light, and has no part dark, it will be so lighted, all of it, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When He had thus spoken, a Pharisee invited Him to breakfast at his house; so He entered and took His place at table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now the Pharisee saw to his surprise that He did not wash His hands before breakfasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The Master however said to him, »Here we see how you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup or plate, while your secret hearts are full of greed and selfishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Foolish men! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But as to what is within, give alms, and instantly all is clean in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»But alas for you Pharisees! for you pay tithes on your mint and rue and every kind of garden vegetable, and are indifferent to justice and the love of God. These are the things you ought to have attended to, while not neglecting the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Alas for you Pharisees! for you love the best seats in the synagogues, and you like to be bowed to in places of public resort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Alas for you! for you are like the tombs which lie hidden, and the people who walk over them are not aware of their existence.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Hereupon one of the expounders of the Law exclaimed, »Rabbi, in saying such things you reproach us also.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Alas too for you expounders of the Law!« replied Jesus, »for you load men with cumbrous burdens which you yourselves will not touch with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Alas for you! for you repair the tombs of the Prophets, whom your forefathers killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>It follows that you bear testimony to the actions of your forefathers and that you fully approve thereof. They slew, you build.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>»For this reason also the Wisdom of God has said, `I will send Prophets and Apostles to them, of whom they will kill some and persecute others,'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>so that the blood of all the Prophets, that is being shed from the creation of the world onwards, may be required from the present generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Yes, I tell you that, from the blood of Abel down to the blood of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the House, it shall all be required from the present generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>»Alas for you expounders of the Law! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you yourselves have not entered, and those who wanted to enter you have hindered.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>After He had left the house, the Scribes and Pharisees commenced a vehement attempt to entangle Him and make Him give off-hand answers on numerous points,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>lying in wait to catch some unguarded expression from His lips.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
