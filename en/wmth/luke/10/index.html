And now go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Remember that I am sending you out as lambs into the midst of wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Carry no purse, bag, nor change of shoes; and salute no one on your way.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>»Whatever house you enter, first say, `Peace be to this house!'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if there is a lover of peace there, your peace shall rest upon it; otherwise come back upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in that same house stay, eating and drinking at their table; for the labourer deserves his wages. Do not move from one house to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»And whatever town you come to and they receive you, eat what they put before you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Cure the sick in that town, and tell them, »`The Kingdom of God is now at your door.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»But whatever town you come to and they will not receive you, go out into the broader streets and say,«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>»`The very dust of your town that hangs about us we wipe off as a protest. Only be sure of this, that the Kingdom of God is close at hand.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»I tell you that it will be more endurable for Sodom on the great day than for that town.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>»Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! For had the miracles been performed in Tyre and Sidon which have been performed in you, long ere now they would have repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However, for Tyre and Sidon it will be more endurable at the Judgement than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be lifted high as Heaven? Thou shalt be driven down as low as Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>»He who listens to you listens to me; and he who disregards you disregards me, and he who disregards me disregards Him who sent me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When the Seventy returned, they exclaimed joyfully, »Master, even the demons submit to us when we utter your name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»I saw Satan fall like a lightning-flash out of Heaven,« He replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I have given you power to tread serpents and scorpions underfoot, and to trample on all the power of the Enemy; and in no case shall anything do you harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless rejoice not at this, that the spirits submit to you; but rejoice that your names are registered in Heaven.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>On that same occasion Jesus was filled by the Holy Spirit with rapturous joy. »I give Thee fervent thanks,« He exclaimed, »O Father, Lord of Heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from sages and men of understanding, and hast revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for such has been Thy gracious will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is but the Father, nor who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son may choose to reveal Him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He turned towards His disciples and said to them apart, »Blessed are the eyes which see what you see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I tell you that many Prophets and kings have desired to see the things you see, and have not seen them, and to hear the things you hear, and have not heard them.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then an expounder of the Law stood up to test Him with a question. »Rabbi,« he asked, »what shall I do to inherit the Life of the Ages?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Go to the Law,« said Jesus; »what is written there? how does it read?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»`Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,'« he replied, »`with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole strength, and thy whole mind; and thy fellow man as much as thyself.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»A right answer,« said Jesus; »do that, and you shall live.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, desiring to justify himself, said, »But what is meant by my `fellow man'?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus replied, »A man was once on his way down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell among robbers, who after both stripping and beating him went away, leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now a priest happened to be going down that way, and on seeing him passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In like manner a Levite also came to the place, and seeing him passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a certain Samaritan, being on a journey, came where he lay, and seeing him was moved with pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He went to him, and dressed his wounds with oil and wine and bound them up. Then placing him on his own mule he brought him to an inn, where he bestowed every care on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The next day he took out two shillings and gave them to the innkeeper. »`Take care of him,' he said, `and whatever further expense you are put to, I will repay it you at my next visit.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»Which of those three seems to you to have acted like a fellow man to him who fell among the robbers?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»The one who showed him pity,« he replied. »Go,« said Jesus, »and act in the same way.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As they pursued their journey He came to a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed Him to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>She had a sister called Mary, who seated herself at the Lord's feet and listened to His teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Martha meanwhile was busy and distracted in waiting at table, and she came and said, »Master, do you not care that my sister is leaving me to do all the waiting? Tell her to assist me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>»Martha, Martha,« replied Jesus, »you are anxious and worried about a multitude of things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and yet only one thing is really necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion and she shall not be deprived of it.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
