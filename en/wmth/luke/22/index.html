But they feared the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Satan, however, entered into Judas (the man called Iscariot) who was one of the Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He went and conferred with the High Priests and Commanders as to how he should deliver Him up to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>This gave them great pleasure, and they agreed to pay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He accepted their offer, and then looked out for an opportunity to betray Him when the people were not there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the day of the Unleavened Bread came –the day for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus sent Peter and John with instructions. »Go,« He said, »and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat it.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>»Where shall we prepare it?« they asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>»You will no sooner have entered the city,« He replied, »than you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house to which he goes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and say to the master of the house, »`The Rabbi asks you, Where is the room where I can eat the Passover with my disciples?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»And he will show you a large furnished room upstairs. There make your preparations.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they went and found all as He had told them; and they got the Passover ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the time was come, and He had taken His place at table, and the Apostles with Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, »Earnestly have I longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for I tell you that I certainly shall not eat one again till its full meaning has been brought out in the Kingdom of God.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then, having received the cup and given thanks, He said, »Take this and share it among yourselves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for I tell you that from this time I will never drink the produce of the vine till the Kingdom of God has come.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then, taking a Passover biscuit, He gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, »This is my body which is being given on your behalf: this do in remembrance of me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He gave them the cup in like manner, when the meal was over. »This cup,« He said, »is the new Covenant ratified by my blood which is to be poured out on your behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet the hand of him who is betraying me is at the table with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For indeed the Son of Man goes on His way–His pre-destined way; yet alas for that man who is betraying Him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thereupon they began to discuss with one another which of them it could possibly be who was about to do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There arose also a dispute among them which of them should be regarded as greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But He said to them, »The kings of the Gentiles are their masters, and those who exercise authority over them are called Benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With you it is not so; but let the greatest among you be as the younger, and the leader be like him who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For which is the greater–he who sits at table, or he who waits on him? Is it not he who sits at table? But my position among you is that of one who waits on others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You however have remained with me amid my trials;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I covenant to give you, as my Father has covenanted to give me, a Kingdom–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>so that you shall eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones as judges over the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»Simon, Simon, I tell you that Satan has obtained permission to have all of you to sift as wheat is sifted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail, and you, when at last you have come back to your true self, must strengthen your brethren.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Master,« replied Peter, »with you I am ready to go both to prison and to death.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»I tell you, Peter,« said Jesus, »that the cock will not crow to-day till you have three times denied that you know me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then He asked them, »When I sent you out without purse or bag or shoes, was there anything you needed?«»No, nothing,« they replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>»But now,« said He, »let the one who has a purse take it, and he who has a bag must do the same. And let him who has no sword sell his outer garment and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I tell you that those words of Scripture must yet find their fulfilment in me: `And He was reckoned among the lawless'; for indeed that saying about me has its accomplishment.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»Master, here are two swords,« they exclaimed. »That is enough,« He replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>On going out, He proceeded as usual to the Mount of Olives, and His disciples followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But when He arrived at the place, He said to them, »Pray that you may not come into temptation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But He Himself withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed repeatedly, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>»Father, if it be Thy will, take this cup away from me; yet not my will but Thine be done!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared to Him an angel from Heaven, strengthening Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>while He –an agony of distress having come upon Him– prayed all the more with intense earnestness, and His sweat became like clots of blood dropping on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When He rose from his prayer and came to His disciples, He found them sleeping for sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>»Why are you sleeping?« He said; »stand up; and pray that you may not come into temptation.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While He was still speaking there came a crowd with Judas, already mentioned as one of the Twelve, at their head. He went up to Jesus to kiss Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>»Judas,« said Jesus, »are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Those who were about Him, seeing what was likely to happen, asked Him, »Master, shall we strike with the sword?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them struck a blow at the High Priest's servant and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>»Permit me thus far,« said Jesus. And He touched the ear and healed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to the High Priests and Commanders of the Temple and Elders, who had come to arrest Him, »Have you come out as if to fight with a robber, with swords and cudgels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>While day after day I was with you in the Temple, you did not lay hands upon me; but to you belongs this hour–and the power of darkness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they arrested Him and led Him away, and brought Him to the High Priest's house, while Peter followed a good way behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had lighted a fire in the middle of the court and had seated themselves in a group round it, Peter was sitting among them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>when a maidservant saw him sitting by the fire, and, looking fixedly at him, she said, »This man also was with him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied it, and declared, »Woman, I do not know him.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Shortly afterwards a man saw him and said, »You, too, are one of them.«»No, man, I am not,« said Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>After an interval of about an hour some one else stoutly maintained:»Certainly this fellow also was with him, for in fact he is a Galilaean.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>»Man, I don't know what you mean,« replied Peter. No sooner had he spoken than a cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>The Master turned and looked on Peter; and Peter recollected the Master's words, how He had said to him, »This very day, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he went out and wept aloud bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Meanwhile the men who held Jesus in custody repeatedly beat Him in cruel sport,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>or blindfolded Him, and then challenged Him. »Prove to us,« they said, »that you are a prophet, by telling us who it was that struck you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And they said many other insulting things to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>As soon as it was day, the whole body of the Elders, both High Priests and Scribes, assembled. Then He was brought into their Sanhedrin, and they asked Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>»Are you the Christ? Tell us.« »If I tell you,« He replied, »you will certainly not believe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if I ask you questions, you will certainly not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But from this time forward the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of God's omnipotence.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Thereupon they cried out with one voice, »You, then, are the Son of God?«»It is as you say,« He answered; »I am He.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>»What need have we of further evidence?« they said; »for we ourselves have heard it from his own lips.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
