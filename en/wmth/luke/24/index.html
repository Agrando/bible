He has come back to life. Remember how He spoke to you while He was still in Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>when He told you that the Son of Man must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then they remembered His words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and returning from the tomb they reported all this to the Eleven and to all the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The women were Mary of Magdala, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James; and they and the rest of the women related all this to the Apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the whole story seemed to them an idle tale; they could not believe the women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Peter, however, rose and ran to the tomb. Stooping and looking in, he saw nothing but the linen cloths: so he went away to his own home, wondering at what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On that same day two of the disciples were walking to Emmaus, a village seven or eight miles from Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and were conversing about all these recent events;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and, in the midst of their conversation and discussion, Jesus Himself came and joined them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>though they were prevented from recognizing Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»What is the subject,« He asked them, »on which you are talking so earnestly, as you walk?« And they stood still, looking full of sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered, »Are you a stranger lodging alone in Jerusalem, that you have known nothing of the things that have lately happened in the city?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»What things?« He asked. »The things about Jesus the Nazarene,« they said, »who was a Prophet powerful in work and word before God and all the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how our High Priests and Rulers delivered Him up to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we were hoping that it was He who was about to ransom Israel. Yes, and moreover it was the day before yesterday that these things happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, besides, some of the women of our company have amazed us. They went to the tomb at daybreak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and, finding that His body was not there, they came and declared to us that they had also seen a vision of angels who said that He was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thereupon some of our party went to the tomb and found things just as the women had said; but Jesus Himself they did not see.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»O dull-witted men,« He replied, »with minds so slow to believe all that the Prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Was there not a necessity for the Christ thus to suffer, and then enter into His glory?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them the passages in Scripture which refer to Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When they had come near the village to which they were going, He appeared to be going further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they pressed Him to remain with them. »Because,« said they, »it is getting towards evening, and the day is nearly over.« So He went in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But as soon as He had sat down with them, and had taken the bread and had blessed and broken it, and was handing it to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>their eyes were opened and they recognized Him. But He vanished from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Were not our hearts,« they said to one another, »burning within us while He talked to us on the way and explained the Scriptures to us?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they rose and without an hour's delay returned to Jerusalem, and found the Eleven and the rest met together, who said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»Yes, it is true: the Master has come back to life. He has been seen by Simon.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they related what had happened on the way, and how He had been recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While they were thus talking, He Himself stood in their midst and said, »Peace be to you!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Startled, and in the utmost alarm, they thought they were looking at a spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but He said to them, »Why such alarm? And why are there such questionings in your minds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See my hands and my feet–it is my very self. Feel me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see I have.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And then He showed them His hands and His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But, while they still could not believe it for joy and were full of astonishment, He asked them, »Have you any food here?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they gave Him a piece of roasted fish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and He took it and ate it in their presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And He said to them, »This is what I told you while I was still with you–that everything must be fulfilled that is written in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and the Psalms concerning me.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and He said, »Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and on the third day rise again from among the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that proclamation would be made, in His name, of repentance and forgiveness of sins to all the nations, beginning in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You are witnesses as to these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And remember that I am about to send out my Father's promised gift to rest upon you. But, as for you, wait patiently in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And He brought them out to within view of Bethany, and then lifted up His hands and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And while He was blessing them, He parted from them and was carried up into Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They worshipped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Afterwards they were continually in attendance at the Temple, blessing God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
