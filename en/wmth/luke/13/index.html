On the contrary, if you are not penitent you will all perish as they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or those eighteen on whom the tower at Siloam fell, do you suppose they had failed in their duty more than all the rest of the people who live in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I tell you, certainly not. On the contrary, if you do not repent you will all perish just as they did.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He gave them the following parable. »A man,« He said, »who had a fig-tree growing in his garden came to look for fruit on it and could find none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So he said to the gardener, »`See, this is the third year I have come to look for fruit on this fig-tree and cannot find any. Cut it down. Why should so much ground be actually wasted?'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>»But the gardener pleaded,« `Leave it, Sir, this year also, till I have dug round it and manured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If after that it bears fruit, well and good; if it does not, then you shall cut it down.'«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Once He was teaching on the Sabbath in one of the synagogues</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>where a woman was present who for eighteen years had been a confirmed invalid: she was bent double, and was unable to lift herself to her full height.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Jesus saw her, and calling to her, He said to her, »Woman, you are free from your weakness.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He put His hands on her, and she immediately stood upright and began to give glory to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Warden of the Synagogue, indignant that Jesus had cured her on a Sabbath, said to the crowd, »There are six days in the week on which people ought to work. On those days therefore come and get yourselves cured, and not on the Sabbath day.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord's reply to him was, »Hypocrites, does not each of you on the Sabbath untie his bullock or his ass from the stall and lead him to water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this woman, daughter of Abraham as she is, whom Satan had bound for no less than eighteen years, was she not to be loosed from this chain because it is the Sabbath day?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When He had said this, all His opponents were ashamed, while the whole multitude was delighted at the many glorious things continually done by Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This prompted Him to say, »What is the Kingdom of God like? and to what shall I compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is like a mustard seed which a man drops into the soil in his garden, and it grows and becomes a tree in whose branches the birds roost.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again He said, »To what shall I compare the Kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is like yeast which a woman takes and buries in a bushel of flour, to work there till the whole is leavened.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He was passing through town after town and village after village, steadily proceeding towards Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>when some one asked Him, »Sir, are there but few who are to be saved?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>»Strain every nerve to force your way in through the narrow gate,« He answered; »for multitudes, I tell you, will endeavour to find a way in and will not succeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As soon as the Master of the house shall have risen and shut the door, and you have begun to stand outside and knock at the door and say, »`Sir, open the door for us' –«`I do not know you,' He answers; `you are no friends of mine.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»Then you will plead,« `We have eaten and drunk in your company and you have taught in our streets.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>»But He will reply,« `I tell you that you are no friends of mine. Begone from me, all of you, wrongdoers that you are.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>»There will be the weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and yourselves being driven far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They will come from east and west, from north and south, and will sit down at the banquet in the Kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I tell you that some now last will then be first, and some now first will then be last.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Just at that time there came some Pharisees who warned Him, saying, »Leave this place and continue your journey; Herod means to kill you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>»Go,« He replied, »and take this message to that fox: «`See, to-day and to-morrow I am driving out demons and effecting cures, and on the third day I finish my course.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>»Yet I must continue my journey to-day and to-morrow and the day following; for it is not conceivable that a Prophet should perish outside of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou who murderest the Prophets and stonest those who have been sent to thee, how often have I desired to gather thy children just as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>See, your house is left to you. But I tell you that you will never see me again until you say, `Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!'«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
