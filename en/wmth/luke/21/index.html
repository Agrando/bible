Do not go and follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when you hear of wars and turmoils, be not afraid; for these things must happen first, but the end does not come immediately.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then He said to them, »Nation will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there will be great earthquakes, and in places famines and pestilence; and there will be terrible sights and wonderful tokens from Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>»But before all these things happen they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you up to synagogues and to prison, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my sake.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the end all this will be evidence of your fidelity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Make up your minds, however, not to prepare a defence beforehand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for I will give you utterance and wisdom which none of your opponents will be able to withstand or reply to.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, friends; and some of you they will put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You will be the objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and yet not a hair of your heads shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By your patient endurance you will purchase your lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>»But when you see Jerusalem with armies encamping round her on every side, then be certain that her overthrow is close at hand.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then let those who shall be in Judaea escape to the hills; let those who are in the city leave it, and those who are in the country not enter in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For those are the days of vengeance and of fulfilling all that is written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>»Alas for the women who at that time are with child or who have infants; for there will be great distress in the land, and anger towards this People.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They will fall by the sword, or be carried off into slavery among all the Gentiles. And Jerusalem will be trampled under foot by the Gentiles, till the appointed times of the Gentiles have expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»There will be signs in sun, moon, and stars; and on earth anguish among the nations in their bewilderment at the roaring of the sea and its billows;«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>while men's hearts are fainting for fear, and for anxious expectation of what is coming on the world. For the forces which control the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then will they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when all this is beginning to take place, grieve no longer. Lift up your heads, because your deliverance is drawing near.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He spoke a parable to them. »See,« He said, »the fig-tree and all the trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As soon as they have shot out their leaves, you know at a glance that summer is now near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So also, when you see these things happening, you may be sure that the Kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»But take heed to yourselves, lest your souls be weighed down with self-indulgence and drunkenness or the anxieties of this life, and that day come upon you, suddenly, like a falling trap;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for it will come on all dwellers on the face of the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But beware of slumbering; and every moment pray that you may be fully strengthened to escape from all these coming evils, and to take your stand in the presence of the Son of Man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>His habit at this time was to teach in the Temple by day, but to go out and spend the night on the Mount called the Oliveyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And all the people came to Him in the Temple, early in the morning, to listen to Him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
