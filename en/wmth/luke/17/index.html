He was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>»Were not all ten made clean?« Jesus asked; »but where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Have none been found to come back and give glory to God except this foreigner?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He said to him, »Rise and go: your faith has cured you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God was coming, He answered, »The Kingdom of God does not so come that you can stealthily watch for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nor will they say, `See here!' or `See there!' –for the Kingdom of God is within you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then, turning to His disciples, He said, »There will come a time when you will wish you could see a single one of the days of the Son of Man, but will not see one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say to you, `See there!' `See here!' Do not start off and go in pursuit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For just as the lightning, when it flashes, shines from one part of the horizon to the opposite part, so will the Son of Man be on His day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first He must endure much suffering, and be rejected by the present generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>»And as it was in the time of Noah, so will it also be in the time of the Son of Man.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Men were eating and drinking, taking wives and giving wives, up to the very day on which Noah entered the Ark, and the Deluge came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The same was true in the time of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but on the day that Lot left Sodom, God rained fire and brimstone from the sky and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Exactly so will it be on the day that the veil is lifted from the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>»On that day, if a man is on the roof and his property indoors, let him not go down to fetch it; and, in the same way, he who is in the field, let him not turn back.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Any man who makes it his object to keep his own life safe, will lose it; but whoever loses his life will preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>On that night, I tell you, there will be two men in one bed: one will be taken away and the other left behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There will be two women turning the mill together: one will be taken away and the other left behind.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>»Where, Master?« they inquired. »Where the dead body is,« He replied, »there also will the vultures flock together.«</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
