and they were filled with terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the angel said to them, »Put away all fear; for I am bringing you good news of great joy–joy for all the People.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For a Saviour who is the Anointed Lord is born to you to-day, in the town of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this is the token for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And immediately there was with the angel a multitude of the army of Heaven praising God and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>»Glory be to God in the highest Heavens, And on earth peace among men who please Him!«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then, as soon as the angels had left them and returned to Heaven, the shepherds said to one another, »Let us now go over as far as Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they made haste and came and found Mary and Joseph, with the babe lying in the manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw the child, they told what had been said to them about Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and all who listened were astonished at what the shepherds told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Mary treasured up all these things, often dwelling on them in her mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen in accordance with the announcement made to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When eight days had passed and the time for circumcising Him had come, He was called JESUS, the name given Him by the angel before His conception in the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the days for their purification appointed by the Law of Moses had passed, they took Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>as it is written in the Law of the Lord: »Every first-born male shall be called holy to the Lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>During the passage He fell asleep, and there came down a squall of wind on the Lake, so that the boat began to fill and they were in deadly peril.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord, »a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now there was a man in Jerusalem of the name of Symeon, an upright and God-fearing man, who was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To him it had been revealed by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord's Anointed One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Led by the Spirit he came to the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do with regard to Him according to the custom of the Law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>»Now, O Sovereign Lord, Thou dost send Thy servant away in peace, in fulfilment of Thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Which Thou hast made ready in the sight of all nations–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>A light to shine upon the Gentiles, And the glory of Thy people Israel.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And while the child's father and mother were wondering at the words of Symeon concerning Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Symeon blessed them and said to Mary the mother, »This child is appointed for the falling and the uprising of many in Israel and for a token to be spoken against;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and a sword will pierce through your own soul also; that the reasonings in many hearts may be revealed.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>There was also Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, belonging to the tribe of Asher. She was of a very great age, having had after her maidenhood seven years of married life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and then being a widow of eighty-four years. She was never absent from the Temple, but worshipped, by day and by night, with fasting and prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And coming up just at that moment, she gave thanks to God, and spoke about the child to all who were expecting the deliverance of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then, as soon as they had accomplished all that the Law required, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the child grew and became strong and full of wisdom, and the favour of God rested upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Now His parents used to go up year by year to Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when He was twelve years old they went up as was customary at the time of the Feast, and,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>after staying the full number of days, when they started back home the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not discover this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>but supposing Him to be in the travelling company, they proceeded a day's journey. Then they searched up and down for Him among their relatives and acquaintances;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>but being unable to find Him they returned to Jerusalem, making anxious inquiry for Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>On the third day they found Him in the Temple sitting among the Rabbis, both listening to them and asking them questions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>while all who heard Him were astonished at His intelligence and at the answers He gave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When they saw Him, they were smitten with amazement, and His mother said to Him, »My child, why have you behaved thus to us? Your father and I have been searching for you in anguish.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>»Why is it that you have been searching for me?« He replied; »did you not know that it is my duty to be engaged upon my Father's business?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But they did not understand the significance of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was always obedient to them; but His mother carefully treasured up all these incidents in her memory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And as Jesus grew older He gained in both wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
