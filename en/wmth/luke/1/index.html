He had a wife who was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They were both of them upright before God, blamelessly obeying all the Lord's precepts and ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren; and both of them were far advanced in life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now while he was doing priestly duty before God in the prescribed course of his class,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>it fell to his lot –according to the custom of the priesthood– to go into the Sanctuary of the Lord and burn the incense;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the whole multitude of the people were outside praying, at the hour of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and Zechariah on seeing him was agitated and terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the angel said to him, »Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your petition has been heard: and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call his name John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Gladness and exultant joy shall be yours, and many will rejoice over his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; no wine or fermented drink shall he ever drink; but he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Many of the descendants of Israel will he turn to the Lord their God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he will be His forerunner in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn fathers' hearts to the children, and cause the rebellious to walk in the wisdom of the upright, to make a people perfectly ready for the lord.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>»By what proof,« asked Zechariah, »shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is far advanced in years.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>»I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God,« answered the angel, »and I have been sent to talk with you and tell you this good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now you will be dumb and unable to speak until the day when this has taken place; because you did not believe my words–words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, and were surprised that he stayed so long in the Sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When, however, he came out, he was unable to speak to them; and they knew that he must have seen a vision in the Sanctuary; but he kept making signs to them and continued dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When his days of service were at an end, he went to his home;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and in course of time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and kept herself secluded five months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>»Thus has the Lord dealt with me,« she said, »now that He has graciously taken away my reproach among men.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a maiden betrothed to a man of the name of Joseph, a descendant of David. The maiden's name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Gabriel went into the house and said to her, »Joy be to you, favoured one! the Lord is with you.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>She was greatly agitated at his words, and wondered what such a greeting meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the angel said, »Do not be frightened, Mary, for you have found favour with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You will conceive in your womb and bear a son; and you are to call His name JESUS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He will be great and He will be called `Son of the Most High.' And the Lord God will give Him the throne of His forefather David;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and He will be King over the House of Jacob for the Ages, and of His Kingdom there will be no end.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>»How can this be,« Mary replied, »seeing that I have no husband?«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The angel answered, »The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for this reason your holy offspring will be called `the Son of God.'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And see, your relative Elizabeth–she also has conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For no promise from God will be impossible of fulfilment.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>»I am the Lord's maidservant,« Mary replied; »may it be with me in accordance with your words!« And then the angel left her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Not long after this, Mary rose up and went in haste into the hill country to a town in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Here she came to the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the babe leapt within her. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and uttered a loud cry of joy. »Blest among women are you,« she said, »and the offspring of your body is blest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But why is this honour done me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For, the moment your greeting reached my ears, the babe within me leapt for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed is she who has believed, for the word spoken to her from the Lord shall be fulfilled.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Mary said: »My soul extols the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And my spirit triumphs in God my Saviour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Because He has not turned from His maidservant in her lowly position; For from this time forward all generations will account me happy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because the mighty One has done great things for me –Holy is His name!–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And His compassion is, generation after generation, Upon those who fear Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He has manifested His supreme strength. He has scattered those who were haughty in the thoughts of their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He has cast monarchs down from their thrones, And exalted men of low estate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The hungry He has satisfied with choice gifts, But the rich He has sent empty-handed away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>His servant Israel He has helped, Remembering His compassion–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In fulfillment of His promises to our forefathers–For Abraham and his posterity for ever.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now when Elizabeth's full time was come, she gave birth to a son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>and her neighbours and relatives heard how the Lord had had great compassion on her; and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and were going to call him Zechariah, after his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>His mother, however, said, »No, he is to be called John.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>»There is not one of your family,« they said, »who has that name.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>They asked his father by signs what he wished him to be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>So he asked for a writing-tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« And they all wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Instantly his mouth and his tongue were set free, and he began to speak and bless God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And all who lived round about them were filled with awe, and throughout the hill country of Judaea reports of all these things were spread abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>All who heard the story treasured it in their memories. »What then will this child be?« they said. For the lord's hand was indeed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Zechariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke in a rapture of praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>»Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,« he said, »Because He has not forgotten His people but has effected redemption for them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And has raised up a mighty Deliverer for us In the house of David His servant–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>As He has spoken from all time by the lips of His holy Prophets–</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>To deliver us from our foes and from the power of all who hate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>He dealt pitifully with our forefathers, And remembered His holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>The oath which He swore to Abraham our forefather,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>To grant us to be rescued from the power of our foes And so render worship to Him free from fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>In piety and uprightness before Him all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And you moreover, O child, shall be called Prophet of the Most High; For you shall go on in front before the Lord to prepare the way for Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>To give to His People a knowledge of salvation In the forgiveness of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Through the tender compassion of our God, Through which the daybreak from on high will come to us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>Dawning on those who now dwell in the darkness and shadow of death–To direct our feet into the path of peace.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew and became strong in character, and lived in the Desert till the time came for him to appear publicly to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
