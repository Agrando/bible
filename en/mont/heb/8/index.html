"See", he says, "that you make everything on the pattern showed you on the mountain."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus has obtained a better ministry, by so much as he is also Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But finding fault with them, He says. "There are days coming," says the Lord, "When I will establish with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Not according tot he covenant which I made with their forefathers,  On the day when I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt; For they did not continue in my covenant, And therefore I disregarded them," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel, After these days," says the Lord; "I will put my laws into their minds, And upon their hearts will I write them; And I will be their God, And they shall be my people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they shall not teach every man his fellow citizen, And every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; For all shall know me, From the least to the greatest of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will have mercy upon their wrong-doings, And their sins I will remember no more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By calling the covenant "new," He has made the first one obsolete;  and whatever is becoming obsolete and aged, is near to vanishing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
