Before his translation he had witness borne to him that he pleased God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>now without faith it is impossible to please him; for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and that he ever rewards those who are seeking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith Noah, warned of God of things not yet seen, reverently gave heed, and built an ark for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out unto a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It was by faith that he sojourned in the promised land as an alien,  living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, his fellow heirs of the same promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he continually looked for the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed,  although she was past the age for child-bearing, because she counted Him faithful who had promised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and thus there sprang from one man, and him practically dead, a nation like the stars in the heavens in multitude, or grains of sand upon the seashore, innumerable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These all died in faith, not having yet received the promises; nay,  but they saw them from afar, and hailed them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For those who say such things make it plain that they are seeking a Fatherland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if they had cherished the memory of that land from which they went out, they would have found an opportunity to return;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but now they are longing for a better homeland, that is, a heavenly.  Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; and he has prepared a city for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, when he was put to the test, was on the point of offering up Isaac; yes, he who had received the promise was about to offer up his only son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>of whom it had been said, It is through Isaac that your posterity will be traced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he accounted God able even to raise from the dead, from whence,  figuratively speaking, he did indeed receive him back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Josephs sons,  and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, when his end was nigh, made mention of the exodus of the children of Israel, and gave instructions in regard to his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the kings decree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He accounted the obloquy of Christ to be greater than the treasures of Egypt; for he fixed his eyes on the reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he left Egypt, not because he feared the wrath of the king,  but he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith he established the Passover, and the sprinkling with blood,  in order that the Destroying Angel might not touch the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith the people crossed over the Red Sea as on dry land; and when the Egyptians tried to do this they were swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith Rahab, the harlot, perished not with the disobedient,  because she had received the spies in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what more shall I say? for time would fail me to tell of Gideon,  of Barak, of Samson, and of Jeptha; of David and Samuel and the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who through faith conquered kingdoms, wrought righteousness,  obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, proved valiant in warfare, and routed armies of aliens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Woman received their dear ones alive from the dead; and others were broken on the wheel, not accepting the offered deliverance, in order that they might obtain a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Others again bore trial of mockings and scourgings, yes, even of chains and imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tempted, they were slain with the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, persecuted, tormented -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>of whom the world was not worthy - wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Yet, though these all had witness borne to them by their faith, they received not the promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>since it was for us that God had in store some better thing, so that apart from us they should not be perfected.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
