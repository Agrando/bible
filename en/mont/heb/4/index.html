But the message they heard was of no benefit to them, because they did not share the faith of those who gave heed to it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We are actually entering into that rest, we who have believed, as God has said, -In my wrath I swore - "They shall not enter into my Rest," although his works were finished since the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he has said, somewhere, regarding the seventh day, And God rested on the seventh day from all his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And again in this passage, They shall not enter into my rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Since, then, it remains that some should enter into it, and since those who formerly had the Good News preached to them did not enter in because of unbelief,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>he again fixes a day, saying long afterward by Davids lips, in words already quoted, Today if you hear his voice, Continue not to harden your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So there remains a Sabbath Rest for the people of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever has entered into his rest has rested from his works,  just as God did from his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let us, then, be earnest to enter into that rest, so that no one may fall into the same example of disobedience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For living is the Word of God, and active, and sharper than any two-  edged sword, piercing even to the severance of soul form spirit, of both joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the very thoughts and conceptions of the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there is not a creature hidden form him, but all things are naked and laid prostrate before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Inasmuch, then, as we have a great High Priest, Jesus, the Son of God, who has passed through the heavens, let us hold fast our confession of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we have not a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let us, then, draw near with glad boldness to the throne of grace,  that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help us in our times of need.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
