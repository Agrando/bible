He was first, as his name signifies, King of righteousness, and then King of Salem, that is, King of Peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>without father or mother, without lineage, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God, he remains a priest in perpetuity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But observe how great this man was, to whom even Abraham, the Patriarch, gave a tenth part of the spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now those of the sons of Levi who are appointed to the priesthood,  are authorized by the Law to take tithes of the people, that is, of their brothers, and that too, although these are descended from Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this man who had no Levitical genealogy actually took tithes of Abraham, and blessed him to whom the promises belong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now it is beyond all controversy that the inferior is always blessed by the superior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again it is mortal men who receive tithes in the one case; while in the other it is he of whom it is attested, "He lives."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And even Levi, who is the receiver of tithes, so to speak, paid tithes through Abraham;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for Levi was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedek met Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now if there were perfection through the Levitical priesthood, (and it was under it that the people received the Law) why was it still necessary for another kind of priest to arise, after the order of Melchisedek, instead of being reckoned according to the order of Aaron?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For when the priesthood changes, of necessity the law also changes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who is thus described belonged to another tribe, not one member of which has ever served at the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe of which Moses said nothing concerning the priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is yet more abundantly clear if, after the likeness of Melchisedek, there arises another Priest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who has become such, not according to the law of a transitory enactment, but according to the energy of an indissoluble life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the words are in evidence, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchisedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For there is a setting aside of a foregoing commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(for the Law brought nothing to perfection); and there is the bringing in of a better hope by which we draw near to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>mightier because it was not promised apart from an oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For although those priests became such without an oath, He had an oath form God who said to him, The Lord hath sworn and will not change, Thou art a priest forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And by so much Jesus becomes the guarantor of a better covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they indeed have been made priests, many in number, because they have been prevented by death from continuing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but he, because of his abiding forever, holds his priesthood inviolable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Hence also he is able to continue saving to the uttermost those who are ever drawing near to God through him, seeing that he is ever living to intercede for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For we needed just such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled,  separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>one who has no need, like the high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people. For his sacrifice was made once for all, when he offered up himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the Law appoints human beings to be high priests, men with all their weakness; but the word of the oath, which was later than the Law, appoints a Son, perfected forevermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
