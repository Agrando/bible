What can man do to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember your leaders, the men who spoke the message of God to you;  consider the issue of their lives, and imitate their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not allow yourselves to be swept away by various and strange teachings. For it is a beautiful thing to be established in heart by grace, and not by regulations regarding food, from which those that occupied themselves with them have derived no benefit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We Christians have an altar from which those have no right to eat who minister in the Tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the bodies of the animals whose blood is carried by the High Priest into the Holy Place are burned outside the camp,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and so Jesus suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people by his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us then go forth to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we have not here an abiding city, but we are earnestly seeking the city that is to be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In his name, then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is the fruit of lips that confess his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And forget not to be kind and liberal; for with that sort of sacrifice God is well pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Obey your leaders and submit to them; for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who must give account; that they may do thus with joy and not with lamentation, for this would be unprofitable to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Keep on praying for me. I am persuaded that I have a clear conscience, and I desire in every way to live nobly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I the more earnestly ask for your prayers, that I may be the more speedily restored to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus,  that great Shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of an eternal covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>equip you in every good deed for the doing of his will, doing in you what is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory unto the ages of the ages! Amen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I entreat you, brothers, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You know that our brother Timothy has been set free. If he comes soon, I will see him with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Salute all your leaders and the saints. The brothers from Italy send you greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Grace be with you all, Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
