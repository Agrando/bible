Thou art my Son; this day have I become thy Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and again, Thou art a priest forever, after the order of Melchisedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the days of his flesh, with better cries and weeping Jesus offered up prayers and supplications to Him who was able to save him out of death; and he was heard because of his devout submission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though he was a son, yet learned he obedience through the things which he suffered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and by being thus made perfect, he became the source of enduring salvation to all who obey him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>while God himself pronounced him High Priest according to the order of Melchisedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Concerning him I have much to say, and much that is hard to make clear to you, because you have grown dull of hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this too, although you ought by this time to be teaching others,  you are still needing some one to teach you the very rudiments of divine revelation. You need milk, not solid food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For every one who feeds on milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness. He is still an infant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But solid food is for adults, that is, for those who by constant practise have their faculties trained to discriminate between good and evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
