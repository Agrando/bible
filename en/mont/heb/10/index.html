Because the worshippers having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But on the other hand, in these sacrifices sins are called to memory, year after year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It is for this reason that the Christ, on coming into the world,  declared. Sacrifice and offerings thou dost not desire, But a body didst thou prepare for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In whole burnt offerings and sin offerings Thou hast taken no pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, "I am come - in the roll of the book it is written of me-  -To do thy will, O God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>First when it is said, Thou hast no longing for, thou takest no delight in Sacrifices and offerings, or whole burnt offerings and sin offerings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(offerings regularly made under the law), and then it is added, Lo,  I come to do thy will, he does away with the first, in order that he may establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it is by this will that we have been sanctified by the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For while every priest stands, day after day, at his ministrations,  and many times repeats the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>this Priest, after offering one Sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on Gods right hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>henceforth waiting until his enemies be put as the footstool of his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one single offering he has perfected forever those whom he is sanctifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Holy Spirit also gives his testimony, when he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"This is the covenant I will make with them After those days," says the Lord. "I will set my laws upon their hearts, And I will inscribe them on their minds."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he adds, And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But when these have been remitted, there is no more any offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Since, then, we have a cheerful confidence, brothers, to enter into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by the way which he dedicated for us, that new and living way,  through the veil (that is, his flesh);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and since we have a great High Priest over the house of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, our hearts sprinkled from and evil conscience, and our bodies bathed in pure water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope, unwavering (for He is faithful who promised);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and let us consider one another, to provoke unto love and good works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the custom of some, but exhorting one another; all the more as you behold the Day drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we sin wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains any other sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fiery indignation which is about to devour the adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Any one who set at naught the law of Moses was put to death without pity, on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>How much surer, think you, will be the punishment of one who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has profaned that covenant blood with which he was sanctified, and has done despite to the spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know Him who said, Vengeance is mine, I will repay, and again, The Lord will judge his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>IT IS A FEARFUL THING TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE LIVING GOD!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But ever call to mind the former days, in which, after having been enlightened, you endured a great conflict of sufferings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>partly by being made a public spectacle in reproaches and afflictions, and partly by sharing the fortunes of those that were so used.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For you did sympathize with the prisoners, and you did take joyfully the confiscation of your goods; conscious that you had for yourselves greater, even lasting possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now do not fling away your bold confidence, for it has a great recompense of reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For you need stedfastness, so that after having done the will of God, you may receive the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For yet a very, very little while, and then The Coming One will have come, without delay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But it is by faith that my Righteous One will live, And if he draws back, my soul takes no pleasure in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"But we are not of defections unto perdition, but of faith unto the gaining of the soul."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
