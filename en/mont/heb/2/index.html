What is Man, that thou art mindful of him? Or any man, that thou carest for him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou hast made him only a little lower that the angels; With glory and honor hast thou crowned him; And hast set him to govern the works of thy hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thou hast put all things under his feet. For this putting all things under man means leaving nothing not subject to him. But we do not yet see all things subject to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What we do see is Jesus, who was made for a time a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor, because of the suffering of death, in order that through Gods grace he might taste death for every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it befitted him, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both he who sanctifies and those whom he is sanctifying are all from One; for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,  saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will proclaim thy name to my brothers; In the midst of the Church I will hymn thy praises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, I myself will put my trust in God. And again, Lo, I and the children God has given me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, since the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also similarly partook of the same, in order that through death he might render powerless him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And might deliver those who through fear of death had been subject to life-long bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For assuredly it is not angels, nay, it is the offspring of Abraham,  whom he is ever taking by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And so it was necessary that he should in all points be made like his brothers, so that he might become a compassionate and faithful high priest, in all that relates to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For inasmuch as he himself has suffered, being tempted, he is also able instantly to succor those who are tempted, he is also able instantly to succor those who are tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
