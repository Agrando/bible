For while Moses also was faithful in all Gods house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built a house has higher honor than the house itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For every house has its builder; but he who built the universe is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, bearing testimony to a witness about to be spoken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but Christ as a Son in his own house; and we are that house, if we retain the cheerful courage and pride of our hope firm unto the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says. If you hear Gods voice today,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Continue not to harden your hearts as in the Provocation, On the day of temptation in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When your forefathers tried my forbearance And saw my deeds for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this reason I was sore displeased with that generation, And said, "They are always wandering in their hearts; They have never learned my ways";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So I swore in my wrath, "They shall never enter into my rest."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>See to it, brothers, that there shall never be in any one of you an evil and unbelieving heart, manifesting itself in apostasy from the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On the contrary, encourage each other daily, so long as there is a "Today," so that no one of you is hindered by the deceitfulness of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we are become comrades of the Christ, if we hold our first title deed firm until the very end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the words of Scripture, Today, if you hear his voice, Do not continue to harden your hearts as at the Provocation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For who were they that heard and yet provoked him? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And with whom was he grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, and whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to whom did he swear that they should never enter into his rest,  if not to those who had proved faithless? So you see that it was through unbelief that they were not able to enter in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>missing fehlt/missing</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
