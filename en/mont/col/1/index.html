Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Whenever I pray for you I am continually thanking God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>(since I heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love to all the saints)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Long ago you heard of this hope in the message which came to you of the truth of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And just as it is spreading through the whole world, bearing fruit and increasing, so also is it among you, from the day in which you heard it, and came truly to know the grace of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>as you learned it from Epaphras, our dearly loved fellow slave. He is a faithful minister of Jesus Christ in your behalf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and it is he who has told me of your love for me in the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this reason from the day I heard of it I have never ceased to pray for you, asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will with every kind of wisdom and spiritual insight;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that you may walk worthy of the Lord in every kind of pleasing; that you may be fruitful in every kind of good work, and may increase in the knowledge of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>that you may be strengthened in every kind of strength by the might of his glory for every kind of patience and fortitude with good cheer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I ask that you may give thanks to the Father who has made us fit to receive our share of the heritage of the saints in the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he has delivered us out of the dominion of the darkness, and transplanted us into the kingdom of his dear Son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He is a visible image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for in him was the universe created, things in heaven and on earth,  the seen and the unseen, thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; by him and for him all have been created;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and HE IS before all, and in him all things subsist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He is the head of his Body, the Church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, in order that in all things he may become preeminent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For in him all the divine fulness chose to dwell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and by him it chose to reconcile all things alike on earth or in heaven to himself; making peace by him, through the blood of his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you, alienated as you once were, hostile at heart in your evil deeds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>he has now in his human body reconciled to God by his death, in order that he may bring you into his presence, holy and unblemished and irreproachable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this he will do if, indeed, you continue in the faith, firmly founded and stedfast, and never moved away from the hope of the gospel which you heard, and which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, that gospel of which I, Paul, was made a minister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I am now rejoicing in my sufferings on your behalf; and I am filling up in my own body what is yet lacking of the sufferings of Christ in behalf of the church, his Body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is of this I was made a minister, according to the stewardship entrusted to me by God for you, fully to declare Gods message;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that secret truth, which, although hidden from ages and generations of old, has now been made manifest to his saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To them God willed to make known among the Gentiles how glorious are the riches of that secret truth, which is "Christ in you, the hope of glory."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Him I am ever proclaiming, warning every one and teaching every one,  in all wisdom; that I may bring every man into his presence, full grown in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For that end I am ever toiling, wrestling with all that energy of his which is mightily at work within me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
