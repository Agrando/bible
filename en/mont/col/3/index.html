Anger, passion, and ill-  will must be put away; slander, too, and foul talk, so that they may never soil your lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lie not one to another, but strip off the old self with its doings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and put on that new self which is continually made over according to the likeness of its Creator, into full understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In it that new creation there is no "Greek and Jew," "circumcised and uncircumcised," "barbarian," "Scythian," "slave," "free man," but Christ is all, and in us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, as Gods chosen people, consecrated and beloved, clothe yourselves with tenderness of heart, kindness, humility, gentleness,  good temper;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>bearing with one another and forgiving each other, if any one has a grievance against another.

Teach and admonish one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, ever singing with grace in your hearts unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And whatever you do, whether in word of in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God our Father through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting for Christians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Husbands, be loving to your wives, and be not cross or surly with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is well pleasing in Christians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Fathers, do not harass your children, lest you make them spiritless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Slaves, obey in all things your earthly masters, not with eye-  service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of purpose, out of reverence for your Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And whatever you do, do it heartily as for the Lord, and not for men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You know that from the Lord you will receive reward of the inheritance, for you are the Lord Christs slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he who wrongs another will be paid back for his wrong-doing, and there will be no favoritism.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
