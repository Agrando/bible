You will be speaking to the winds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are, let us say, so many languages in the world, and none without its meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If then I do not know the force of expression, I shall seem a barbarian to the one who uses it, and he will seem a barbarian to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So also in your case, since you are ambitious for spiritual gifts,  seek to excel in them for the upbuilding of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So let him who speaks with tongues pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then? I will pray with my spirit, and I will pray also with my mind. I will praise God with my spirit, but I will praise him with my mind, also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if you in your spirit bless God, how shall he who fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen to your thanksgiving, when he does not know what you are talking about?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You on the one hand offer a good thanksgiving, but the other is not built up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thank God I speak with tongues more than you all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, so as to instruct others, than ten thousand in an unknown tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, do not become children in understanding; be babes in malice, but in understanding become mature men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the Law it is written. With men of other tongues, and by the lips of strangers, will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So then the gift of tongues is for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Accordingly, when the whole church assemblies, and everybody is speaking "with tongues," if there enter men unlearned or unbelieving,  will they not say that you are mad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all are prophesying when an unlearned or unbelieving man enters, he is convicted in conscience by your speaker, he feels himself judged by all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the secret depths of his heart are laid open. So he will fall upon his face and worship God, saying, "Of a truth, God is with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What follows, then, brothers? Whenever you meet together, each contributes something; a psalm, a sermon, a revelation, a tongue, an interpretation. Let all be done for edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any one speaks in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that in turn, and let some one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no one to interpret, let them keep silence in the church, and speak to themselves and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others exercise their judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if to one as he sits there some revelation is made, let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you can all prophesy one by one; so that all may be learning,  and all may be encouraged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace. This custom prevails in all the churches of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"In your congregation" you write, "as in all the churches of the saints, let the women keep silence in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak. On the contrary let them be subordinate, as also says the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they want to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a women to speak in church."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What, was it from you that the word of God went forth, or to you only did it come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any one thinks himself a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that what I am now writing you is a command of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any one disregard it he will be disregarded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So, my brothers, be ambitious for the gift of prophecy, and speak not against the gifts of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let everything be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
