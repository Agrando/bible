Eye has not seen, Nor ear heard, Neither have entered into mans heart The things which God has prepared For those who love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet God has unveiled them to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit fathoms everything, even the abysmal depths of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For what man knows the depths of man except the mans own inner Spirit? Even so, also, the Spirit of God knows the deeps profound of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which comes forth from God, that we may realize the blessings freely given us by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Of these high themes we speak in words not taught by human philosophy, but by the Spirit; interpreting spiritual things to spiritual men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The unspiritual man rejects the teachings of Gods Spirit; for him it is folly. He cannot understand it, for it is spiritually discerned,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the spiritual man discerns everything, yet is himself discerned by no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For what man understands the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct Him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
