Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?  Are you not my work in the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Even if I am not an apostle to others, to you at least I am; for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>This is my reply to my critics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Have I no right to claim food and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Have I no right to take a believing wife with me on my journey, as the rest of the apostles and the Lords brothers and Peter do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Are we the only ones, Barnabas and I, who have no right to give up manual labor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What soldier ever serves at his own expense? What farmer ever plants a vineyard and his flock and does not taste the milk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Am I saying this on human authority only, or does not the Law also say the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yea, in the Law of Moses it is written, Thou shalt not muzzle an ox while he is treading out the grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Is it the oxen that God is thinking about, or is it really said for our sakes? It was written for us; because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher in hope of getting a share of the crop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If I have sown for you the seeds of spiritual good, is it a great thing if I reap from you temporal goods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others share this authority over you, do not I far more? Yet I have not availed myself of it, but am patiently enduring; so that I may not in any way hinder the progress of Christs gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You know, do you not, that those who minister in the temple, and those who serve at the altar, get their portion of the sacrifices?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so the Lord ordained that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But for my part, I have never availed myself of any of these rights.  I do not say this to bring it about in my own case. I would rather die than let any one make void this boast of mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Proclaiming the gospel gives me no ground of boasting; for necessity is laid upon me; woe is me if I preach not the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I do this of my own accord, I have my pay; but if unwilling,  I have at least discharged my stewardship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What then is my wage? This, that I can make the gospel free where I carry it; and that I can refrain from using my rights as a preacher of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Though free from all men, I make myself the slave of all, that I may win the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To the Jews I am become like a Jew, that I may win Jews; to those under the Law, like one under the Law, though I am not under the Law,  myself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to those outside the Law, as one outside the Law, to win those outside the Law (though I am not outside the law of God, but inside the law of Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I am become weak to the weak, to win the weak. I am become all these things to all men that, by any and by all means, I may save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I am doing it all for the gospels sake, that I may become a copartner in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do you not know that in a foot-race, though all run, only one receives the prize? So run that you may win.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Every man who contends in the games continually trains himself by all manner of self-restraint. Now they do it to get a fading garland,  but we, one that is unfading.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For my part, then, I run with no wavering to the goal. I box not as one beating the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but I bruise my body and keep it in subjection, lest having called others to the contest, I should myself be disqualified.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
