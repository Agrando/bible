And if the world is to be tried by you, are you unfit to try such trifling cases?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you not know that we are to try angels? How much more, then, the affairs of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why then, if you have cases relating to earthly affairs which need to be decided, is it men who are absolutely nothing in the church whom you make your judges?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say this to shame you. Is it so that there is not among you a single wise man, capable of deciding between a man and his brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Must brother go to law with brother, and that, too, before unbelievers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Indeed, to say nothing more, the fact that you have lawsuits with one another is altogether a defect in you. Why not rather suffer injustice? Why not rather endure being cheated?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On the contrary, you yourselves are inflicting injustice and fraud,  and that upon your brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God?  Do not be deceived. None who are immoral, or idolaters, or adulterers, or catamites, or sodomites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>or thieves, or avaricious men, or drunkards, or foul-mouthed men, or extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Such were some of you, but you have washed away your stains, you have been consecrated, you have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"All things are lawful for me"? Yes, but not all things are good for me. "All things are lawful for me"? Yes, but I will not let myself be enslaved by the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Food is meant for the stomach, and the stomach for food"? Yes, but God will soon put an end both to the one and to the other. The body,  however, exists not for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the God who raised up our Lord will up-raise us also by his mighty power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You know, do you not, that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot?  God forbid!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that he who joins himself to a harlot is one with her in body? (For God says, The two shall become one flesh.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While a man who is united with the Lord is one with Him in spirit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee from immorality. Every other sin that a man commits lies outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do you not know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is within you, the Spirit whom you have from God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You are not your own; for you have been bought with a price,  therefore glorify God in your bodies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
