But knowledge puffs up, while love builds up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If a man thinks that he already has knowledge, he does not yet truly know as he ought to know;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but if a man loves God, he is known by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now as to eating food that has been offered to idols, we know well that an idol has no real existence in the universe, and that there is no God but One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For though there be so-called "gods," celestial of terrestrial, as indeed there are gods many and lords many,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>yet for there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But that "knowledge" is not possessed by all; but some, accustomed until now to the idol, eat food as that which has actually been offered to an idol, and so their conscience, being still weak, is defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now food does not bring us nearness to God. Neither if we eat do we gain any advantage, nor if we eat not, do we lose any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But see to it lest this right of yours become a stumbling-block to the weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if any one should see you, the possessor of "knowledge,"  reclining at table in an idols temple, would not his conscience, if he were weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So he is lost, this weak man, lost by your "knowledge." this brother for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In so sinning against your brothers, and in ever and again wounding their weak consciences, you are sinning against Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, if what I eat makes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, lest I make my brother to stumble.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
