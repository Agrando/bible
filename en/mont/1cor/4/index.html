Then each mans due praise will come to him from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now these things, brothers, I have applied in a figure to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that in us you might learn not to go beyond what is written; that none of you be puffed up for the one,  against the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who makes you a differ, brother? Or what have you that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why are you boasting as if you had not received it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you, forsooth, are already full, are you? You are already rich?  Without us you are already reigning? Yes, and I would that you did reign, so that we also might reign with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But it seems to me that God has exhibited us apostles, last of all,  like men doomed to death; for we are made a spectacle to the whole world, both to men and to angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Christs sake we are fools, but you are quite philosophic in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong; you are honorable, but we are outcast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even to his very hour we are enduring hunger and thirst and nakedness and blows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Homeless men, we toil, working with our own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure; when defamed, we conciliate. We have been made, as it were, scum-o-the-earth, the very refuse of the world, to this very hour!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not writing this to shame you, but to admonish you, as my beloved children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For though you have ten thousand tutors in Christ Jesus, you can have but one father. For in Christ Jesus I begot you through the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I beg you then to imitate my example.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>With this in mind I have sent Timothy to you. He is my dear and faithful son in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ;  the manner in which I ever teach everywhere in every church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But come to you I will, and that soon, if it please the Lord, and then I shall learn not the talk of these boasters, but their power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God is not in talk, but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Which do you want? Am I to come to you with a rod, or in a loving and tender spirit?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
