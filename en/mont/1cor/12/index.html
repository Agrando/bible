If all were hearing, where were smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body as it has pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If all were one member, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now there are many members, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you". nor again of head to the feet, "I have no need for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the contrary, we need those members of the body which seem to be weaker;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>upon those parts of the body which we esteem less honorable, we bestow more abundant honor, and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For whereas our comely parts have no need, God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that member in which lacked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there should be no disunion in the body, but that members mutual care for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When one member suffers, all the others suffer with it; and when one member is honored, all the members are glad with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God has appointed those in the church to be first of all apostles, second, prophets, third, teachers. then workers of miracles, healers, helpers, administrators, users of various kinds of "tongues."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? teachers? workers of miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Have all gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues?
