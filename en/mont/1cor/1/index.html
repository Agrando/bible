Paul, was he crucified for you? or was it into the name of Paul that you were baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am thankful to God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that no one can say you were baptized in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yes, I did baptize the house of Stephanas also, but I do not think I baptized any one else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ did not think I baptized any one else. For Christ did not send me forth to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel; and that not in philosophic words, lest the Cross of Christ should be made an empty thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the message of the Cross is indeed for those on their way to destruction, foolishness; but for us who are on our way to salvation it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thus it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the philosophers, And the prudence of the prudent will I confound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Sage, rabbi, skeptic of this present age - where are they all? Has not God made foolish the philosophy of the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For when, in the wisdom of God, the world by its philosophy knew not God, the world by its philosophy knew not God, it pleased God, by the foolishness of preaching, to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jews continue to ask for miracles and Greeks are ever wanting philosophy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we come preaching a crucified Messiah - to Jews a stumbling-  block, to Greeks foolishness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are the called, whether Jews or Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For consider your own calling, brothers, that not many wise in earthly wisdom, not many powerful, not many of noble birth, have been called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No, God has chosen the worlds folly to confound its philosophy; and the worlds weakness to confound its strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The worlds base things has God chosen, and the things that are not,  to bring to naught the things that are;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so that no mortal man should glory in his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It is of him that you are in Christ Jesus, whom God made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that as Scripture says, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
