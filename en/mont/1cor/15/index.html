I labored more abundantly than all the rest, yet not I, but by the grace of God that is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But whether it is I or they, thus do I preach, and thus you came to believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If then, we are preaching Christ, that he rose from the dead, how are some of you saying that there is no resurrection from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if there is no resurrection from the dead, then not even Christ has been raised;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, and vain also is your faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>More than that, we are detected in bearing false witness against God; because we testified of God that he raised Christ from the dead,  whom he did not raise, if indeed the dead rise not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the dead rise not, neither has Christ arisen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if Christ be not risen, your faith is vain, you are still in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>More than that, those who are sleeping in Christ have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all mankind most pitiable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now, now, Christ is risen from the dead, the first-fruit of those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since by man came to death, by man came also the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But each in his own order; Christ the first-fruits, then those who belong to Christ at his appearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And then the end, when he shall hand over his kingdom to God his Father, after he has abolished all rule and authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he must rule until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy that will be destroyed is Death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For He hast put all things under his feet, but in that quotation All things are put under him, it is evident that God is excepted, who put all things under Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For when everything is subjected to him, then the Son himself shall subject himself to Him who made them subject, that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are really not raised, why are they baptized for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yes, and why am I myself exposed to danger every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Every day I am facing death, my brothers, I affirm it by that pride in you which I have through Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If after the manner of men I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what good does it do me? If the dead do not rise, Let us eat and drink, For we shall be dead tomorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not deceive yourselves. Evil companions ruin good morals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wake up, do justly, cease from sin; for I say to your shame that some of you have no acquaintance with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will ask. "How are the dead raised? and with what body are they coming?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Foolish man! The seed you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when you sow the seed you are not sowing the body that it will become, but bare grain, of wheat perhaps, or some other grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives it what body he pleases, and to each kind of seed its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh; there is human flesh, another of fishes of animals, another of birds, another of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are both celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial; but the splendor of the celestial is one thing, and the splendor of the terrestrial is another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So it is in the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption,  It is raised in incorruption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Sown in weakness, It is raised in power;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The body sown is animal The body is raised is spiritual. If there is an animal body, there is also a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thus it is written. The first man, Adam, became a living being, the last Adam, a life-giving Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Now it is not the spiritual which is first, but the animal, and then the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Like him who was of earth, are the earthy; and like Him who is of heaven, are the heavenly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As we have borne the likeness of him who was of earth, so also let us bear the likeness of Him who is of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I tell you this, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor can corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Lo, I tell you a secret truth. we shall not all be sleeping, but we shall be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet sounds. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised,  incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For this corruptible must be clothed with incorruption, and this mortal must be clothed with immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when this mortal has been clothed with immortality, then will the words of Scripture come to pass, Death has been swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Where, Death, is thy victory? Where, Death, is thy sting?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But thanks be to God, who has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>So, my brothers beloved, stand firm, immovable, always abounding in work for the Lord, because you know that your toil is not fruitless in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
