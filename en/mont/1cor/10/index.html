The bread which we break, is it not a common participation in the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because we who are many are one bread, one body, for we all do share in the one loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look at Israel according to the flesh; are not those who eat the sacrifices in communion with the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What then shall we say? that an offering to an idol is anything? or that an idol is really anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On the contrary, what the heathen sacrifice they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to have communion with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and also the cup of demons; you cannot be partakers in the Lords table and in the table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What! would we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"All things are lawful," you say? But not all things are expedient;  "all things are lawful"; but not all build up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let not each one be always seeking his own, but rather his neighbors good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Eat anything that is for sale in the markets, asking no questions for conscience sake;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for the earth and its fulness are the Lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If one who is not a believer invites you to his house, and you wish to go, eat everything that is set before you, without asking questions for conscience sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if any one tells you, "This food has been offered in sacrifice,"  do not eat it, for the sake of him who told you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and for your conscience sake - his conscience, not your own. "But,"  you may object, "why should my freedom be decided upon anothers scruples of conscience?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I eat after giving thanks, why am I denounced for eating that for which I have given thanks?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because whether you are eating or whether you are drinking, you are to do it all for the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Do not be a cause of stumbling either to Jews of to Gentiles, or to the church of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For so I also try to please all men in every way, not by seeking my own good, but the good of the many, that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
