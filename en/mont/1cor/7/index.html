It is well for a man to have no intercourse with a woman,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>but because there is so much immorality let each man have his own wife; and let each women have her own husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Let the husband give his wife her due, and likewise the wife her husband. The wife is not mistress of her own person,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>but her husband is; and in the same way the husband is not master of his own person, but his wife is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do not refuse one another, unless it is only temporary and by mutual consent, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come together again, lest through your lack of self-control Satan begin to tempt you to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But what I have just said is by way of concession, not command.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I would that every one lived as I do; but each man has his own special gift from God, one this, another that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But to the unmarried, and the widows, I say that it is well for them to remain as I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If, however, they are not exercising self-control, by all means let them marry; for marriage is better than the fever of passion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But to those already married my commandment is - and not mine, but the Lords - that a wife is not to leave her husband;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(or if she has already left him let her either remain as she is, or be reconciled to him), and also that a husband is not to put away his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To the rest it is I who am speaking, not the Lord. If any brother has a wife who is not a believer, if he is willing to live with her,  let him not send her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a woman whose husband is not a believer, if he is willing to live with her, let her not separate from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through union with his believing wife; and the unbelieving wife, through union with her believing husband. Otherwise your children would be unholy, but now they are consecrated to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the unbelieving partner be determined to leave, separation let it be. In such cases the believing husband or wife is not under bondage. But it is into peace that God has called us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Only whatever be the lot in life to which God has assigned each one -  and whatever the condition in which he was living when God called him-  -in that let him continue. Such is the rule I give in all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So, was any man called, being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was any man called when he was uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing. Keeping Gods commands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whatever be the condition of life in which he was called, in that let him continue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Were you called in slavery? Let not that trouble you; but if you can become free make use of the opportunity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the Lords freedman; and in the same way, the free man who is called is Christs slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You have been brought with a price; do not become slaves to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Where each man stood when he was called, there, brothers, let him stay, close to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have no command from the Lord to give you concerning unmarried women; but I give you my opinion, and it is that of a man who,  through the Lords mercy, is deserving of your confidence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I think then, that in view of the time of suffering now imminent, it is best for a man to remain as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from the marriage bond? Do not seek for a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yet if you do not marry, you have not done wrong; and if a girl marries, she has not done wrong. Such people, however, will have trouble in worldy affairs, and I wish to spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Indeed, brothers, the time that remains to us has been shortened; so let those who have wives live as if they had none,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>let those who weep be as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and those who use the world as though using it sparingly. For the present phase of the world is passing away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So I want you to be free from all anxieties. An unmarried man is anxious about the Lords business, how he may please the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but a married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how he may please his wife, and he is divided in his mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Again, the woman who is widow, or the maid, is anxious about the Lords business, how she may be pure in body and in mind; but the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs, how she may please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It is in your own interest that I say this; not that I may entangle you in a snare, but that I may help you to serve the Lord with fitting and undistracted service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If, however, a father feels that he is not treating his virgin daughter in a seemly manner, in leaving her unmarried beyond the flower of her age, and so the matter is urgent, let him do what she desires; he commits no sin. Let the marriage take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>On the other hand, he who is firm in his purpose and is under no compulsion, but is free to carry out his own wishes, and who has determined to keep his daughter unmarried, does well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So he that gives his daughter in marriage is doing right, and he who keeps her unmarried will be doing right, and he who keeps her unmarried will be doing better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A wife is bound to her husband during his lifetime; but if her husband dies, she is free to marry whomever she will, provided it be in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier, in my judgment, if she remains as she is; and I think that I, too, have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
