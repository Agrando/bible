While there is among you jealousy and strife, are you not still unspiritual, and behaving like worldlings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere worldlings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Just ministers through whom you have believed, and each doing the work that the Lord gave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered, but God made the seed grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So neither is he who planted anything, nor he who watered, but God alone, who is making the seed grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now, though he who plants and he who waters are one, each will receive his own reward, according to his own service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are Gods fellow workers; and you are Gods field, you are Gods building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God vouchsafed me, like a skillful master-  builder, I have laid a foundation; but another will be building upon it. Let each take heed how he builds on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The foundation is already laid - Jesus Christ - and no man can lay another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On that foundation, if a man proceeds to build gold, silver,  precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, each mans work will be made manifest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Day will disclose it, for it dawns in fire, and the fire will test each mans work, of what quality it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any mans work - the building he has made - stands the test, he will be rewarded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any mans work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, as it were through the flames.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know what you are Gods sanctuary, and that the Spirit of God is dwelling within you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any one tear down Gods sanctuary, God will tear him down; for the sanctuary of God is holy, and that is what you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no one deceive himself. If any one of you supposes that he is wise in the philosophy of the present age, let him become foolish, so that he may be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the philosophy of this world is foolishness in Gods sight. It is written, He snares the wise in their own craftiness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, how futile they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So let no one make boast in men. For all things are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, things present or things to come; all things are yours;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and you are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
