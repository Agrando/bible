It is fitting that a woman should pray to God with her head unveiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nor does nature itself teach you that it is a disgrace to a man to have long hair,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but it is womans glory, because her hair has been given her instead of a veil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If, however, any one is inclined to be disputatious regarding such a custom, let him know that neither I nor the churches of God hold to such a custom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But in giving you the following instructions, I cannot praise you;  your solemn assemblies do more harm than good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To begin with, I am told - and I believe there is some truth in it -  that when you meet at a church there are divisions among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must needs be also parties among you, in order that the good may be tested and made known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again, when you meet together, there is no true eating of the Lords Supper;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for each one of you begins to eat his own supper; one goes hungry,  while another gets drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What! Have you no houses in which to eat or drink? or do you wish to show your contempt for the church of God, and to shame those who have no homes to eat in? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I certainly do not praise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I passed on to you the account, which I myself received from the Lord; how the Lord Jesus, on the very night he was betrayed, took bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and when he had given thanks, he broke it, saying, "This is my body,  broken for you; this do in memory of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way also, he took the cup after supper, saying. "This cup is the new covenant in my blood; do this, whenever you drink it,  in memory of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are proclaiming your Lords death until he come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he that eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthy must answer for a sin against the body and blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let each man scrutinize himself, and thus let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whoever eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks condemnation to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is why many among you are feeble and sickly, and many sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If however, we were judging ourselves aright, we should not now be condemned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but through our condemnation by the Lord, we are trained so that we may not be condemned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So, my brothers, whenever you come together for this meal, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If any one is hungry, let him eat at home, so that your meetings do not bring condemnation upon you. The other matters I will adjust when I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
