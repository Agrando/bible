The Lord is near you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not worry about anything; but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the peace of God, which passes all understanding, will stand guard over your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is worthy of reverence, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,  whatever is of good repute, if virtue is anything, if honor is anything, be always thinking about these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Put in practise also what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me; and the God of peace shall be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover, I greatly rejoiced in the Lord that now once more your care for me blossomed afresh; though indeed you did take thought in this matter, but you lacked the opportunity of expression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not that I speak as if I were in want, for at least have learned how to be content, whatever happens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know how to live humbly, and I also know how to bear prosperity.  In every place and under all circumstances I have been initiated into the secret of fulness and of hunger, of prosperity and of want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am strong for everything in Him who gives me strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Notwithstanding, you have acted nobly in making yourselves comrades in my trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you very well know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I had left Macedonia, no church but yourselves had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For even while I was still in Thessalonica, you sent once and again for my needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It is not your gifts I am eager for, but I am eager for the abundant profit that accrues to your divine account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I give you a receipt in full for all things abound. I am amply supplied with what you sent by Epaphroditus - an odor of sweet fragrance, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All your own needs my God will fully supply, according to his riches in glory, in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now unto our God and Father be the glory, forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me salute you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All the saints salute you, and especially the slaves of the Emperors household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirits.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
