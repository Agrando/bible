In any case, whether in pretence or in honest truth,  Christ is still preached, and in that I am rejoicing, yes, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that these things will turn out to my salvation through your prayers and a rich supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So it is my keen expectation and hope that I shall never feel ashamed, but that with fearless courage, now as hither to, Christ may be magnified in my body, whether by my life or by my death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For, with me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now, if life in the flesh, if this be the fruit of my toil - what to choose I do not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but am in a quandary between the two. I am perplexed. I have a strong desire to break camp and to be with Christ, which is far better;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but for your sakes it is more necessary that I should still live on in the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And because I am convinced of this, I know that I shall live, and go on working side by side with you all for your progress and joy in the faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that you may find me fresh cause of exultation in Christ Jesus,  because of my presence among you once more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only do lead lives worthy of the gospel of Christ; so that whether I come to see you or hear reports concerning you in my absence, I may know that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul,  enlisted in a common struggle for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and in no way terrorized by its enemies. For you fearlessness is a clear indication of coming ruin for them, but of salvation for you at the hands of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For it has been granted you in Christs behalf, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>while you wage the same conflict which you once saw in me, and now hear that I maintain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
