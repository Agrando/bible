If any one else claims a right to trust in them, far more may I;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew sprung from the Hebrews; as to the Law, a Pharisee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to the righteousness which comes through law, blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But what was once gain to me, that I have counted loss for Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In very truth I count all things but loss compared to the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.
