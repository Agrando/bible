Thus it will be my boast at the day of Christ that I have not run in vain, or toiled for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nay, even if my life is to be poured out as a libation upon the sacrifice and service of you faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will rejoice and congratulate you all; and in the same way you must rejoice and congratulate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you before long, so that I may be of good comfort when I learn the news concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no other like him with a genuine concern for your welfare,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for they are all seeking their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you know Timothys worth, how he has shared my servitude in furtherance of the gospel, like a son helping his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So I hope to send him, as soon as ever I see how it will go with me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but I trust in the Lord that I also shall come shortly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Epaphroditus, my brother and coworker and fellow soldier, who is your messenger and minister to my needs, I have thought it necessary to send to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for he has been homesick for you all, and distressed at your having heard of his illness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And indeed he was sick nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him,  and not on him only, but on me also so that I should not have sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore I have been the more eager to send him, in order that you may rejoice in seeing him again, and that I may have one sorrow less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him then in the Lord with all joy, and hold in honor men like him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for it was through the work of the Lord that he came near to death;  for he hazarded his very life to supply what was lacking in the help you sent me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
