In no wise will they escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that "the Day" should come upon you like a bandit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you are all sons of light, and sons of day. We are not of night nor of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So then let us not be sleeping as do the rest, but let us be watchful and self-controlled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For those who are sleeping, sleep in the night, and those who are drunken, are drunken in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But let us who are of the day be self-controlled, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to win salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He died for us, in order that whether we are keeping vigil in life or sleeping in death we may ever be living together with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So comfort one another, and try to build one another up, as indeed you are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I entreat you, brothers, to acknowledge those who are toiling among you and are your leaders in the Lord, and give you counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Esteem them very highly in love for their works sake.
