God is my witness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now was I seeking glory from men, either yourselves or others,  although I might have exercised authority as Christs apostle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the contrary I showed myself among you as gentle as a mother,  when she tenderly nurses her own children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So in my fond affection it was my joy to give you, not only the gospel of God, but my very life also, because you had become dear to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You recall, brothers, my labor and toil; how, while working at my trade day and night, so as not to become a burden to any of you, I proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You are witnesses - and so is God - how pure and just and blameless was my behavior among you believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You know how I was wont to treat each of you as a father treats his children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>exhorting and imploring and adjuring each one among you to lead a life worthy of the God who called you into his own kingdom and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this reason also I am giving continual thanks to God, because when you heard from me the spoken word of God, you received it not as the word of men, but as the word of God (which in truth it is), who himself is effectually at work in you believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For you, brothers, began to follow the example of the churches of God in Judea, which are in Christ Jesus; and you in your turn suffered at the hands of your fellow citizens persecutions like to those which they endured from the Jews -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The men who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out - they are displeasing to God, and are the enemies of all mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They forbid me to speak to the Gentiles with a view to their salvation. They continue always to fill up the measure of their sins;  but the wrath of God is come upon them to the full!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But I, my brothers, although torn from you for a short season (in presence, not in heart), made eager efforts to behold you face to face with strong longing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For that reason I would fain have visited you - I, Paul, again and again - but Satan hindered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what is my hope, or joy? What is the victors wreath in which I exult? What but your own selves in the presence of our Lord Jesus, at his coming! For you are my pride and my delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>missing fehlt/missing</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
