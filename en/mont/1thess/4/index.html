But I exhort you, brothers, to abound in this yet more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Also, that you endeavor to live quietly and to mind your own business, and to work with your hands (as I charged you).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So that your conduct may be seemly toward those that are without,  and that you may not need help from any man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I would not have you ignorant, brothers, about those who are falling asleep. You must not sorrow like other men, who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if we really believe that Jesus died and rose again, so even so will God through Jesus bring with him those also who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this I tell you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living,  who survive unto the coming of the Lord, will in no wise precede those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord himself with a shout, with the voice of an archangel,  and with the trumpet of God will descend from heaven. Then the dead in Christ will rise first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And afterwards we who are alive, who remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So comfort one another with these words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
