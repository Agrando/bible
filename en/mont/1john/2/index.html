By this we come to know that we are in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>By who says he "remains in him" ought to spend his life as he spent his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, I am not writing a new commandment to you, nay, and old commandment, which you have had from the beginning. That old commandment is the message to which you have listened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet again it is a new commandment which I am writing to you, which is true in him and is you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But he who loves his brother is abiding in the light, and in it there is no cause of stumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and is spending his life in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I am writing to you, little children, because you sins are forgiven you for his names sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have fully overcome the Evil One. I have written to you, little children, because you have learned to know the father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have written to you, fathers, because you have learned to know him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God is abiding in you, and you have fully overcome the Evil One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the proud glory of life, is not from the Father, but from the world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the world and its lusts are passing away, but he who ever does the will of God abides forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My children, this is the last hour, and as you have heard that an antichrist was coming, and now many antichrists are already risen,  whence we may know that it is the last hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came forth from us, but they did not belong to us. If they had belonged to us they would certainly have remained with us, but they went out that they might be manifest that they all are not of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I am not writing to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it, and know that no lie is of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is the liar if not the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ?  This is the Antichrist, even he who disowns the Father and the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whoever denies the Son, the same has not the Father; but he who confesses the Son has the Father also. As for you, let what you have heard from the beginning abide in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If what you have heard from the beginning is abiding in you, you also will ever abide in the Son and in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this is the promise which he has promised to us even life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have written this to you concerning those who would lead you astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As to you, the unction you received from him remains ever in you,  and you need no teaching from any one. But since his unction teaches you concerning all things and is true, and is no lie, abide continually in him, as it has taught you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now continue to abide in him, my children, so that when he shall appear we may have cheerful confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you know that he is righteous you know also that every one who habitually practises righteousness has been born of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
