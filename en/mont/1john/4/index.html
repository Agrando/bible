And this is that spirit of Antichrist of which you have heard that it is coming, and that now it is already in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My little children, you are of God and have conquered them; because he that is within you is greater than he that is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are of the world, and for this reason they speak as of the world, and the world listens to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you are of God. He who is beginning to know God listens to us;  he who is not of God does not listen to us. By this we may distinguish the spirit of truth from the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another; for love is of God; and every one that loves us a child of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who does not love, does not know God; for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this was the love of God clearly shown toward us, by his sending his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be a propitiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If God so loved us, beloved, we also ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No man has ever gazed on God; but if we love one another, God ever abides in us, and his love is perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By this we come to know that we are abiding in him, and he in us,  because he has given us of his Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and we have beheld and do testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any man confesses that "Jesus is the Son of God." God is abiding in that man, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we do know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love; and he who is abiding in love is abiding in God, and God is abiding in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In this is love made perfect with us, so that we may have cheerful confidence in the Day of Judgment, because we are living in this world as He lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Fear does not exist in love; but love, when it is perfect, drives out fear. For fear has always torment, and he who has fear is not yet perfected in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love because He loved us first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If any one says, "I love God," and yet hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot possibly love God, whom he has not seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And we have this command from God. HE WHO LOVES GOD IS TO LOVE HIS BROTHER ALSO.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
