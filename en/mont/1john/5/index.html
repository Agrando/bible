The spirit is he who bears testimony, because the Spirit is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three who bear testimony, the Spirit, and the water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the blood; and the three are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we accept mens testimony, the testimony of God is greater; for this is the testimony of God, that he has borne testimony concerning his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who believes on the Son of God has the testimony in himself. He who does not believe God, has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the testimony is this, "God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who has the Son has the life; he who has not the Son of God has not the life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have written these words to you so that you may know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the confidence which we have in him is this, that he listens to us whenever we ask anything that is in accordance with his will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he is listening to us in what ever we are asking, we know that we obtain the petitions which we have made to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any one sees his brother committing a sin that is not deadly, he shall ask, and God will give him life, for any one who is not committing a deadly sin. There is a deadly sin; concerning that I do not say that he should pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All unrighteousness is sin; and there is sin that is not deadly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that whoever is a child of God is not habitually committing sin; but he who is Gods child guards himself, and the Evil One never touches him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are of God, and the whole world is lying in the Evil One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we know that the Son of God is come, and has granted us and understanding, so that we may come to know him who is true. And we are in him who is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My little children, guard yourselves from idols.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
