To the churches of Galatia greeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Grace be to you, and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil age in accordance with the will of our God and Father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am amazed that you are so soon shifting your ground, and deserting him who called you by the grace of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for another gospel, which indeed is not another; only there are certain individuals who are troubling you, and desiring to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even though I myself or an angel from heaven were to preach any gospel other than that which I did preach to you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have said it before, and I now repeat it, if any one is preaching a gospel to you other than that which you have received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Think you that I am now trying to conciliate men or God? Or am I "seeking to please men"? If I were still seeking to please men, I should not be a slave of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel I preach is not man-made;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for neither did I myself receive it from man, nor by man was I taught it, but by a revelation an apocalypse of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how furiously I used to persecute the church of God, and how I kept seeking to root it out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and how in my zeal for Judaism I outstripped many of my own age and nation, in my special zeal for the traditions of my forefathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when God who had set me apart from my very birth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and had called me by his grace, was pleased to reveal his Son in me,  so that I might preach his gospel among the Gentiles, without consulting a human being,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>or even going up to Jerusalem to see those who had been apostles before me, I went off at once to Arabia, and on my return came back to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to get acquainted with Peter, and spent two weeks with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I saw no other apostle except James, the Lords brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(In what I am now writing, I call God to witness that I am telling the truth.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I went into the districts of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But to the churches of Christ in Judea I was personally unknown;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>only they used to hear it said, "He who was once persecuting us is now preaching the gospel of the very faith which he once tried to ruin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they were giving glory to God on my account.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
