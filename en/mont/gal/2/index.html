And I laid before them the gospel which I am wont to preach among the Gentiles.  I did this privately before those in authority, lest by any means I should be running, or should already have run, in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But although Titus, my companion, was a Greek, they did not compel even him to be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet there were false brethren who had crept in to spy out the freedom we enjoy in Christ Jesus, in order to enslave us again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>To them we did not yield submission even for an hour, in order that the truth of the gospel might abide unshaken among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But those in authority - what they once were makes no difference to me; God is no respecter of persons - those I say who were in authority had no additions to make my message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter has with the gospel for the circumcised</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(for he who has equipped Peter for the apostleship to the circumcised, equipped me also for the apostleship to the Gentiles),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and when they recognized the grace which had been given to me, James and Cephas and John, then thought to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and to me the right hand of fellowship. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They stipulated only that we should remember the poor, which very thing indeed I was quite eager to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when Cephas came to Antioch I resisted him to his face, because he stood self-condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For until certain men came from James he used to eat with the Gentile Christians, but when they came, he began to draw back and to separate himself, because he was afraid of the circumcision party.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the rest of the Jewish Christians also dissimulated with him, so that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when I saw that they were not walking a straight path, in the presence of the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all. "If you, although you are a Jew, live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, why do you try to compel the Gentiles to become Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"We are Jews by birth, and not Gentile sinners;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"yet because we know that no man is justified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, we ourselves also have put our faith in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law; for "By the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if while seeking to be justified in Christ we ourselves also have been found to be sinners, is Christ then a minister of sin? Far from it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if I am rebuilding the very things which I destroyed, I am proving myself a transgressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is through law I died to law, in order to live to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have been crucified with Christ, so it is no longer I who am living, but it is Christ who is living in me; and the life I am now living in the flesh, I am living in faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not annul the grace of God; for if righteousness comes by way of the Law, then indeed Christ died Christ for nothing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
