I, Paul, declare to you that if you are to continue to follow the rite of circumcision, Christ will be no profit to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I solemnly testify to every man who submits to circumcision that he obligates himself to keep the whole Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If you are being justified by law, you are cut off from Christ; you are fallen away from grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But we are not, for we through the Spirit are eagerly waiting by faith for a hope of righteousness (a hope well founded);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>because in Christ neither circumcision has any value, nor uncircumcision, but faith which works through love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You were running your race nobly. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The influence brought to bear does not come from him who is calling you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little leaven is leavening the whole lump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for me, I am fully trusting you in the Lord that you will be no otherwise minded; but he who is trying to unsettle you will have to bear his punishment, whoever he may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I, brothers, if I "still preach circumcision," why am I still persecuted? Then surely the stumbling-block of the Cross has ceased to be an obstacle!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Would to God that those who are trying to unsettle you would even have themselves mutilated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you, brothers, were called for freedom; only do not make your freedom an excuse for self-indulgence, but in love enslave yourselves to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the whole Law has been fulfilled in this one precept, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you are always biting and devouring one another, take heed lest you be utterly consumed one by another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is my meaning. Let your steps be guided by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the desire of the flesh is against that of the Spirit, and the desire of the Spirit is against that of the flesh, for they two are antagonistic, so that you may not do those things that you wish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are habitually led by the Spirit you are not under law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are manifest; such, for instance, as fornication, impurity, indecency,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idol-worship, sorcery, quarrels, party-spirit, jealousy, passionate anger, intrigues, factions, sectarianism,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envy, drunkenness, revelings, and things like these. I tell you beforehand, as I have already told you, that those who practise such sins shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the harvest-fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-  suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity, gentleness, and self-control;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>against such there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and appetites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we are living by the Spirit, let us also keep step in the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
