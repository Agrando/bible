As long as the heir is a child, he differs in no respect from a slave, though he be the owner of the whole inheritance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>but is under the control of guardians and trustees, until the time appointed by his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So we Jews also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the empty externalities of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when the fulness of time was come God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>to redeem from captivity those under law, in order that we might receive our sonship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And because you are sons, God sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, "Dear, dear Father!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So each one of you is no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son,  then an heir, too, through Gods grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But once, when you Gentiles had no knowledge of God, you were slaves to gods which have no real being.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, however, when you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you are beginning to turn back to those weak and beggarly externalities, eager to be in bondage to them again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You are scrupulous, are you, in observing "days" and "months" and "seasons" and "years"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am alarmed about you for fear lest I may have bestowed labor on you to no purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Brothers, I beseech you, become as I am, because I also have become as you are. You never did me any wrong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>on the contrary, you know that although it was illness which brought about my preaching the gospel to you at my first visit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and although my bodily affliction was a trial to you, you did not scoff at it nor spurn me, but welcomed me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why then did you account yourselves so happy? (For I bear you witness that if you could you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Am I then become your enemy, because I am telling you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These men are courting your favor to no good purpose. They want to isolate you, so that you will be courting their favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is always an honorable thing to have your favor sought in an honorable cause, always, and not only when I am with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O my little children, of whom I travail again in birth until Christ be formed within you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>How I wish I could be with you now, that I might change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you who wish to be subject to the Law, why do you not listen to the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and one by the free woman;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but while the son by the slave woman was born according to the flesh, the son by the free woman was born in fulfilment of a promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now all this is an allegory, for these women are the two covenants;  one from Mount Sinai, which is Hagar bearing children into bondage</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(for the word Hagar stands for Mt. Sinai in Arabia and represents the present Jerusalem who with her children is in bondage.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Rejoice, O thou barren one who dost never bear,  Break forth in joy, thou that dost not travail; For the children of the desolate woman are many. Yea, more than hers who has a husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But you, brothers, are like Isaac, children of the promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but just as in old times the son born by the flesh used to persecute the son born by the power of the Spirit, so also it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what does the Scripture say? Send away the slave-woman and her son; for the slaves son shall not be heir along with the son of the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So, brothers, we are the children of no slave woman, but of free woman. For freedom did not Christ set us free;</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
