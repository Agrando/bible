He had a wife named Elizabeth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who was a descendant of Aaron. They were both righteous in the sight of the Lord, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the law, blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now they had no child, for Elizabeth was barren, and both were far advanced in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now while Zachariah was acting as priest before God in the due course of his class, it fell to his lot, according to the custom of priesthood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>to enter into the sanctuary of the Lord and to burn incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the whole multitude of the people were without, praying at the hour of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he saw him Zachariah was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the Angel said to him. "Do not be afraid, Zachariah, because your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to call him John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"And he shall be to you a joy and an exultation, and many shall rejoice over his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, "He shall drink neither wine nor strong drink, "He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit from the hour of his birth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"And shall win many of the sons of Israel to the Lord, their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"He shall go before Him in the wisdom and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"How shall I be sure of this?" said Zachariah to the Angel. "For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"I am Gabriel," answered the angel, "who stand in the presence of God; and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring and to bring you this good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"And now you shall be silent and unable to speak until the day the day when this has taken place; because you did not believe my words -  Words which will be fulfilled at their appointed time."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zachariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he came out he could not speak to them, and then they knew that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept making signs to them and remained dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As soon as his term of priestly service was ended he went home;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and after those days Elizabeth, his wife, Conceived, and she hid herself five months, saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"This has the Lord done for me. He has now deigned to take the away my reproach among men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Six months later the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee, called Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a maiden betrothed to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David.  Her name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The angel went in and said to her. "Joy to you, highly favored one!  "The Lord is with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Mary was greatly agitated at his word, and was revolving in her mind what this salutation could mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>when the angel said to her. "Fear not Mary, for you have found grace with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"And behold, you shall conceive in your womb and bear a son; and you shall call his name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High.  "And the Lord God will give him the throne of his forefather David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"and he shall reign over the House of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Mary said to the angel. "How can this be? For I have no husband?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"The Holy Spirit shall come upon you," said the angel, "and the power of the most High shall overshadow you, and therefore the holy offspring which is born, shall be called the son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"And behold your kinswoman, Elizabeth, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this was the sixth month with her that was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"For no word of God shall be void of power."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Mary said. "Behold I am Lords slave. Let it be to me as you have said." Then the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Soon after this Mary set out and hastened unto the hill-country to a town in Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and there she came into the house of Zachariah, and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when Elizabeth heard her salutation, the babe leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and called out with a loud cry. "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"But why is this honor done me, that the mother of my Lord should come me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"For behold when the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped with joy within my womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"And blessed is she who believed that the Lords words spoken to her would be fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said. "My soul doth magnify the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"My spirit exults in the God, who is my Saviour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"For he has regarded the humiliation of his slave, And from this hour all ages will count me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"For he who is mighty has done great things for me; And holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>"His mercy is unto generations and generations on those who reverence him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"He has showed strength with his arm. "He has scattered proud in the imagination of their hearts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>"he has put down princes from their thrones, and has exalted those of low degree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>"The hungry he has filled with good things, But the rich he has sent empty away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>"He has helped Israel, his servant, that he might remember mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>"As he spoke to our forefathers, to Abraham and his offspring forever."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and returned home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now when the time of Elizabeths delivery was come, she gave birth to a son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>and her neighbors and kinsfolk heard that the Lord had magnified his mercy toward her; and they rejoiced with her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>and came on the eighth day to circumcise the child. They were about to call him "Zachariah," after his father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>when his mother said, "No, he is to be called John."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Said they, "You have no relatives of that name!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Then they asked his father by signs what he wished to call the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>So he asked for a writing tablet and wrote down, "His name is John."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Every one was surprised, and at once his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And there came a great fear upon all in the neighborhood; and throughout the hill country of Judea all these sayings were much talked about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>All the story laid it up in their hearts, saying "What, then, will this child be?" For the Lords hands was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And his father, Zachariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, For he has visited and redeemed his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>"And has raised up a mighty Deliverer for us In the house of his servant David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>"As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets Which have been since the world began</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>To deliver us from our enemies, and from the power Of all who hate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>"He showed mercy to our forefathers, He remembered his holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>"The oath which he swore to Abraham, our forefather,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>"That he we should be delivered out of the Hand of our enemies, And should serve him without fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>"In holiness and righteousness before him All our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>"And thou, child, shalt be called the Prophet of the Most High, For thou shalt go before the Lord to prepare the way</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>"To give to his people a knowledge of salvation Through the remission of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>"Through the heart of mercy of our God, Whereby the Dayspring from on high shall visit us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>"To give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, And to guide our feet into the paths of peace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew, and became strong in the Spirit, and remained in the desert till the day of his showing to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
