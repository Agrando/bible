His disciples were picking the ears and eating the wheat, rubbing it out with their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Have you never read," answered Jesus, "what David did when he and his followers were hungry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"How he entered into Gods house and took and ate the Presented Loaves, and gave some to his followers, loaves which none must eat but the priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"THE SON OF MAN," he told them, "IS LORD EVEN OVER THE SABBATH."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On another Sabbath he went into a synagogue and was teaching; and there was there a man whose right hand was withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now the Scribes and Pharisees kept watching to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might be able to bring on accusations to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He was all along aware of their thoughts; and he said to the man with the withered hand, "Rise, and stand there in the midst."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he rose and stood. Then Jesus said to them. "I ask you whether it is lawful on the Sabbath Day to do good or to do harm? To save a life or to destroy it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he looked round about on them in anger, and said to him,  "Stretch out your hand!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He did so; and his hand was restored. But they were filled with fury, and they began to talk over together what they could do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It happened about that time that he went out into the mountain to pray. He continued all night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when day dawned he called his disciples, and from among them he selected twelve, whom also he called Apostles missionaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They were Simon, whom he had also called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Philip and Bartholomew; Mathew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus,  Simon called the Zealot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jude the son of James, and Judas Iscariot who was the traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>With these he came down till he reached a level place, where there was a great crowd of his disciples and a great many people from all Judea and Jerusalem and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon. These came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Those who were tormented by unclean spirits were healed also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The whole crowd were trying to touch him, because power emanated from him and cured them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then raising his eyes upon his disciples he began to say to them.  "Blessed are you poor, For the kingdom of God is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Blessed are you who are hungry now, For you shall be filled.  "Blessed are you who are wailing now, For you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Blessed are you when men shall hate you, And excommunicate you and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil because of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Rejoice in that day and exult, For your reward is great in heaven;  For even so did their fathers to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"But woe to you rich! For you already have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Woe unto you who are full now! For you shall suffer hunger. "Woe to you who are laughing now! For you shall wail and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Woe to you when all men shall speak well of you! For even so did their fathers to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"But to you who are listening to me I say, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bless those who curse you, pray for those who calumniate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To him who gives you a blow on the jaw Turn the other jaw also; And from him who is robbing you of your cloak Withhold not your coat also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to every one who asks you; And do not demand your goods back from him who is taking them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you would like men to do to you, So do you also to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"If you love those who love you what credit is it to you? Why even sinners love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"And if you are kind to those who are kind to you, what credit is it to you? Even sinners do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"And if you lend to those from whom you are hoping to receive, what credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, so as to get as much back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"But you must love even your enemies and be kind to them, And lend,  despairing of no man. Then your reward will be great, And you will be the sons of the Most High; For he is kind even to the ungrateful and to the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Do you therefore be merciful, As your Father is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Do not judge, and you shall not be judged; Do not condemn, and you shall not be condemned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"Pardon, and you shall be pardoned; Give, and gifts shall be given to you; Full measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over,  they shall pour into your bosom. For with what measure you measure,  they will measure back to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He also told them a parable. "Can a blind man lead a blind man? Will they not both fall into a pit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"There is no disciple who is above his master; But every one when he is completely trained will be like his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"And why do you look at the splinter that is in your brothers eye,  but never consider the beam that is in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"Or how can you say to your brother. "Brother, allow me to pull that splinter out of your eye," when you do not see the beam in your own eye? Hypocrite! Take out first the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the splinter from your brothers eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"For there is not good tree which bears worthless fruit, nor again any worthless tree which bears good fruit; for each tree is known by its own fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"You do not gather figs from thorns, and grapes are not plucked from a bramble-bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"The good man out of the good treasure-house of his heart brings forth good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure-house of his heart brings forth evil; for the mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"And why are you calling me Lord, Lord, and not doing what I tell you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"I will show whom the man that comes to me, and listens to my works,  and does them, is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"He is like a man who is building a house who digged and went deep and laid a foundation upon rock. And, when a flood came, the torrent dashed against that house, but could not move, because it had been founded upon rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"But he who listens but does not do, is like a man who built a house upon the soil, without foundations, against which the torrent burst,  and at once it fell in, and the ruin of that house was great."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
