"It is not possible but that occasions of stumbling should occur, but woe to him through whom they come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"It were well for him if a millstone were tied about his neck, and he were hurled into the sea, rather than he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Be on you guard! "If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"And if he sins against you seven times a day, and seven times a day turns to you saying I repent, you shall forgive him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The apostles said to the Lord, "Increase our faith!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"If your faith," answered Jesus, "were like a grain of mustard-seed,  you would say to this tree, Tear yourself up and be planted in the sea, and it would obey you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"But who of you who has a slave plowing or keeping sheep, will say to him, when he is come in from the field, Come at once, sit down to dinner,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"and will not rather tell him, Get ready something for me to eat,  and gird yourself to wait on me until I have eaten and drunken. Then you shall eat and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Does he think the slave because he did the things that were commanded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Even so, you also, after you have done all the things that are commanded you, should say, We are but slaves, we have only done what it was our duty to do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now it happened that as he went his way to Jerusalem, he passed between Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he was going certain village ten lepers met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They stood at a distance and lifted up their voices, saying, "Jesus,  Master, take pity on us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Perceiving this he said to them, "Go and show yourselves to the priest." And as they went they were made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now one of them, as he saw that he was cured, came back, glorifying God in a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he fell on his face at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Were there not ten cleansed?" asked Jesus, "but where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Are there none found to return and give glory to God except this foreigner?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said unto him, "Rise and go, your faith has healed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Pharisees asked him when the kingdom of God was coming. He answered. "The kingdom of God does not come so that you can catch sight of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"nor will they say, Look here it is! or See there! - for the kingdom of God is now in your midst."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he said turning to his disciples. "The days will come when you shall long to see one of the days of the Son of man, you shall not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"And they shall say to you, Lo there! Lo there! But do not go away or follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"For as the lightning when it lightens out of the one part under heaven shines to the other part under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected buy his generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"And this was in the time of Noah, so will it be in the time of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Men were eating and drinking; they were marrying and being married,  until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"The same was true in the time of Lot; they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"but on the day that Lot left Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"In the same manner it shall be in the day that the Son of man shall be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"On that day, if a man is on the housetop and his goods inside, let him not go down to take them away; nor should a man in the field turn back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"Remember Lots wife!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Whoever seeks to keep his life shall lose it; but whoever loses it shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"I tell you that in one night there shall be two men in one bed; one shall be taken and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken and the other left."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>(wanting in the most ancient manuscripts)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Where, Master?" they asked him. "Where the dead body is," he answered, "there will the vultures be gathered together."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
