"Take nothing for your journey, neither staff,  nor bag, nor bread, nor money, and do not have two tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Into whatever house you enter, there stay, and thence depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"If any one will not receive you, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave this town, as a testimony against them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they went forth, and walked from village to village, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Herod, the Tetrarch, heard of all that was happening; and he was perplexed because of its being said by someone that Johnwas risen from the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and by some that Elijah had appeared; and by others that one of the ancient prophets was risen again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Herod said, "I beheaded John, but who is this of whom I am hearing such reports," And he kept seeking to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>On their return the apostles told him what they had done. and he took them and withdrew in private to a town called Bethsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when the crowd learned this they followed him. He received them kindly and spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God, and healed those who needed restored to good health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But now the day began to decline, and the twelve came to him and said. "Send away the crowd so that they may go into the villages and surrounding the country to lodge and buy provisions; for here we are on a solitary place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Do you yourselves give them food," he answered. "We have nothing,"  they replied "Except five loaves, and a couple fish, unless you mean for us to go and buy provisions for all the crowd."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(For there were about five thousand men.) "Make them sit down in table-companies, of about fifty each," he said to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This they did, and made them all sit down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up in heaven, he blessed them, broke them in pieces, and began to giving to his disciples to apportion among the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they ate and were filled, all of them. And there was picked up that which remained over to them, of broken pieces, twelve basketfuls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now it happened that while he was praying by himself, the disciples were with him, and he asked them a question. "Who do the crowd think I am?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Johnthe Baptist," they answered, "But others say Elijah, and others that one of the ancient prophets is risen again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he said to them, "But who do you say I am? Then Peter answered saying, "The Christ of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he strictly forbade them to tell this to any one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and he said, "The Son of man must suffer much, and be restricted by the elders and high priests and scribes and be put to death, and on the third day be raised again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to all. "If any man wills to follow me, Let him renounce self and take up his cross daily and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"For whoever wills to save his life shall lose it; and whoever loses his life for my sake shall save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"For what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose or forfeit himself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my teachings, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in his own and in his Fathers glory, and in that of the holy angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"But I tell you truly there are some of those standing here who will not taste death till they see the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>About eight days after this it happened that Jesus took Peter,  James, and John, and went up on the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as he was praying the appearances of his countenance became different, and his clothing became white and dazzling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And suddenly there were two men talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>These appeared in glory and talked about his departure which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now Peter and those who were with him were heavy with sleep; but when they were fully awake they saw his glory, and the two men were standing beside him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they were preparing to depart from him Peter said to Jesus.  "Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents,  one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah" - not knowing what he was saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And while he was saying this, there came a cloud and began to overshadow them; and they were awestruck as they entered into the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying. "This is my Son, my chosen one; listen to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When the voice ceased Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no one at that time about what they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>It happened the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, that a large crowd came to meet him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and a man called out of the crowd saying. "Teacher, I beg you to look upon my son; for he is my only boy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"and behold a spirit seizes hold of him, and rudely he shouts out,  It convulses him till he foams; indeed it will hardly leave off bruising him sorely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"O faithless and perverse generation," said Jesus, "how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But while he was yet coming the demon dashed him down, and cruelly convulsed him. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and cured the boy, and gave him back to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they were all awestruck at the mighty power of God. But while everyone was marveling at what he was doing, he said to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Let these words sink into your ears; for the son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But they did not understand this saying; it was hidden from them so that they perceived it not, and they were sore afraid to ask him about his saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Now there arose a dispute among them as to which one of them was the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Jesus who knew the dispute that was in their hearts, took a young child, and placed him by his side;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>then he said to them. "Whoever shall receive this little child in my name receives me; and whoever shall receive me receives him that sent me. For it is the lowliest among you all who is great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"Master," said John, "we saw a man who was casting out demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he was not following us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus said, "Forbid him not, for he who is not against you is for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>When now when the time drew near for him to be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and sent messengers before him. These went and entered into a Samaritan village to make ready for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But they did not receive him because his face was set to go to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when his disciples, Jamesand John, saw this they said, "Lord,  are you willing for us to bid fire come down from heaven and destroy them?" As Elijah did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he turned and rebuked them and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>"You know not what kind of spirit you share, for the Son of man came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them." And they went to another village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As they were going on their way, a man came to him and said, "I will follow wherever you go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>"The foxes have their holes," Jesus answered, "and the wild birds have their nest, but the Son of man has not where to lay his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>To another he said, "Follow me!" But he replied, "Permit me first to go and bury my father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>"Leave the dead to bury their own dead," said Jesus to him, "go you and announce, far and wide the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And another man also said to him. "I will follow you, Lord; but first permit me to bid farewell to those who are in my house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>But Jesus answered him, "No man who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back, is fit for the kingdom of God."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
