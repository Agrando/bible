"There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and this steward was accused to him of wasting his property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"He called to him to him and said. "What is this that I hear about you? Render an account of your stewardship; for you can no longer be steward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Now the steward said to himself. What shall I do, now that my master is taking away my stewardship? I am not strong enough to dig,  to beg I am ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"I know what I will do, so that when I am put out of my stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"So he called to him each of his masters debtors and said to the first, How much money do you owe my master?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"A hundred measures of oil, he answered. "He said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"To a second he said, How much do you owe? "The man answered, A hundred measures of wheat. "Here is you bill, he said, change it to eighty measures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And the master praised the unjust steward because he had acted shrewdly; for the sons of this world are in relation to their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"And to you I say, Use mammon, dishonest as it is, to make yourselves friends, so that when it shall fail they will welcome you to the eternal tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"The man who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much,  and he who is unjust in a very little, is unjust also as much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"If therefore you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon,  who will trust to you the true riches?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"And if you are not faithful with what belongs to another, who will give you what is your own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"No one can be a household servants to two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will cling to the one and despise the other. You cannot be the slave of God and of Mammon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the Pharisees who loved money listened to all this and they jeered at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them. "You are those that justify themselves in the eyes of men; but God knows you hearts; for that which is lofty in the eyes of men is abomination in the eyes of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"The Law and the Prophet lasted until John; since then the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and any one presses in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Yet it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away then for one title of the law to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Every man who divorces his wife and marries some one else, commits adultery; and he who marries one who is put away by her husband commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Now there was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and made merry every day in splendor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"And a certain beggar named Lazarus was thrown at his door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"He was full of sores, and longingly desired to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich mans table. Yes! even the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"But in the course of time the beggar died; and he was carried by angels into Abrahams bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"The rich man also died, and was buried. And as he was tormented in Hades, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"And he cried out and said, Father Abraham have mercy on me; and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Remember my son. said Abraham, that you had in your lifetime all your good things, and in the same way Lazarus his evil things; but now here he is comforted, and you are in anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"But besides all this, between us and you there is a great chasm fixed, so that those who want to cross from here to you cannot, nor can those who would cross from you to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"I beg you then, father, he said, send him to my fathers house.  For I have five brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Let him earnestly warn them, lest they too come to this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"But Abraham said, They have Moses and the Prophets, let them listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"Nay, Father Abraham, he said but if some one went to them from the dead they would repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets, said Father Abraham, neither will they be persuaded if one should rise from the dead."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
