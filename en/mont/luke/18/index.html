Nevertheless, when the Son of man comes, will he find faith upon the earth?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moreover he spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves because they were righteous, and looked down upon the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Two men are going up to the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, the other a tax-gatherer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"The Pharisee stood apart and thus began to pray by himself. "O God, I thank thee that I am not like the rest of men, extortioners,  rogues, adulterers, or even like this tax gatherer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"I fast twice a week, I pay tithes of all my possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"But the tax-gatherer, standing far back, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but kept beating his breast and saying, "O God be merciful to me, the sinner!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"I tell you that this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for every one who exalts himself shall be humbled;  but he who humbles himself shall be exalted."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they kept bringing their babies for him to touch them; but when his disciples saw it they began to rebuke them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus called for the babies. "Let the little children come to me," he said, "do not hinder them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"I tell you in solemn truth that whoever will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child, he will never get into it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A ruler put this question to him. "Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Why are you calling me good?"said Jesus to him; "no one is good but God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"You know the commandments. "Do not commit adultery, Do not murder,  Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"All of these," he replied, "I have kept from my youth up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And receiving this reply, Jesus said to him. "One thing you are still lacking. Sell all that you have and give it to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he heard these words he became deeply grieved, for he was exceedingly rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus looked at him and said. "How hard it is for those who have money to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Why, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Who then can be saved?" exclaimed his hearers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Things that are impossible with men," he answered them, "are possible with God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter said, "Look! we have left our homes and followed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, "In Solemn truth I tell you that there is no one who, for the sake of the kingdom of God, has left houses, or wife, or brother, or parents, or children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"who shall not certainly receive many times as much in this time,  and in the age to come eternal."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he took the twelve aside and told them. "See, we are on our way to Jerusalem, and all prophets regarding the son of Man will be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"He will be betrayed to the Gentiles, and be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"and they will scourge and kill him; and the third day he will rise again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they understood none of these sayings. His words were a mystery to them, and they did not know what he meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As Jesus drew near to Jericho, there was a blind man who sat by the wayside begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He heard the crowd passing and asked what the matter was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They told him, "Jesus of Nazareth is passing by."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he shouted out, saying, "Jesus, son of David, take pity on me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Those who went ahead began to reprove him and to tell him to be still; but he kept clamorously shouting all the more, "Son of David,  take pity on me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Jesus stopped and ordered him to be brought to him. When he was come near to him he asked him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord," he answered, "that I might see again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"Receive your sight," said Jesus, "your faith has saved you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Instantly he regained his sight and followed Jesus, giving glory to God; and all the people who saw it gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
