The voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare the way for God, make straight paths for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Every ravine shall be filled up, Every hill and mountain shall be laid low, The crooked shall be made straight, And the rough roads smooth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Johnused to say to the crowd of those who were going out to be baptized by him. "You breed of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then bring forth fruit befitting your penitence, and do not begin to say to yourselves, "We have Abraham as our father." I tell you that God is able to raise up sons to Abraham out of these stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now truly the axe is already laid at the root of the trees. So every tree which is not bearing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the crowd began to ask him questions. "What shall we do then?"  they asked. In reply he said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"If you have two shirts share with him who has none; and let him who has food do the same."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There came to him publicans also to be baptized, and they said to him, "Master, what must we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, "Exact no more than the sum allowed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The soldiers also repeatedly questioned him, saying, "And we, what shall we do?" "Do not intimidate any one," he replied, "nor lay false charges, and be content with your pay."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And while the people were in expectation, and all men were debating in their hearts about John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>whether perhaps he were the Christ, Johnanswered, saying to all of them. "I indeed am baptizing you in water, but One is coming after me, mightier than I, whose shoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloose.  He shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and in fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He has his fan in his hand to cleanse his threshing-floor thoroughly, and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff will he burn with unquenchable fire."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>With many other exhortations then Johndeclared the gospel to the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but Herod, the Tetrarch, when reproved by him because of Herodias,  his brothers wife, and because of all the wicked deeds that he had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>added yet this above them all that he shut up Johnin prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now after all the people had been baptized, and Jesus himself had been baptized and was praying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>heaven opened, and the Holy Spirit, in bodily form like a dove,  descended upon him. and a voice came out of heaven, saying. "Thou art my Son, dearly beloved; in thee is my delight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus himself when he began to teach was about thirty years of age. He was the son (as it was supposed) of Joseph, the son of Heli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>son of Matthias, son of Nahum, son of Esli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>son of Mahath, son of Matthias, son of Semein, son of Joseph, son of Joda,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>son of Johann, son of Resa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam, son of Er,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>son of Joshua, son of Eliezar, son of Jorim, son of Mathat, son of Levi,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>son of Symeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonan, son of Eliakim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>son of Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Salmon, son of Nahshon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>son of Amminadab, son of Admin, son of Arni, son of Hezron, son of Perez, son of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Shelah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>son of Cainan, son of Arpachshad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalel, son of Kenan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
