Mary of Magdala, out of whom seven demons have been driven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, and Susanna, and many other women, who used to minister to him out of their substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As a great crowd was gathering, and men of town after town kept restoring to him, he spoke a parable to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he sowed some fell by the wayside, and was trodden under foot, and the wild birds ate it up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Some other seed dropped on the rock, as soon as it grew it withered away, because it had no moisture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Another part fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew with it and choked it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"But some fell on good soil, and grew up, and brought forth fruit, a hundredfold." When he said this, he called out, "Whoever has ears to hear with, let him listen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then his disciples began to interrupt him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He answered. "To you it is given to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of God; But all others are taught in parables so that seeing they shall not see, and hearing they shall not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Those by the wayside are people who hear, but then comes the devil and carries off the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and not be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Those on the rock are people who, upon hearing, receive the word with joy; but they have no root. For a time indeed they all believe,  but in time of temptation they fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"And that which fell upon thorns is those who have heard, but as they go on their way of word is choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of life; so they bring no fruit of perfection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"And that in the good soil is those who have listened to the message and, in an honest and good heart, hold fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"When he lights a lamp no one covers it with a vase or hides it under a bed; he puts it on a lamp-stand so whoever may behold the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"For is nothing hidden that shall not be disclosed; there is nothing secret which shall not be made known and come to the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Take heed, then, how you listen. for he who has, to him shall it be given, but from him who has not, shall be taken away even what he has."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There came to him his mother and his brothers, and they could not reach him because of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But some one told him, "Your mother and brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"My mother and brothers," he answered, "are those who listen to the word of God and obey it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now it happened that one of these days he got into a boat, And him his disciples, and he said to them, "Let us cross to the other side of the lake."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they set sail. While they were sailing he fell asleep. And there fell on the lake a squall of wind, so that the boat began to fill,  and they to be in deadly peril.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then they came to him and woke him, saying, "Master, Master, we are lost!" Then he awoke, and rebuked the winds and the raging of the sea. They ceased, and there was a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Where is your faith?" he asked them, In their terror they were filled with amazement, and said to one another, "Who is this who commands even the winds and the sea, and they obey him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they put in at the country of Gadarenes, which is across from Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he landed here he was met by a certain townsman who was possessed by demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes and nor lived in any house, but in tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he saw Jesus he cried out, and fell down before him, and in a loud voice exclaimed. "What have we to do with you, Jesus, you son of God Most High? I implore you to torment me not!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For Jesus was already commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For many times it had seized him and held him, and they again and again kept him under guard, and put him in chains and fetters. But he would break his bonds asunder, as he was driven by the demon in to the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" And he answered, "Legion"  (for many demons had entered into him).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So they besought Jesus not to command them to go away into the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now there was a great herd of swine feeding on the hillside, and the demons begged him to give them leave to enter them. He gave them leave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The demons came out of the man, and entered into the swine; the herd rushed violently down over the cliff into the lake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And those who saw what had happened fled and reported it in the town and the villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then the people came out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man out of whom the demons had gone sitting clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus. And they were terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the whole populace of Gadarenes and the surrounding territory besought Jesus to go away from them; for they were terror-stricken.  So he entered a boat and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the man out of whom the demons had gone kept begging him that he might be with him. But Jesus sent him away saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"Return to your home, and tell them all that God has done for you."  So he went away and throughout the whole city he published how much Jesus had done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And as Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>for they were all waiting for him. Just then there came a man named Jarius, and he was ruler in the synagogue. He fell down at Jesus  feet and begged him to come into his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for he had only one daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went the crowds continued to press in on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And a woman who for twelve years had had a hemorrhage, and had spent on doctors all that she had, but none had cured her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>came close behind him, and touched the hem of his garment; and instantly the hemorrhage ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"Who is that touched me?" said Jesus and when everybody denied it,  Peter said, "Master, the crowds are hemming you in and pressing upon you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But Jesus said. "Some one did touch me; for I perceived that the power was proceeding out of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the woman, who saw that she had not escaped notice, came trembling, and falling down before him, stated before the people for what reason she had touched him, and how she had been instantly healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"Daughter," he said "your faith has made you well, go on into peace."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>As he was speaking some one came from the house of the synagogue,  saying. "Your daughter is dead! Do not trouble the Master."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus heard and answered. "Have no fear. Only believe, and she shall be restored."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>So he came to the house, and would not permit anyone to go in with him except Peter and Johnand James, and the father and Mother of the little girl.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The people were weeping and bewailing her, but he said. "Stop your wailing; for she is not dead, but asleep."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They began to laugh him to scorn, because they knew well that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But he took her by the hand and called to her, "Little daughter,  rise!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her spirit returned and instantly she stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He bade them to get her some food. Her parents were amazed; but he forbade them to tell any one what had been done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
