If she loses one, does she not light a lamp and sweep the house, and search anxiously until she finds it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"And when she has found it, she calls together her woman friends and neighbors and say, Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I had lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Even so I tell you there is joy in the presence of the angels for God over one sinner who repents."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said. "There was a man who had two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"The younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the share of your property which is coming to me. So he divided his means among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Not many days after that the younger son gathered everything together and took his journey into a distant country; and there he wasted his money on living unsavingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"After he had spent everything there came a terrible famine in the land, and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"So he went and hired to one of the citizens of that land, who sent him out into the fields to feed swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"And he was longing to be filled with the husks which the swine were eating, but no one gave him any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"When he came to himself he said. "How many of my fathers hired men have bread enough and to spare, while I am perishing of hunger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"I will rise and go to my father, and say to him. "Father, I have sinned against Heaven and in your sight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>""I am no more worthy to be called your son; only make me like one of your hired men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"So he arose and went to his father; but while he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"The son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight and am no more worthy to be called your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Fetch the best robe, quick, said the father to his slaves, and put it on him, and give him a ring on his finger, and shoes on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Bring that fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"for this son of mine was dead and is alive again - he was lost and is found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"So they began to make merry. But his elder son was in the field,  and as he drew near to the house he heard music and dancing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"and he summoned one of the slaves, and began to inquire of him what all this meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Your brother is come, he replied, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has him safe and sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"But he was angry and would not go in; so his father came out, and attempted to plead with him; but he said to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"All these years I have been slaving for you and never disobeyed a command of yours. Yet you never gave me even a kid so that I might make merry with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your property with harlots, you have killed him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"My dear son, answered his father, you are always with me and all that is mine is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"But it was fitting that we should make merry and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and is alive; he was lost and is found."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
