"If you really are the Son of God throw yourself down here;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for it is written, "He shall give his angels charge of thee, to guard thee safely;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"They will bear thee up in their hands, Lest thou dash thy food against a stone."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"It has been said," replied Jesus, "Thou shalt not tempt the Lord,  thy God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So, after exhausting on him every kind of temptation, the devil left him for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and his fame spread throughout all the surrounding country,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he began to teach in their synagogues, and was glorified by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. and, as was his custom, he entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath Day, and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there was handed him the roll of the prophet Isaiah; and unrolling it he found the place where it was written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me Because He has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, He has sent me to proclaim release to the prisoners, And recovery of sight to the blind; To set at liberty those that are bruised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then rolling up the papyrus, he gave it back to the attendant and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him, and he began to say to them, "Today is this scripture fulfilled in your hearing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they all spoke well of him, and marveled at the words of charm that fell from his lips. "Is not this the son of Joseph?" they asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered. "Doubtless you will quote the proverb to me,  "Physician, heal thyself! Do also here in your own country all that we hear that you have done in Capernaum."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"I tell you in solemn truth," he added, "that no prophet is acceptable in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In very truth I tell you there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heavens were closed for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"yet Elijah was not sent to any one of them, but only to a widow in Zarephath in Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"And there were many lepers in Israel in the days of the prophet Elisha, yet none of them was cleansed but only Naaman the Syrian."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When they had heard these words, those in the synagogue were filled with fury;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>they rose, hurried him outside the town, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, intending to cast him down headlong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he, passing through the midst of them, took his departure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and continued to teach the people on the Sabbath Days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They were deeply impressed by his teaching because his speech was with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there was in the synagogue a man possessed by the spirit of a foul demon. He cried out, in a loud voice, saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Ha! Jesus of Nazareth, what business have you with us? Are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, you holy one of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying. "Be quiet! Come out of him." And when the demon had thrown the man down before them, he came out of him without doing him any harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>All were amazed, and began to ask one another, saying. "What is this word? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the talk about him spread into every locality in the surrounding country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now when he rose and left the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon, where Simons mother-in-law lay sick of a great fever. And they kept entreating him for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her; and at once she arose and ministered unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>At sunset all they who had any sick with any sort of disease brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Demons also came out of many, screaming and saying, "You are the Son of God." But he rebuked them, and did not permit them to speak,  because they knew that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when it was daybreak he left the town, and went away to a solitary place; and the crowd kept seeking him. Coming at length upon him, they attempted to detain him so that he should not leave them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But he said to them. "I must preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to the other towns also; for that is what I was sent to do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
