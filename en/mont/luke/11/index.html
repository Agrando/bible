"When you pray, say, "Father, hallowed be thy name; May thy kingdom come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Give us day by day our bread for the coming day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Forgive us our sins; for we also forgive everyone who has offended us; "And bring us not into temptation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He also said to them. "Suppose you have a friend and you go to him,  My friend, lend me three loaves of bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"for a friend of mine is come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"and he from indoors shall answer. Do not pester me. The door is now closed, and my children are with me in bed. I cannot rise and give to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"I tell you that, though he will not rise and give to him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunate persistence he will rise and give him whatever he needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"So I say to you. "Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"For he that asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks the door shall be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"What father is there among you who, if his son asks for a loaf,  will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish will give him instead a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Or if he asks for an egg, will offer him a scorpion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"If you give good gifts to your children, how much more shall the Father who is in heaven give the Holy spirit to those that ask him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Once he was casting out a dumb demon, and when the demon was gone out, the dumb man spoke, and the people wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some of them said, "It is by Beelzebub, the prince of demons,  that he cast out demons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Others, tempting him, kept seeking from him a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He knew their intentions and said to them. "Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste and house falls upon house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And if Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Do you say that I am casting out demons by the power of Beelzebub?  If I then am casting out demons by Beelzebub, by whom are your sons casting them out? They therefore shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"But if it is by the finger of God that I am casting out demons,  then the kingdom of God is come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"When the strong man fully aroused keeps guard over his homestead,  his property is undisturbed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"but when the stronger man attacks him, he takes away from the strong armor in which he was trusting and divides up the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"He who is not for me is against me, and he who is not gathering with me is scattering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Whenever a foul spirit is gone out of a man, it roams through waterless places, in search of rest; but when it can find none, it says, I will go back to the house which I have left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When it comes and finds the house completely swept and garnished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Then it goes off and fetches seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the last state of that man is worse than the first."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It happened while he was saying this, that a certain woman out of the crowd shouted to him, saying, "Blessed is the womb that bore you,  and the breast that you have sucked."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"No, rather," he answered, "blessed are those who listen to the word of God, and keep it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When the crowd were beginning to throng about him he proceeded to say. "This is an evil generation! It seeks a sign, and there shall be no sign be given to it except the sign of Jonah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"for as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so shall the Son of man be to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"The queen of the South shall rise up in Judgement with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them; because she came from the ends of the earth to listen to the wisdom of Solomon, and lo, one greater than Solomon is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"The men of the Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with his generation and shall condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and lo! one greater than Jonah is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"When one lights a lamp he does not put it in a cellar nor under the bushel, but on a lamp-stand that those who enter may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"The lamp of the body is your eye; when your eye is single then your whole body is full of light; but when it is evil your whole body is full of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Look carefully! Perhaps that very light of yours is darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"If, however, your whole body is full of light, without having any part dark, it will be wholly radiant with light, as when the lamp illumines you with its bright rays."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When he had finished speaking a Pharisee asked him to dine with him;  so he went in with him and reclined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the Pharisee noticed, to his amazement, that he did not wash his hands before eating,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but the Lord said to him. "You Pharisee do cleanse the outside of your cup or plate, but your secret heart is full of extortion and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"Foolish men! Did not He who made the outside make the inside also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"Better cleanse what is within, and nothing will be unclean for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"But woe unto you Pharisee! for you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and disregard justice and the love of God; but these you ought to have done, and not leave the other undone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"Woe unto you Pharisee! for you delight in the best seats in the synagogue, and in the salutation in the market-places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Woe unto you! for you are like the tombs which are hidden, and men walk over them unsuspecting."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Hereupon one of the lawyers exclaimed, "But teacher, in saying such things you are also reproaching us also."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"Woe unto you lawyers also!" said Jesus, "for you load men with irksome burdens, and you yourselves will not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Woe to you! for you are building the tombs of the prophets whom you ancestors killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"So you are witnesses, and you consent to the actions of your ancestors. for they killed them, and you build their tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"For this reason also said the Wisdom of God. I will send them prophets and apostles; some of them they will kill and some they will persecute;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>"so that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required from this generation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the alter and the sanctuary; yes; I tell you, it shall be required of this generation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>"Woe to you lawyers, for you have taken away the key of knowledge!  You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who are trying to enter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>After he had gone away, the Scribes and the Pharisee began to set themselves vehemently against him, and to cross-question him upon many points,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>laying in wait for him, in order to catch a word from his lips.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
