"A certain nobleman went abroad to receive for himself royal power and to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"And he summoned ten slaves of his, and gave them ten pounds, and said to them, "Trade with these until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"But this fellow citizens hated him, and sent a deputation after him to say, We do not wish this man to become our king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"And upon his return after he had secured the royal power, he ordered the slaves to whom he had given the money to be called in, so that he might know what they had gained by trading.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"And the first came before him, saying, Master, your pound has made ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"And he said to him, Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And the second came and said, Master, your pound has made five pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Then he said to him also, You shall be over five cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"And the next came to him and said, Here master is your pound which I was keeping safe in a napkin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"For I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take what you did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"He said to him, "By your own words I will Judge you, you wicked slave. You knew, did you, that I was a hard man taking up what I did not lay down, reaping what I did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Then why did you not put my money into the bank, so that at my coming I might I might have gotten it back with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Then to those who stood by, he said, Take the pounds from him and give it to him who has ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Master, they said to him, he already has ten pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"I tell you that to every one who has it shall be given; and from him who has not shall be taken away even what he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Howbeit these enemies of mine who were not willing for me to become their King, bring them here, and slay them in my presence."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he had so spoken he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he was come near Bethphage and Bethany at the mount called The Olive Orchard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>he sent two of his disciples saying. "Go into the village in the front, and on entering it you will find an asss colt tied, on which no one has ever ridden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Untie it and bring it here. And if any one asks you, Why are you untying the colt? Simply say, The Master needs it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then those who were sent out and found it as he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For as they were untying the colt, the owners said to them, "Why are you untying the colt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered, "The Master needs it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they led it to Jesus, and, after throwing their outer garments on the colt, they placed Jesus on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So he rode on, while they kept throwing their garments in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when now he was coming near Jerusalem, and descending the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice, and to praise God with a loud voice for the almighty works they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They cried, "Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the Lord!  Peace in Heaven and glory in the Highest"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees said to them out of the crowd, "Teacher reprove your disciples!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"I tell you," he answered, "that if these should hold their peace,  the very stones would cry out."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he came into view of the city, as he approached it he broke into loud weeping,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>exclaiming. "Oh that at this time you knew, yes, even you, on what your peace depends! But now it is hidden from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"The time will come for you when your enemies will throw ramparts around you, and encompass you, and shut you in on every side, and raze you to the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"you and your children within you. And they will not leave in you one stone upon the another. Because you knew not the time of your visitation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then Jesus went into the Temple and began to drive out dealers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying, "It is written, "The house of God shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Day after day he continued to teach in the Temple. The high priests and scribes tried to have him put to death, so did the rulers of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But they could not find how to do it, for the people all hung upon him, listening to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
