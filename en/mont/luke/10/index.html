"The harvest is abundant, but the harvesters are few. do you therefore pray the lord of the harvest to send forth harvesters into his harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Go your way; behold, I am sending you forth like lambs among wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Carry no purse, no bag, no shoes; and do not salute any one on your journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Into whatever you first enter, say, Peace be to this house!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"And if there be any son of peace there, your peace shall rest upon him; but if not it shall return to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Stay in that same house, eating and drinking what they give. for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Do not go from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And whatever town you come to, and they receive you, eat whatever they put before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Heal the sick in that town and tell them, The kingdom of God draws near to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"But whatever town you enter, and they do not receive you, Go out into the streets and cry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"The very dust of your town which clings to your feet we wipe off as protest; but know this, that the kingdom of God is drawing near to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"For I tell you that it will be mare tolerable for Sodom in that day than for that town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Woe unto you, Chorazin! Woe unto you, Bethsaida! For had the mighty been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"However, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"And you Capernaum, shall you be exalted to heaven? No! you shall be brought down to Hades!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"He who listens to you listens to me. and he who rejects you,  rejects me; he who rejects me, rejects him who sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the Seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord even the demons are subject to us in your name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to them. "I watched Satan fall from heaven like a lightning flash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Behold, I give you the power to tread upon serpents and scorpions,  and to trample on all the power of the enemy. In no case shall anything do you harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Nevertheless, do not rejoice at this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in Heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the same hour he thrilled with joy in the Holy Ghost. "I praise thee, Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth," he said "for hiding these things from the wise and prudent, and for revealing them to babes.  Yea, Father, for so it was well pleasing in thy sight!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"All things have been delivered to me by my Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father; and who the Father is except the Son, and he the Son wishes to reveal him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And turning to his disciples he said privately. "Blessed are the eyes that see what you see!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"For I tell you that many prophets and kings have longed to see what you see, and have seen it; and to hear what you hear, and have heard it not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him. "Master," he said "what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to him. "What is written in the Law? What do you read there?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"You must love the Lord your God," he answered, with all your heart,  and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your with all your mind; and your neighbor as yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"You have answered right," said Jesus "do that and you shall live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, determined to justify himself, said to Jesus, "But who is my neighbor?" Jesus answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he fell among bandits who both stripped him and beat him, and went off leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Now a certain priest chanced to be going down that way, but on seeing him he passed on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"In like manner also a Levite who came to the spot, came and looked at him, and passed on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was, and when he saw him was moved with compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"He went to him bound up his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine.  He set him on his own beast, and took him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"The next day he took two silver pieces and gave them to the landlord and said, "Take care of him, and whatever more you spend I will repay it to you on my way back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Which then of these three seems to you to have behaved like a neighbor to the man who fell among bandits?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He replied, "The one who showed mercy on him." "Go, then," said Jesus, "and do likewise."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>It happened as they went on their way that he entered into a certain village were a woman named Martha received him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>She had a sister named Mary, who after seating herself at the Lords feet was listening to his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha meanwhile was growing distracted about much serving. She came up to him and said. "Lord do you not care that my sister has left me alone to do the serving? Come tell her to take hold of her end of the work along with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"Martha, Martha," said Jesus, "you are anxious and worried about many things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"only one thing is really necessary. Mary, moreover, has chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
