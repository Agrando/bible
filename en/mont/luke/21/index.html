"Of truth I tell you that this poor widow has put in more than than they all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"for these men have all contributed to the offering out of their surplus, but she, out of her want, contributed all she had to live on."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And to some who were about the Temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones votive offerings, he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"As for what you are looking at, the time is coming when not one stone will be left upon another, that shall not be thrown down."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Teacher, when will this be?" they asked him, "and what shall be the sign that these things are about to happen?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Take heed," he answered, "that you are not led astray, for many will come in my name, saying, I am he, and The time is close at hand. Do not go and follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"And when you shall hear of wars and tumults, do not be frightened;  for these things must happen first, but the end does not come immediately."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to them. "Nation shall rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"and there shall be great earthquakes, and, in many places, famines and pestilences; and there shall be terror and great portents from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"But before all these things happen, they will apprehend you and persecute you and deliver you to the synagogues and to prisons, and bring you before kings and governors for the sake of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"It shall turn out for a testimony to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"So settle it in your hearts not to prepare a defense beforehand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"for I will give you utterance and a wisdom which none of your adversaries will be able to answer or withstand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"You will be betrayed even by parents or brothers and kinsfolk, and friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Some of you they will put to death. And you shall be hated by all men for the sake of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"And not a hair on your head shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"In your patience you shall purchase your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"But when you see Jerusalem encompassed with armies, then know that her desolation is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let those who are in the country enter not in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"For these are the days of vengeance and of fulfilment of all that is written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Woe to women with child and to those who are nursing infants in those days! For sore anguish will come upon the land, and wrath upon all his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive among the Gentiles, and Jerusalem shall be trampled under foot by the Gentiles, until the appointed times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"And there will be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars; and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity at the roar of the sea and the billows;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"men lifeless through fear, and foreboding of that which is about to come upon the habitable earth. For the powers of the heavens shall be shaken,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"and then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud, with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, lift your heads! for your redemption is drawing near."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he told them a parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"Look at the fig tree and all the trees! When they put out their leaves you can see for yourselves that summer is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"So whenever you see all these things comings to pass, you know that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"In solemn truth I tell you that this generation shall not pass away until all this happens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words shall never pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"But take heed to yourselves lest your hearts be surcharged with self-indulgence and drunkenness and worldly cares, and that day catches you suddenly like a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"For it will come upon all the dwellers on the face of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"So be on your guard at all times, praying that you may be worthy to escape these things that shall come to pass, and to take your stand in the presence of the Son of man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And each day he was habitually in the Temple teaching, and at night he used to go out and lodge on the mount called the Olives Orchards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And all the people used to come him early in the morning in the Temple, to listen to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
