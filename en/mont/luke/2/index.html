The angel said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Have no fear, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,  which shall be for all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"For unto you born this day in there is born in Davids town a Saviour, who is the Anointed Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"And this is a sign to you; You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling-clothes lying in a manger."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the Heavenly army praising God and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Glory to God in the highest, And in earth peace among men who please him"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when the angels had left them, and gone away to heaven, the shepherds said to one to another, "Let us go now even to Bethlehem,  and see this saying which has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so they made haste, and came and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they had seen, they made known about the words which had been spoken to them concerning the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all who heard it were astonished at the things which were told to them by the shepherds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Mary treasured up all those words, Often pondering on on them in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the shepherds returned, glorifying God and praising him for all those things that they had seen and heard, even as it was told to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When eight days had passed, and the time had come to circumcise him,  he was called Jesus, the name given him by the angel before his conception in the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the days for purification according to the law of Moses had passed, they took him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>as it is written in the law of Moses, Every firstborn male shall be called holy to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord A pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there was in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon. He was righteous and devout, and was waiting for the consolation of Israel.  The Holy Spirit was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now it has been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lords Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came into the Temple, led by the Spirit. and when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Now lettest thou thy slave depart, O Master; according to thy word in peace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"Because my eyes had seen the salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"A light for the unveiling of the Gentiles And the glory of thy people Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while his father and mother were marveling at the words that were spoken concerning him, Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Behold this child is set for the falling and rising up of many in Israel, and for a sign which is spoken against.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yea, and a sword shall pierce through your own soul also, that the thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>There was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in age, having lived with her husband seven years, after her girlhood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and then being a widow even for fourscore and four years. She departed not from the temple, but worshiped with the fasting and prayer, night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>She came up at that very hour, and gave thanks to God, and spoke of the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>As soon as all that the law required had been done, they returned to Galilee to their own town, Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the child grew and became strong, becoming full of wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now his parents were accustomed to go up to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when he was twelve years old they went up, as was customary, at the time of the feast</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>After spending the full number of days they started home, but the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. Joseph and his mother did not know this,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but supposed that he was in the company, and went a days journey.  Then they hunted for him among his kinsfolk and acquaintance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and when they did not find him they returned to Jerusalem, making anxious inquiry for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>On the third day they found him sitting in the Temple, among the Rabbis, both listening to them and asking questions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>When they saw him they were astonished, and his mother said to him "Child, why have you treated us so? Behold your father and I have been looking for you in anguish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He answered, "Why is it that you have been looking for me, did you not realize that I had to be in my Fathers house?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But they did not understand the words that he spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and he was always obedient to them. But his mother kept treasuring up all these incidents in her hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus was ever advancing in wisdom and in status and in favor with God and man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
