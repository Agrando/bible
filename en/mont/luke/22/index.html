"No sooner will you have entered the city than you will meet a man carrying a water-jug. Follow him into the house were he is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"And to the good man of the house say, The teacher asks you, "Where is the room in which I can eat the Passover with my disciples?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Then he will show you a large upper room furnished. There make your preparations."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they went and found everything as he had told them, they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the hour was come he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he said to them. "With desire have I longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I tell you that I certainly will not eat again until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he had received a cup and given thanks, he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Take this, and divide it among yourselves; for I tell you that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God is come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he took a loaf, and after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them saying. "This is my body, which is given for you; this do in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He gave them a cup in like manner, after supper saying. "This cup is the new covenant in my blood, poured out for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"But behold, the hand of my betrayer is at the table with me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"The Son of man indeed goes on his way, as it has been determined;  but woe to that man by who he is betrayed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they began to question among themselves which of them it could be who was going to do such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there arose also a dispute among them as to which of them could be considered the greatest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he said to them. "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them,  and those who have who have authority over them are called Benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"But you shall not be so. But he who is greater among you let him become like the younger; and he who is leader like him who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"For which is greater, he who sits at table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at table? But I am in your midst as one who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"You, however, are those who have stood by me in my trials.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"And I promise you a kingdom, even as my Father has promised me a kingdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"so that you shall eat and drink in my kingdom, and you shall sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Simon, Simon," said the Lord, "behold, Satan has asked to have you all that he might sift you like wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"But I made supplication for you that your own faith may not fail.  And you, when you have turned again, must strengthen your brothers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Lord," Simon said to him, "I am ready to go with you, both to prison and to death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"I tell you, Peter," he answered. "the cock will not crow this day until you will three times deny that you know me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Moreover, he said to them, "When I sent you out without purse or wallet or sandals, did you lack anything?" They answered him, "We lacked nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then he said to them. "But now let him who has a purse take it, and he who has a wallet, let him the do the same. And he who has no sword, let him sell his cloak and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"For I say to you that this word of Scripture must find its fulfilment in me. "And he was numbered among the transgressors, For that which concerns me has its accomplishment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"Master" they said, "here are two swords!" "That is enough," he answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he went out, and began to go to the Mount of Olives, as was his wont; and his disciples followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But he arrived at the place he said to them, "Pray that you enter not into temptation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But he himself withdrew from them about a stones throw, kneeling down he prayed repeatedly, saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"Father, if thou art willing, take away this cup from me; but thy will, not mine, be done!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>(And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>(And being in agony he kept praying more earnestly; and his sweat became as if it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When he arose from his prayers, and came to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and said to them. "Why are you asleep? Get up, and pray that you enter not into temptation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he was still speaking there came a crowd, and he who was called Judas, one of the Twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus in order to kiss him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>but Jesus said to him, "Judas, you are betraying the Son of man with a kiss?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Those who were around him, when they saw what was about to happen,  said to him, "Lord, shall we strike with our swords?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then one of them did strike a blow at the high priests slave, and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"Permit me to do this at least," said Jesus, as he touched his ear and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to the corps of priests and captains of the temple and elders who had come out to arrest him. "Have ye come for me with swords and clubs to arrest me like a robber?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>"When daily I was with you in the temple you did not stretch out your hands to take me; but this is your hour and the power of darkness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So they seized him and led him away, and took him to the house of the high priest; while Peter was following him a long way off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had lighted a fire in the center of the court, and had sat down together, Peter was taking his seat among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But a certain maid servant saw him taking his seat near the fire and, with a sharp glance at him, she said, "This fellow was with him,  too!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied it, saying, "Woman, I know nothing about him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>A little later a man saw him, and said, "You too are one of them"  But Peter declared, "Man, I am not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>But an hour afterwards another man kept insisting, saying. "Really, this fellow was with him. Why, he is a Galilean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>"Man," said Peter, "I do not know what you mean." And immediately,  while he was still speaking, the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter, and Peter recollected the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, "This very day, before the cock crows, you will deny me three times."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Peter went outside and wept with bitter crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Meanwhile the men who were holding Jesus in custody kept mocking and striking him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>They would blindfold him and ask him. "Prophesy! Tell who struck you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And they said many other insulting things against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>When it became the day the elders if the people met with the high priests and the Scribes and had brought before the Sanhedrin, saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>"Are you the Christ? Tell us!" "If I tell you," he answered, "you will not believe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>"And if I ask you, you will not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>"But from henceforth the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then they all said, "Are you then the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>"What need we of further evidence? for we ourselves have heard it from his own lips."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
