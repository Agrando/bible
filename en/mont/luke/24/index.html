"Why are you seeking him who lives among the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"He is not here; he is risen. Do you remember how he told you when he was still in Galilee</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>that the Son of man had to be betrayed into the hands of sinful men,  and to be crucified, and to rise on the third day?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then they recollected his words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and turning away from the tomb they told all this to the eleven, and to all the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, and Mary, the mother of James, and the rest of the women who were telling all this to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the whole story seemed to them but an idle tale; and they disbelieved the women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb, but when he stooped and looked in he saw the linen wrappings by themselves, and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On that same day two of his disciples were walking to Emmaus, a village about seven miles from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They were talking together about all these events,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and as they talked and discussed matter, Jesus himself drew near and began walking beside them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But their eyes continued to be held that they should not recognize him even for an instant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, "What words are these that you are exchanging one with another, as you walk along?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They stood still, looking sad. And one of them named Cleopas,  answered him, "Do you sojourn alone in Jerusalem, that you do not know what things have been happening there these days?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"What kind of things?" he answered. And they said. "The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"and how our high priest and ruler delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"But we were hoping that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yes,  and besides all this is the third day since these things happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They went to his tomb at daybreak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"and found that his body was not there; then they came and told us that besides they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Thereupon some of our own party to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said, but him they did not see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"O foolish men," said Jesus, "slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Behooved it not the Christ to suffer thus, and then to enter into his glory?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And beginning with Moses and the Prophets, he interpreted all the passages concerning himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When they drew near to the village to which they are were going, he appeared to be going farther.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But they urged him to stay with them, saying, "Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So he went in to stay with them. But as he sat down with them, and took bread, and had blessed and broken it, and was handing it to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished out of their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"Were not our hearts burning within us," they said to each other,  "while we were talking with him on the way, and he was opening to us the scriptures?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they rose and returned to Jerusalem that very hour, and found the Eleven and the others all met together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, "The Lord is really risen, and has appeared to Simon!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then they began to tell what happened on the road, and he was known to them when he broke the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While they were yet speaking he stood among them and said, "Peace be to you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were startled and terrified and thought that they were seeing a ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them. "Why are you disturbed? And why do questions rise in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"Look at my hands and my feet. It is I! Feel me and see; for a ghost has not flesh and blood as I have."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he showed them his hands and feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But while they still did not believe it for joy, and were filled with wonder, he asked them, "Have you anything here to eat?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So they gave him a piece of broiled fish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he took it and ate it in their presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he said to them, "These are my words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, how all things must be fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses, and the prophets, and the Psalms concerning me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and he said. "Thus it is written that the Christ should suffer and rise again from the dead, the third day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"and that repentance unto remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"You must bear testimony to this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"And I will send forth the promise of my Father upon you. But tarry in Jerusalem until you are clothed with power from on high."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he led them out until they were over against Bethany; and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it happened that while he was blessing them, that he parted from them and was carried into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
