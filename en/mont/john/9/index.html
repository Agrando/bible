So the man went and washed his eyes, and came back seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Upon this the neighbors and those who used to know him by sight as a beggar, began asking, "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, "It is he." Others said, "No, but he looks like him." "I am the man," he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they asked him, "How then were your eyes opened?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered. "The man who is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash;so I went and washed and received my sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Where is he?" they asked. "I do not know," answered the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they brought the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so the Pharisees again began to ask him questions about how he had regained his sight; and he said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and now I see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then some of the Pharisees began to say, "This man in not from God,  because he does not keep the Sabbath." But others said, "How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So there was a difference of opinion among them. Accordingly they said to the blind man, "What have you to say about him, now that he has opened your eyes?" "He is a prophet," he answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews, however, did not believe about him that he was blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man whose sight had been restored,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and questioned them. "Is this your son," they said, "who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then in reply his parents said. "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who has opened his eyes. Ask him, himself. He is of age. He will speak for himself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This his parents said because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess that he was the Christ, he should be expelled from the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It was because this that his parents said. "He is of age. Ask him,  himself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the Jews a second time summoned the man who had been blind, and said to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Give glory to God! we know that this man is a sinner." Upon this the blind man answered. "I do not know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know, that once I was blind, and know I can see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"What was it he did to you?" they asked him; "How did he open your eyes?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered. "I have told you already, and you did not listen. Why do you wish to hear it again? Can it be that you, too, wish to become his disciples?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they stormed at him. "You are his disciple. We are Moses  disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"We know that God spoke to Moses. But this fellow! We do not know where he comes from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"This is truly astonishing," said the man in reply, "that you do not know where he is from, and yet he has opened my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is God-  fearing and does his will, to such he listens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"Since the beginning of the world such a thing as opening the eyes of one who was born blind was never heard of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"If this man had not come of God he could have done nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered, "You were wholly born in sins, and do you teach us?"  Then they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him,  he said, "Do you believe in the Son of man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Who is he, Sir," he replied, "that I may believe on him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"You have already seen him," Jesus answered, "and it is he who now speaks to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"I do believe, Sir," said the man, and he prostrated himself at his feet. And Jesus said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"For judgment am I come into the world, to make the sightless see,  and to make the seeing blind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and asked, "We are not blind, are we?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"If you were blind," Jesus answered them, "you would have no sin.  But now you are declaring, We see;so your sin remains.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
