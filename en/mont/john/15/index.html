Just as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine, no more can you, unless you abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"I am the Vine you are the branches. He who abides in me and I in him, bears abundant fruit; because apart from me you can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"If any one does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers. Such branches are gathered up and thrown into the fire and burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask whatever your will is, and it shall be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"By this is my Father glorified, by your bearing abundant fruit, and so being my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you; abide in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"If you obey my commands you will abide in my love, just as I have obeyed my Fathers commands and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I have told you these things that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"This is my command, Love one another as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"You are my friends if you do what I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"I no longer call you slaves, because a slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have learned from my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you, that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"This is my command. to love one another.
