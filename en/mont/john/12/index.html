Then said Jesus. "Let her alone.  Against the day of my burial has she kept this;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>for the poor you have with you always, but me you have not always."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the great mass of the Jews learned that Jesus was there, they came not alone because of Jesus, but to see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the chief priests plotted to kill Lazarus too,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because it was on his account that many of the Jews were leaving them, and beginning to believe on Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Next day the big crowd who had come up for the Passover heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and taking branches from the palm trees went out to meet him,  shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord.  Even Israels King!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus found a young ass and seated himself on it, as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Fear not, daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh seated upon an asss colt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus had been glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written concerning him, and what they had done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Meanwhile the crowd which was with him when he summoned Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead, kept witnessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For this reason, too, the crowd came to meet him, because they had heard about this sign which he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the Pharisees said among themselves. "You see! You can do nothing! Look! The world is gone after him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were certain Greeks among those who had come up to worship during the Passover feast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>these came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. "Sir,"  they said, "we want to see Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.  Jesus answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In solemn truth I tell you that except a kernel of wheat fall into the ground and die, it remains a single kernel; but if it die it bears a great crop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who loves his life loses it; and he who regards not his life in this world shall keep it for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any one is ready to serve me, let him follow me; and where I am there shall my servant be also. If any man is ready to serve me, him will my Father honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now is my soul disquieted. What shall I say? Father, save me from this hour?Nay, for this very cause I am come to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify thy name!" Whereupon there came a voice from heaven,  saying, "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the crowd who stood around and heard it, said, "It thundered!"  But others said, "An angel has spoken to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"It is not for my sake," answered Jesus, "that the voice came, but for your sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is a judgment of this world; now will the ruler of this world be driven out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"AND I, IF I BE LIFTED UP FROM THE EARTH, WILL DRAW ALL MEN UNTO MYSELF."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>(In saying this he was signifying by what kind of death he was to die.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the people answered. "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ abides forever. What do you mean by The Son of man must be lifted up?Who is this Son of man?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"The Light is among you a little longer," answered Jesus. "Walk while you have the Light, lest darkness overtake you. He who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become Sons of Light."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>With these words Jesus went away and hid himself from them. But although he had wrought such signs in their presence, still they did not believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So the words spoken by Isaiah, the prophet, were fulfilled. Lord,  who hath believed our message, And to whom hath the Arm of the Lord been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>This was why they could not believe, because Isaiah said again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He hath blinded their eyes and make their hearts hard, Lest they should see with their eyes, perceive with their minds, And should turn, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah uttered these words because he saw his glory, and he spoke of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless, even among the rulers many believed on him, but did not confess in on account of the Pharisees, for fear lest they be put out of the Synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Jesus, speaking in a loud voice, had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"He who believes in me believes not in me, but in Him who sent me;  and he who sees me sees him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Like light am I come into the world, so that no one who believes in me may remain in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if any one hears my words and does not keep them, it is not I who judge him; for I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who rejects me, and does not receive my words, has indeed a judge. The message which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the Last Day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>because I have never spoken on my own authority, but the Father himself who sent me gave me commandment what to say and what words to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So whatever I speak, I speak as the Father has told me."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
