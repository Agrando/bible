And we gazed on his glory - glory as of the Fathers only Son - full of grace and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>John bore witness concerning him, and cried aloud, saying, "This is he of whom I said, He who is coming after me has been put before me,  for he was before me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For out of his fulness we have all received, yes, grace upon grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No man has ever seen God; God, only begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father - he has interpreted him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent some priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He acknowledged - he did not deny it - but acknowledged, "I am not the Christ."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"What then?" they questioned; "Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not."  "Are you the Prophet?" "No," he replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then said they to him. "Who are you? That we may give some answer to those who sent us. What account do you give of yourself?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, "I am a voice of one who cries aloud in the desert, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now it was some of the Pharisees who had been sent to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>so they questioned him, saying, "Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"I indeed am baptizing in water," John said in reply, "but in your midst stands One whom you do not recognize,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>One who is to come after me, whose sandal-strap I am not worthy to untie."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This happened in Bethany, beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said. "Behold, that is Gods Lamb, who takes and bears away the sin of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he of whom I said, After me comes One who has been put before me, for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I myself did not recognize him; I only came baptizing in water, in order that he might be openly shown to Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>John also bore this testimony, saying. "I saw the Spirit like a dove descend from heaven and rest upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I did not recognize him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and resting upon him, is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>This I have seen, and I am become a witness to the fact that he is the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Next day again, John was standing with two of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>After gazing intently on Jesus as he walked about, he said, "Look!  that is the Lamb of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The two disciples heard his exclamation, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus turned and saw them following him, and said, "What do you want?" They replied, "Rabbi" (which may be translated Teacher), "where are you staying?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He said to them, "Come, and you shall see." So they went and saw where he was staying, and spent that day with him. It was then about four oclock in the afternoon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two men who heard what John said and followed Jesus, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>In the morning he found his brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (a word which means Christ, the Anointed One).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked intently at him and said. "You are Simon, son of John; you shall be called Cephas" (or Peter,  which means Rock).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Next day Jesus decided to go into Galilee; and he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip belonged to Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then Philip found Nathanael and told him, "We have found him about whom Moses wrote in the Law, as did the prophets - Jesus of Nazareth,  Josephs son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"  Philip said to him, "Come and see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and said, "Behold a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"How do you know me?" asked Nathanael. "Before Philip called you,"  replied Jesus, "when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"Rabbi," answered Nathanael, "you are the Son of God; you are King of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said in reply. "Do you believe because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>You shall see greater things than that! Believe me," he added, "you all shall see heaven opened wide, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
