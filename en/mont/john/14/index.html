You trust in God, trust in me also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In my Fathers house there are many rooms If it were not so, would I have told you that I went to prepare a place for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will return and will take you to be with me, so that where I am you may be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the way is known to you all, where I am going."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"We do not know where you are going Lord," said Thomas, "so how can we know the way?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus answered him. "I am the Way, the Truth and the Life. No man ever comes to the Father but by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you had known me, you would have known my Father too; from now on you know him and have seen him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Lord," said Philip, "cause us to see the Father, and we shall be satisfied."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Have I been so long among you, and yet you, Philip, have you not recognized me? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, Cause us to see the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me?  The words that I speak to you I speak not of myself; but the Father,  who ever dwells in me, is doing his own work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Believe me, all of you, that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very words sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"I tell you solemnly that he who trusts in me shall himself do the works that I am doing; and still greater works than these, because I am going to my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"And whatever you ask in my name I will do; that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"If you ask anything in my name, I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"If you love me, you will obey my commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"and I will pray the Father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"and he will give you another Comforter to be with you forever, the Spirit of Truth. The world cannot receive him because it does not see him nor know him, but you know him, for he is ever with you and within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"I will not leave you comfortless; I will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Yet a little while and the world shall see me no more, but you shall see me; because I live, you, too, shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"At that day you shall understand that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"It is he who has my commands and obeys them that loves me; and he who loves me shall be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"How is it, Lord," said Judas (not Iscariot) "that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus replied."If any loves me he will obey my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"He that loves me not does not obey words, and yet the words to which you are listening are not mine, but the Fathers who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"All this I told you while still with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you everything, and bring to your remembrance everything that I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Peace I leave with you. My own peace I give to you. It is not the worlds Peace I give you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"You heard me tell you, I am going away, and yet I am coming to you. If you loved me you would have been glad because I said I am going to the Father, for my Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"And now I tell you this before it happens, so that when it does happen you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"I shall not talk with you much more, for the Prince of this world is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"He has nothing in me, but in his coming the world may know that I love the Father, and that I do just as the Father commanded. Rise,  let us be going!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
