Whoever enters by me shall be saved, and he shall go in and come out and find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"The thief never comes except to steal and kill and destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his very life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"The hired servant, since he is not a shepherd and does not own his sheep, leaves the sheep and flees when he sees a wolf coming - and the wolf worries them and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"He is only a hired servant, and the sheep are no care to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"I am the good shepherd. I know my sheep, and my sheep know me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>just as the Father knows me, I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"I have other sheep also, which do not belong to this fold. I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"The Father loves me for this, because I am laying down my life that I may take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"No man is taking it away from me. I am laying it down on my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Jews were again divided over these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them kept saying. "He has a demon and is mad! Why do you listen to him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others were saying. "These are not the words of one demon-possessed.  Can a demoniac open the eyes of the blind?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It was winter, and Jesus used to walk in the Temple, in Solomons Portico.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then all the Jews encircled him and kept asking him. "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them. "I have told you, and you do not believe. The works which I am doing in my Fathers name, these bear witness concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"I am giving them eternal life, and they shall never perish, nor shall any one snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"My Father who has given them to me is stronger than all, and no one can snatch them out of my Fathers hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"I and my Father are one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews again took stones with which to stone him. Jesus said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"I have shown you many good deeds from my Father. For which of these are you going to stone me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"We are not going to stone you for a good deed," answered the Jews,  "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, are making yourself God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Is it written in your law," replied Jesus, "I said, You are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"If those to whom the word of God came are called gods (and the Scripture cannot be annulled),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you mean to tell me, whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"If I am not doing the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"But if I am doing them, then though you believe not me, believe the deeds, in order that you may come to know and keep on clearly understanding that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then again they attempted to seize him, but he escaped out of their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Many who came to him said, "John did not perform any signs, but everything he said about this man was true."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed on him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
