King of the Jews!" They also gave him blow after blow with their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate again came forth and said to the people, "See, I am going to bring his out to you, that you may clearly know that I find no crime in him,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then as Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, "BEHOLD, THE MAN!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So when the chief priests and the police saw him, they shouted.  "Crucify him! Crucify him!" "Take him yourselves and crucify him,"  said Pilate, "for I find no crime in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself out to be Gods Son,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now when Pilate heard these words he was more alarmed than ever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and entering the Praetorium again, he said to Jesus, "What is your origin?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus made no answer. So Pilate said to him. "Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, or power to crucify you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"You would have no power over me," answered Jesus, "unless it had been given you from above. For this reason he who has betrayed me to you has the greater sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After that Pilate began to seek to release him, but the Jews shouted out. "If you release this man you are no friend of the Emperor. Any man who makes himself out to be king is a rebel against the Emperor."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On hearing what they said, Pilate brought Jesus out and made him sit on the judges seat in a place called the Mosaic Pavement (the Hebrew name is Gabbatha).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about six oclock in the morning. Then he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they shouted. "Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"  "Crucify your King?" said Pilate. The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then he gave him over to them to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they took Jesus, who went forth bearing his own cross, to a place called The Place of a Skull - in the Hebrew tongue, Golgotha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There they crucified him; and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate moreover wrote an inscription and placed it above the cross. What he wrote was, "JESUS, THE NAZARENE, KING OF THE JEWS"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This inscription was read by many of the Jews, because the place where they crucified Jesus was near the city, and the inscription was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write King of the Jews, but He said, I am King of the Jews."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, to each soldier a part, and the tunic.  Now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>so the soldiers said one to another. "Let us not tear it. Let us draw lots, to see whose it shall be" - that the Scripture might be fulfilled. They divided my garments among them, For my raiment did they cast lots. This was what the soldiers did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there stood near the cross of Jesus, his mother and his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Jesus saw his mother, and standing near her the disciple whom he loved, he said to his mother, "Woman behold your son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to the disciple, "Behold your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her to his home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After that, when Jesus knew that everything was now accomplished, he said in fulfilment of the words of Scripture, "I am thirsty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There was a jar full of vinegar standing there; and they filled a sponge with vinegar, and put it upon a stalk of hyssop, and put it to his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then after he had taken the vinegar, Jesus said, "IT IS FINISHED!"  And bowing his head, he yielded up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It was Preparation Day, so in order to prevent the bodies hanging on the cross during the Sabbath (for the Sabbath was a great day) the Jews begged Pilate to have the legs broken, and the bodies taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other who had been crucified with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But upon coming to Jesus they saw that he was already dead, and did not break his legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a lance, and immediately blood and water flowed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he who saw it has borne testimony, and his testimony is trustworthy, and he knows that he is telling the truth in order that you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For this happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled, Not one of his bones shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another Scripture says, They shall look on him whom they have pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus,  but in secret because of fear of the Jews, asked Pilate for permission to take the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and took the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nicodemus also (the one who visited Jesus by night, at first) came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing nearly a hundred pounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen with the spices, according to the Jewish mode of burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There was a garden near the place where Jesus had been crucified,  and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Here, because of its being Preparation Day, and as the tomb was near by, they placed Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
