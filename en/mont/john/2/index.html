My time is not yet come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother said to the attendants, "Whatever he may tell you to do,  do it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were six stone water - jars standing there, according to the Jewish rites of purification, each holding about twenty gallons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said, "Fill up the jars with water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they filled them brimful. Then he said, "Draw some out now, and carry it to the master of the feast."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So they carried it. And when the master of the feast had tasted of the water which had been made wine, not knowing where it came from,  though the attendants who had drawn it knew, he called the bridegroom and said to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Everybody serves first the good wine, and when people have drunk freely, the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This beginning of signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and showed forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Afterward he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brothers and his disciples, and remained there a few days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There he found in the temple those who were selling cattle and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he plaited a scourge of rushes, and drove all out of the temple -  both the sheep and oxen. He began to pour out the coins of the money-  changers, and to overturn their tables,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said to those who were selling doves. "Take these things away!  Make not my Fathers house a house of trade!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His disciples recalled that it is written, The zeal of thine house will devour me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the Jews asked Jesus, "What sign are you going to show us,  seeing that you do these things?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Destroy this temple," answered Jesus, "and in three days I will raise it up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jews retorted, "This Temple took forty-six years to build, and will you raise it in three days?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he was speaking about the temple of his body; and when the disciples recalled what he had said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>after he had been raised from the dead, they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, when they beheld the signs which he did;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but for his part Jesus was not trusting himself to them, because he knew all men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and did not need any ones testimony concerning man, for he himself knew what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
