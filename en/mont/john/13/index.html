In solemn truth I tell you, the cock shall not crow before you have three times disowned me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So while supper was proceeding, and the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given everything into his hands,  and that he was come from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and was now going to God, rose from supper, laid aside his upper garments, and took a towel and girded himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then he poured water into the basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples and to wipe them with the towel with which he had girded himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he came to Simon Peter, who said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand it later."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter answered, "No, never shall you wash my feet." "If I do not wash you," said Jesus, "you have no part in me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Lord," said Simon Peter, "not my feet only, but also my hands and my head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said. "He who has bathed needs only to have his feet washed,  and he is altogether clean; and you are clean, but not all of you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(For he knew who should betray him, for that reason he said that they were not every one of them clean.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So after he had washed their feet, and had put on his upper garments again, and taken his place, he said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Do you understand what I have been doing to you? You call me Teacher and Master,and you say well, for such I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If then I have washed your feet, I the Master and the Teacher, you also ought to wash one anothers feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for I have given you an example, that you also should do what I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In solemn truth I tell you that a slave is not greater than his master, neither is a messenger greater than the one who sends him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I do not speak concerning all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but it is that the Scripture may be fulfilled, which says. "He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"From this time forward, I tell you before it comes to pass, that when it is come to pass you may believe who I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In solemn truth I tell you, he who receives any one that I send is receiving me; and he who receives me is receiving Him who sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When he had spoken thus, Jesus was deeply moved. He testified and said, "In solemn truth I tell you that one of you will betray me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the disciples began looking at one another, wondering which one of them he meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>There was reclining upon Jesus breast one of the disciples whom he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Simon Peter beckoned to him, saying, "Ask who it is about whom he is speaking."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So that disciples just leaned back against Jesus breast and said to him, "Lord, who is it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"It is that one," answered Jesus," to whom I am going to give a piece of bread, after dipping it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So when he had dipped the bread, he took it and gave it to Judas Iscariot, son of Simon. And after he had received the piece of bread,  Satan entered into him. "What you do, do quickly," said Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now no one at the table understood why he said this to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for some were thinking, as Judas kept the purse, that Jesus meant to tell him, "Buy the things that we need for the feast," or that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When he had taken the piece of bread, Judas went out immediately;  and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So when he was gone, Jesus said. "Now has the Son of man been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God has been glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and straightway will he glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"My little children, I am only to be with you a little longer. You will seek me; just as I said to the Jews, Where I go you cannot come, so now I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I give you a new commandment, Love one another!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?" "Where I am going," answered Jesus, "you cannot follow me now; but you shall follow me later."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Why cannot I follow you now, Master?" said Peter. "I will lay down my life for you." Jesus answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>missing fehlt/missing</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
