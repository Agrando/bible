He showed himself as follows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>There were together Simon Peter and Thomas, called "The Twin," and Nathanael, from Cana of Galilee, and the two sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They answered him,  "And we are going with you." So they went out and got into the boat,  and throughout the night they caught nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when day was dawning Jesus stood on the beach. The disciples,  however, did not recognize that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Jesus said to them, "Lads, you havent any fish, have you?" They answered him, "No."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to them, "Cast your net on the right side of the boat,  and you will find." So they cast it, and now they could not haul it in for the multitude of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"  On hearing that it was the Lord, Simon Peter girt his fishers coat about him (for he was naked), and threw himself into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The rest of the disciples came in the boat, for they were not far from shore - only about a hundred yards - dragging in the net full of fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they got to the shore they beheld a charcoal fire ready laid,  with fish on it, and some bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Bring some of the fish you have just caught," Jesus told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Simon Peter went and dragged the net to shore, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; but for all this number the net was not torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Come and have breakfast," said Jesus to them. Not one of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" Knowing that it was the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus went and took bread and gave it to them, and the fish also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This was the third time that Jesus showed himself to the disciples after he had risen from among the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they were through breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon,  son of John, do you love me more than these others do?" "Yes, Lord,  you know that you are dear to me." he answered. Jesus said to him,  "Feed my lambs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"  He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that you are dear to me." "Be a shepherd to my sheep," said Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The third time Jesus asked him, "Am I really dear to you?" Peter was grieved because the third time he asked, "Am I really dear to you?"  and he answered, "Master, you know all things, you know that you are dear to me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Feed my sheep," said Jesus. "In solemn truth I tell you that when you were young, you used to put on your own girdle, and walk wherever you wished; but when you grow old you will stretch out your hands for some one to gird you, and carry you where you do not wish to go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This he said to show by what kind of death Peter was to glorify God.  After speaking thus, he said to him, "Follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Peter turned around and saw that the disciple whom Jesus loved was following - he who at the supper leaned back upon his breast and said,  "Lord, who is to betray you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>On catching sight of him, Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, what about him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"If I choose that he remain until I come," said Jesus, "what is that to you? Do you follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Accordingly the report spread among the brothers that this disciple should not die; but Jesus did not say that he was not to die, but said, "If I choose that he remain until I come, what is that to you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It is this disciple who bears testimony to these facts and who recorded them; and we know that his testimony is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But there are also many other things which Jesus did; if every one of them were to be recorded in detail I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would have to be written.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
