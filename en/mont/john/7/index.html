"Leave here and go into Judea, so that your disciples also may behold the works which you are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"For no one ever does anything in secret if he himself seeks to be known publicly. If you are performing these signs, show yourself openly to the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even his own brothers did not believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"My time is not yet come," said Jesus, "but your time is always at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"The world cannot hate you, but me it does hate, because I am bearing testimony against it, that its ways are wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do you go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast,  because my time is not yet fully come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After saying this, he remained in Galilee; but after his brothers had gone up to feast,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>then he went too - not openly, but as it were a secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews meanwhile kept looking for him at feast, and saying, "Where is he?" "I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own Name these whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and there was much disputing about him among the crowd. Some would say, "He is a good man." Others. "No! he is misleading the people."  "While I was with them I kept them by the power of thy name which thou hast given me. I guarded them, and none of them was lost except the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No one, however, was speaking openly about him, for fear of the Jews. "But now I am coming to thee, and I am speaking these things while I am in the world, so that they may have my joy in all its fulness in themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when it was already the middle of the feast, Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach. "I have given them thy word; and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews were amazed. They said, "How does this fellow know the sacred writings when he has never learned them?" "I am not asking that thou wilt take them out of the world, but that thou wilt protect them from the Evil One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In reply Jesus said to them; "My teaching is not mine, but is his who sent me. "They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"If any one wills to do Gods will he shall know concerning my teaching, whether it is from God, or I speak my own authority.  "Dedicate them in thy truth; thy word is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"The man who speaks on his own authority is always seeking his own glory. But one who is eager for the glory of Him who sent him, he is true, and therefore is nothing false about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Did not Moses give you the Law? Yet none of you is keeping the Law.  Why are you seeking to kill me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The crowd answered. "You have a demon! Who is trying kill you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered them. "There was one thing I did, and you are all amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Consider, therefore, Moses has given you circumcision - not that Moses originated it, but the fathers - and you are accustomed to circumcise a child even on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"If a child receives circumcision on the Sabbath, in order that the Law of Moses may not be broken, how can you be angry with me because I made a man sound and well on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Do not judge according to appearance. Judge justly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then some of the men of Jerusalem were saying. "Is not this the man they are seeking to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"And look! he is speaking boldly and they are saying nothing to him.  Can it possibly be that the rulers have really discovered that he is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"But we know this man and where he is from; but when the Christ comes no one will know where he comes from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Jesus cried aloud as he was teaching in the Temple, and said.  "You both know me and you know where I am from; and I am not come on my own authority, but he who sent me is trustworthy, and him you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"But I now him, because I am from him and he sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they kept seeking to arrest him, but no man laid hands on him,  because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many of the crowd believed on him and began to say, "The Christ,  when he comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the high priest and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus said to them. "Still for a little longer I am with you,  and then I am going my way to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"You will search for me and will not find me, and where I am you cannot come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then the Jews said to one another. "Where does this fellow intend to go, so that we shall not find him? He is not intending to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and to teach the Greeks, is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"What does he mean saying, You shall seek me and you shall not find me, and Where I am you cannot come?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now the last day, that the great day of the feast, Jesus stood up and cried in a loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"If any man thirst let him come to me and drink. From the heart of him who believes in me will flow, as the Scripture said, rivers of living water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now he said this concerning the Spirit whom those who believed in him should receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Some of the crowd who had been listening to these discourses began to say, "Without a doubt this man is a Prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Other said, "He is the Christ." But others were saying. "Surely the Christ is not to come out of Galilee, is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"Does not the Scripture say that the Christ is coming of the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, Davids town?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So a division arose in the crowd concerning him. Some of them wished to apprehend him, but no one laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then the officers returned to the chief priest and Pharisees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and they asked them, "Why have you not brought him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, "Never yet did a man speak like this man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Surely you have not been led astray, have you? answered the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"Has any one of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"As for this mob who do not understand the Law, they are accursed!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus, one of their number, he who had formerly visited Jesus,  said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"Our law does not condemn the accused, does it, before hearing his defense, and finding out what he is doing?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>In answer they said to him. "You are not from Galilee, are you?  Search for yourself, and see that from Galilee arises no prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then they departed each to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
