Still sobbing she stooped and looked into the tomb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and gazed at two angels in glistening white sitting, one at the head the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She answered,  "Because they have taken away my Master, and I do not know where they have laid him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When she had said this she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but did not know that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her. "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that he was the gardener, said to him, "Sir,  if you have borne him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away, myself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Mary," said Jesus. She turned to him. "Rabboni!" she cried in Hebrew. That is to say, "Teacher."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Do not cling to me," said Jesus, "for I am not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, "I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Away went Mary Magdalene to the disciples with the tidings, "I have seen the Master!" and that he said these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>On the evening of that same day, the first day of the week, although the doors of the room where the disciples gathered had been locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came, and there he stood among them,  saying. "Peace to you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As he said this he showed them his hands and his side. Then were the disciple glad, when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus said to them again. "Peace to you. As my Father has sent me forth, I also now am sending you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he had said this he breathed upon them and said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Receive the Holy Spirit. If you remit any ones sins, they are remitted; if you retain them they are retained."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thomas, one of the Twelve, who was called "The Twin." was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Accordingly the other disciples kept telling him, "We have seen the Lord." But he told them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and thrust my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Jesus came, although the doors were locked, and stood there among and said. "Peace to you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then to Thomas he said. "Place your finger here, and see my hands;  and place your hand here, and thrust it into my side, and become not unbelieving, but believing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Because you have seen me, Thomas, you have believed," Jesus told him. "Blessed are those who, without seeing, yet believed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There were then many other signs which Jesus performed in the presence of his disciples, which have not been written in this book;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
