I did not, however,  speak of these things at first, because I was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"But now I go my way to Him who sent me, yet none of you asks me,  Where are you going?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"but sorrow has filled your hearts because I have told you these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Yet - I am telling you the truth - my going is for your good. For unless I go away the Comforter will not come to you; but if I depart I will send him unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And he, when he comes, will convict the world of sins and of righteousness and of judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"of sin, because they do not believe in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"because the Prince of this world has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them just now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"But when he is come, that Spirit of Truth, he will guide you into the whole truth. For he will not speak on his own authority, but all that he hears he will speak, and will make known to you that which is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"He will glorify me; for he will take of what is mine and will make known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Everything that the Father has is mine; that is why I said that he will take of what is mine and make it known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"In a little while you shall behold me no more; and again in a little while you shall see me, because I am going to the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At this some of his disciples said among themselves. "What does he mean by telling us, In a little while you shall behold me no more;  and again in a little while you shall see me, and because I am going to the Father?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they kept asking. "What does that little while mean of which he speaks? We do not know what he is talking about."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus perceived that they wanted to ask him, and said. "Are you questioning one another about my saying, A little while and you shall behold me no more, and again a little while you shall see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"I tell you solemnly that you will be weeping and wailing while the world is rejoicing; you will be grief-stricken, but your grief shall be turned into gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"A woman in labor has grief because her hour is come; but when she has given birth to the babe she no longer remembers her anguish,  because of joy that a child has been born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"So you also have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your heart will rejoice, and your joy shall no man snatch away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"And in that day you will ask me no questions. Most solemnly I tell you that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Hitherto you have asked nothing in my name; ask, and you shall receive, that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"I have told you these things in figures; but the time is coming when I shall no longer speak in figures, but will tell you about the Father in plain words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"In that day you shall pray in my name; and I do not tell you that I will ask the Father on your behalf;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and believed that I came forth from the God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world. again, I am leaving the world, and am going to the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Ah," said the disciples, "now you are speaking plain language, and not using figures. Now we are sure that you know all things, and have no need for any one to question you; by this we believe that you came forth from God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Do you now believe?" said Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"behold the hour approaches and is already come when you will be scattered, each man to his home, and will leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"I have said all this to you that in me you might have peace. In the world you will have tribulation, but be courageous; I have overcome the world."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
