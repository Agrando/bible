And the first voice that I heard speaking with me was like a trumpet, saying,  "Come up hither, and I will show you the things that must come to pass hereafter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, there stood a throne in heaven, and upon the throne One sat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he who sat was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius;  and there was a rainbow round about the throne, like an emerald to look upon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And round about the throne were four and twenty Elders seated, who were clothed in white raiment, with golden crowns upon their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>From the throne issued lightning and voices and thunders. Seven blazing lamps were burning before the throne; these are the seven Spirits of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in front of the throne as it seemed, a glassy sea like crystal;  and in the midst of the throne and encircling it are four Living Creatures, full of eyes before and behind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The first creature was like a lion, and the second like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a mans, and the fourth creature was like an eagle flying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the four Living Creatures, each one with six wings, are full of eyes round about and within; day and night they are chanting ceaselessly. "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty.
