And the dragon stood before the woman about to be delivered, so that he might devour her child when she was delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she gave birth to a son, a man child, who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God and unto his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the woman fled into the desert, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for a thousand two hundred and threescore days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels went forth to war with the dragon; and the dragon also fought, and his angels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but they failed, nor was their place found any more in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the great dragon was thrown down - that old Serpent, he who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I heard a great voice in heaven, which said. "Now it is come!  the salvation and the power, The kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ! For the accuser of our brethren is thrown down, Who accused them before our God, day and night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb, And by the word of their testimony; And they loved not their life, even unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore rejoice, O heavens, And you who dwell therein! Woe to the earth and the sea! For the devil has gone down to you in great fury,  Because he knows that he has but little time."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he pursued the woman who gave birth to the man child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly into the desert to her place where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the serpent poured water from his mouth after the woman, water like a river, so that he might cause her to be carried off by the stream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the earth came to the rescue of the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had poured forth from his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the dragon was enraged at the woman, and went away to make war upon the rest of her children who keep the commandments of God, and hold fast the testimony of Jesus. And he stood upon the sand of the sea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
