These are the words of Him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, and who walks among the seven golden candlesticks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know your works and your toil and stedfastness, and that you cannot endure evil men, and that you tested those who called themselves apostles, though they are not, and how you found them false.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You are holding fast, and have borne up for my namess sake, and have not grown weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But I have this against you, that you have left your first love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Remember whence you have fallen, and turn again, and do your first works. Otherwise I am coming to you and will remove your candlestick out of its place, unless you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him that overcomes, to him will I give to eat from the tree of life which is in the garden of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And unto the angel of the Church in Smyrna, write. These are the words of the First and the Last, he who died and has returned to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know your persecution and your poverty - but you are rich! I know the reviling of those who say that they themselves are Jews, when they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear not what you are about to suffer! Behold, the devil is indeed going to put some of you in prison, that you may be tested, and you will have persecution for ten days. Be faithful even unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let him who has ears, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the angel of the Church in Pergamum, write These are the words of Him who holds the sharp two-edged sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know where you dwell, where the throne of Satan is; and yet you are holding fast my name, and you have not denied my faith, even in the days of Antipas, my witness, my faithful one, who was slain among you, where Satan has his dwelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-  block before the sons of Israel, to eat food offered to idols, and to practise immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So you have also some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent; if you do not I will very soon come to you, and will make war upon them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who has ears, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To him that overcomes I will give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written,  which no man knows, but he that receives it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to the angel of the Church in Thyatira, write. These are the words of the Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet like burnished brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know your works and your love and faith and service and endurance;  I know that your last works are more than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have this against you, that you are tolerating that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and she is teaching and leading my slaves astray, leading them to practise immorality, and to eat food which has been sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have given her time for repentance; but she is determined not to turn from her immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I will lay her on a sick bed, and bring great distress upon those who have committed adultery with her, unless they turn away from her works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And moreover, her children will I kill with pestilence. And all the churches shall know that I am he who searches the hearts and souls of men. I will give to each of you according to his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to the rest of you in Thyatira, those who do not hold his teaching, and who do not know the "deep things" of Satan (as they call them),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I say that I am imposing upon you no fresh burden; only hold fast what you have till I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>To him that overcomes and perseveres in my works to the end, will I give authority over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he shall shepherd them with a rod of iron, shattering them like earthen vessels (as I myself have received from my Father),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I will give him the Morning Star."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let him who has an ear, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
