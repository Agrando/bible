"Behold, Gods tent is with men, And he will tent with them, And they will be his peoples. And God himself will be with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no more, Nor will there be mourning, Nor crying, nor pain any more.  Because the first things have passed away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He who sat on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." And He said to me, "Write this, for these words are trustworthy and genuine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He also said. "It has now come to pass. I am the Alpha and the Omega, The Beginning and the End. To him who thirsts I will freely give Of the spring of the Water of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who overcomes will inherit these, And I will be his God, And he shall be my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But as for the cowards, the faithless, the abominable, And for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, Idolaters, and all liars, Their part will be in the lake that blazes with fire and brimstone. "This is the second death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came to me one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls filled with the last plagues, and he spoke to me, saying. "Come hither! I will show you the bride, the Lambs wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain, huge and high;  and he showed me the Holy City, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It had the glory of God. Its light was like some precious stone,  like jasper, clear as crystal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>with a wall great and high, and twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels; and names written thereon, the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On the east were three gates; and on the north, three gates; and on the south, three gates; and on the west, three gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he who spoke had a golden reed, as a measure, to measure the city and its gates and walls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the city lies foursquare; the length of it is as great as the breadth. Then he measured the city with the reed, fifteen hundred miles; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he measured its wall, two hundred and sixteen feet, mans measure, which is an angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And its wall is made of jasper; but the city is of pure gold, like pure glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with all kings of precious stones. The first foundation-stone was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each gate of one pearl. And the broad street of the city was of pure gold, transparent like glass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I saw no temple in the city; For the temple is the Lord God, the Almighty, And the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the city has no need of the sun, Nor of the moon, to shine upon it; For the glory of God has lightened it, And its lamp is the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the nations will walk by its light. And into it the kings of the earth will bring their glory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And its gates will not be shut by day, (For there is no night there);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they will bring the glory and honor Of the nations into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>There will not enter it anything profane, Nor any who work abominations and a lie; But only those who are written In the Lambs Book of Life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
