After that it is necessary to loose him for a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I saw thrones, and those who sat on them, and they were permitted to judge; and I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the Word of God, those who did not worship the beast nor his image, and who did not receive his brand upon their brow, or hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed and holy is he who has a part in the first resurrection; on such the second death has no power, but they will be Gods priests,  and Christs; and will reign with him for a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the thousand years have been completed, Satan will be loosed out of his prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and will go forth to seduce the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to marshal them for war - their number is like the sands of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they went up over the broad earth, and surrounded the encampment of the saints, and the beloved city. Then fire fell from the sky and consumed them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the devil who had been deceiving them was hurled into the lake of fire and brimstone, where lie also the beast and the false prophet. And they will be tortured day and night, forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw a great white throne, and One who sat thereon; from his presence fled earth and sky, and no place was found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and books were opened, and another book - the Book of Life - was opened;  and the dead were judged according to their deeds, by what was written in the books.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And all were judged according to their deeds. And Death and Hades were hurled into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if any one was found who was not written in the Book of Life, he was hurled into the lake of fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
