On each side of the river was a Tree of Life, Bearing twelve kinds of fruit, Each month yielding its own fruit. And the leaves of the tree Were for the healing of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And there will be no more curse But in it will be the throne of God and of the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his slaves will serve and worship him.

I am only a fellow slave with you and your brothers, the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this Book. "WORSHIP GOD!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the crisis is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who is wicked, let him be wicked still; He who is filthy, let him be filthy still; He who is righteous, lit him practise righteousness still; And he who is holy, let him be made holy still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, To give to each man what his actions merit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am the Alpha and the Omega, The First and the Last, The Beginning and the End.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Blessed are they who wash their robes, so that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in by the gates into the City.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Without are the dogs, the sorcerers, the immoral, the murderers, the idolaters, and all who live and make a lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches.
