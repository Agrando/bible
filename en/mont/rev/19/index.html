"Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power Unto the Lord our God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For true and righteous are his judgments; For he has judged the great harlot Who was corrupting the earth with her fornication. On her he has avenged the blood of his slaves."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And a second time they said. "Allelulia! For the smoke of her torment goes up forever and ever!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the four and twenty Elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen, Hallelujah!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all you his slaves, All you who fear him, small and great!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard a sound like the voice of a great multitude, and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunderings,  saying. "Alleluia, for the Lord God omnipotent reigns!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let us rejoice and triumph and give him the glory; For the marriage of the Lamb is come, And his bride has made herself ready,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it has been granted to her to array herself in fine linen,  bright and pure; For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, Write, "Blessed are those who have been bidden to the marriage supper of the Lamb." And he said to me, "These are true words of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I fell down at his feet to worship him, and he said to me. "See that you do it not. I am a fellow slave of yours and of your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus; for the testimony of Jesus is the vital breath of prophecy."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw heaven opened, and lo! a white horse; and he who sat upon him was named "Faithful and True"; and in righteousness does he judge and make war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems;  and he has a name written, which none knows but himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He is clothed in a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called,  THE WORD OF GOD</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the armies of heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there issues from his lips a sharp sword with which to smite the nations. He shall shepherd them with a rod of iron. And he treads the winepress of the passion of the anger of Almighty God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And on his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I saw an angel standing in the sun, who shouted in a loud voice to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, "Come, gather yourselves together to the great supper of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of generals, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, bond and free,  small and great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war on him who sat on the horse and on his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed miracles in his presence to deceive those who had received the brand of the beast, and those who worshiped his image. The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire, blazing with brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rest were slain with the sword of him who sat on the horse,  that sword which issued from his lips. And all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
