"Do not weep! Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, and so can open the book with its seven seals."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I beheld a Lamb standing as if slain in the midst of the throne and of the four Living Creatures, and in the midst of the Elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes (which are the seven Spirits of God,  sent forth into all the earth).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he went, and now he has taken the book out of the right hand of Him who was seated on the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When he took the book, the four Living Creatures and the four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb. And each had a harp and a golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they sang a new song, saying, "Worthy art thou to take the book And to open its seals; For thou wast slain and didst ransom for God Men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thou hast made them kings and priests unto our God, And they shall reign on earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I looked and heard a voice of many angels encircling the throne and a voice of the Living Creatures and of the Elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>singing aloud, "Worthy is the Lamb who has been slain, To receive power and riches and wisdom And might and honor and glory and blessing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard every created thing that is in heaven, or on earth, or beneath the earth, or on the sea, and all things that are in them,  saying, "To him who sits on the throne, And to the Lamb, Be the blessing and the honor, And the glory and the power, Forever and ever!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the four Living Creatures kept saying, "Amen!" And the Elders fell down and worshiped.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
