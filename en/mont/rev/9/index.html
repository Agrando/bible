And the sun and the air grew dark, because of the smoke out of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth; they were given power like that of scorpions on the earth..</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They were told not to hurt the grass of the earth, nor any plant,  nor any tree, but only those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yet they were not permitted to kill them, but only to torture them for five months. Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion,  when it stings a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In those days men will seek death, and will not find it; they will long to die, but death ever flees from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The appearance of the locusts was like horses equipped for battle.  On their heads there was something like crowns of gold, and their faces were like mens faces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were like lions teeth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and they had breastplates something like breastplates of iron; and the noise of their wings was like the noise of chariots, of many horses rushing into battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they have tails like scorpions, and stings, and their power to torture men five months was in their tails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They have a king over them, the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon; in Greek he is called Apollyon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"The first woe has passed; and still there are two woes to follow."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet; and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>one saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, "Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the four angels that were held in readiness for that hour and day and month and year, were let loose, to destroy a third of mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The number of the hosts of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and thus I saw the horses in the vision and their riders. They had breastplates of fire, "red as fire, dark blue as jacinth, and yellow as sulphur." The heads of the horses were like lions heads, and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By these three plagues a third of mankind were killed; by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which issued from their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails.  For their tails are like serpents with heads, and with them they work woe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the rest of mankind who were not killed with these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands. They would not give up the worship of demons and of idols made of gold and silver, and brass,  and stone, and wood, which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries,  nor of their immorality, nor of their thefts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
