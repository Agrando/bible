They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from among men to be the first-fruits unto God and the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>No lie was ever found on their lips; they are spotless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I saw another angel who was flying in mid-heaven. He had an eternal evangel, to evangelize all the dwellers on the earth, of every nation and tribe and tongue and people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he cried with a loud voice. "Fear God and give him glory,  Because the hour of his judgment is come. And worship Him who made the heavens and the earth And the sea and springs of waters."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then a second angel followed, crying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great, Who has made all the nations drink the wine Of the frenzy of her fornication."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And another angel, a third, followed them, crying with a mighty voice. "Whoever worships the beast and his image, And receives a brand on his forehead or on his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, Poured out unmixed in the cup of his anger; And he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone In the presence of the holy angels, And in the presence of the Lamb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; And they have no rest day or night, Who worship the beast and his image, And all who receive the brand of his name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, "Write, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth! Yea, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, For their deeds do follow them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I looked, and lo, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw One sitting like to a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another angel came out of the temple, shouting with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud. "Thrust in your sickle, and reap; for the time to reap is come. The harvest of the earth is overripe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he who sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, and he,  too, had a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another angel came from the altar, the angel who has power over fire, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle, And gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, For its grapes are fully ripe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the angel thrust his sickle into the earth and gathered the clusters of the vine of the earth, and threw them into the winepress,  the great winepress of the wrath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood gushed out of the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as two hundred miles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
