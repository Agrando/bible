To him who sat on it, it was allowed to take peace from the earth, and to cause men to kill one another; and a great sword was given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third Living Creature say, "Come!" And I saw, and lo, a black horse! He who sat on him had a balance in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard the semblance of a voice in the midst of the four Living Creatures, saying. "A quart of wheat for a shilling, and three quarts of barley for a shilling; but do not harm the oil and the wine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth Living Creature calling, "Come!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So I liked, and lo, a pale horse; and he who sat on him was named Death; and Hades was following after him. To them was given authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the wild beasts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they bore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And with a loud voice they cried, saying, "O Master, holy and true,  How long dost thou not judge And avenge our blood On those who dwell on the earth?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there was given to each one of them a white robe; and they were told that they should rest for yet a little time, until the number should be completed by their fellow slaves and their brethren who were about to be put to death as they had been.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black, like sackcloth, and the full moon became like blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and the stars of the sky fell to earth, as a fig tree shaken by a gale drops its unripe figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the sky parted asunder like a rolled-up scroll; and every mountain and island was moved out of its place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the kings of the earth, and the princes, and the generals, the rich and the mighty, both slaves and freemen, every one of them hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they began to say to the mountains and to the rocks. "Fall upon us and hide us From the face of him who is seated upon the throne,  And from the wrath of the Lamb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Great Day of their wrath has come, And who is able to stand?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
