And it was turned to loathsome and painful sores upon all who bore the brand of the beast, and who worshiped his image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea; and it became blood, like the blood of a corpse, and every living creature died -  everything in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of waters; and they were turned into blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I heard the angel of the waters saying. "Righteous art thou,  thou who art and wast, The Holy One, Because thou didst inflict this judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For men poured out the blood of thy saints and prophets, And thou hast given them blood to drink. And this they deserved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I heard the altar saying, "Yea, O Lord, the Almighty, True and righteous are thy judgments."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the fourth angel poured out his bowl upon the sun, and the sun was permitted to scorch men with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And men were scorched with the terrible heat; and they blasphemed the name of the God who had the power over these plagues; yet they repented not, to give him glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the fifth poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened, and men gnawed their tongues for pain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they blasphemed the God of heaven, because of their pains and their sores; yet of their deeds they did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sixth poured his bowl upon the great river, the River Euphrates, and its water was dried up so as to make ready the way for the kings that come from the sunrising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I saw three unclean spirits, like frogs, coming out of the dragons mouth, and the beasts mouth, and the false prophets mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For these are the spirits of demons performing miracles, who go forth to the kings of the habitable earth, to gather them together for the battle of the great Day of God, the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lo, I am coming like a thief.
