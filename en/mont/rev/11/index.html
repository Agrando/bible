"Go and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and those who are worshiping therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But the court which is outside the temple, omit, and do not measure that, for it has been given up to the Gentiles, and they shall tread under foot the Holy City for forty and two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will give power to my two witnesses, and clothed in sackcloth they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When any one wishes to hurt them, fire comes from their mouth and devours their enemies; and if any man wishes to hurt them, in this manner he must be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These have power to shut heaven so that it does not rain in the days of their prophecy; and have power over waters to turn them to blood,  and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that is coming up out of the bottomless pit will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And their dead bodies lie in the streets of the great city whose mystical name is Sodom and Egypt - where also their Lord was crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For three days and a half men of all peoples, and tribes, and languages, and nations, look upon their dead bodies, and refuse to let their dead bodies be laid in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"And those who dwell on the earth are rejoicing over them, and making merry; and they will send gifts to one another; because these two prophets were a torment to those who dwell on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, "Come up hither," and they went up to heaven on a cloud, while their enemies watched them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons; and the rest were frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"The second woe is passed; and there is a third woe soon to follow."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the seventh angel blew his trumpet; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, "THE KINGDOMS OF THIS WORLD ARE BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD AND OF HIS CHRIST, AND HE WILL REIGN FOREVER AND EVER."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the four and twenty Elders who are seated before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshiped God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying. "We give thee thanks, O Lord God, The Almighty, who art and who wast; For thou hast taken thy great power, And begun to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The nations raged, and thy wrath came, And the time for the dead to be judged; The time for rewarding thy slaves, the prophets And the saints, and those who reverence thy name, Both small and great; And the time to destroy those who are destroying the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen inside his sanctuary; and there followed lightnings and voices and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
