These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. I know your works, that you have the name of being alive, but are really dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Be continually on the watch, and establish the things that remain,  which were ready to die. For I have not found your works perfected before my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Call to mind, then, what you have received and heard, and hold to it, and repent. Unless you are on the watch, I will come as a thief,  and you will never know at what hour I am coming upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet you have a few names in Sardis that have not defiled their garment; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who overcomes shall thus be clad in white raiment; and I will in no wise blot out his name from the book of life, and I will own his name before my Father, and before his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let him who has an ear, listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Write also to the angel of the Church in Philadelphia. These things says He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens, and no one shall shut; and who shuts, and no one opens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I know your works. Lo, I have set before you an open door, which none can shut; for though you have only a little strength, you have kept my word, and have not denied my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, I am making those of the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews, but are not, but are lying; behold, I will make them to come and bow in reverence before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from that hour of trial which is about to come upon the whole inhabited earth, to test those who dwell on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am coming quickly. Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God;  and he shall go out from it nevermore. And I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He that has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>To the angel of the Church in Laodicea, write. These things says the Amen, the witness, faithful and true, the beginning of the creation of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I know your works, that you are neither hot nor cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Would that you were either cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm,  and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you keep saying, "I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing," and do not know that you are the wretched one, and pitiable and beggared and blind and naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I advise you to buy of me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white raiment to clothe yourself, so that the shame of your nakedness may not be made manifest; and eye-salve to anoint your eyes, in order that you may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All whom I love I reprove and discipline; therefore be full of zeal and repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, I am standing at the door and knocking! If any one listens to my voice, and opens the door, I will come to him, and sup with him, and he with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>To him who overcomes, I will grant to sit down with me on my throne,  as I myself have overcome and have taken my seat with my Father on his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let any one who has an ear listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
