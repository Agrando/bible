Grace to you, and peace from Him that is and was and is to be, and from the Seven Spirits that are before his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has loosed us from our sins in his own blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and has made us to be a kingdom of priests unto his God and Father;  to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever, Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, he is about to come among the clouds; and every eye will see him, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him.
