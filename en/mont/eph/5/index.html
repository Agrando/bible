Such words become you not, but rather thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For be well assured that no one guilty of fornication or impurity or covetousness which is idolatry, has any heritage in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let no man deceive you with empty arguments, for it is these vices that bring down the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>therefore do not become sharers with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For you were once darkness, but are now in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lead the life of children of light, for the fruit of the light consists in every kind of goodness and uprightness and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Examine carefully what is well pleasing to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of the darkness,  but rather expose them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is a shame even to speak of the things that are done by such men in secret;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but all these things, when exposed, are by the light made manifest,  and what is made manifest is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this reason it is said, "Awake, thou sleeper! Arise from the dead; And Christ shall shine upon thee!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See to it, then, that you carry on your life carefully; not as foolish, but as wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Buy up opportunity, for the times are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this reason do not be thoughtless, but learn to know what the Lords will is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not be drunk with wine, in which is riotous living, but drink deep in the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>when you talk together; with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,  singing and with all your hearts making music unto the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and at all times for all things give thanks to God, the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Submit yourselves one to another out of reverence for Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives likewise to their husbands as to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>because a husband is the head of his wife even as Christ is head of the church, his body, which he saves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But as the church submits itself to Christ, so also wives to their husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in order that after cleansing her in the bath of baptism, he might sanctify her by his word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>so as to present her to himself, the church glorified, without spot or wrinkle or any such blemish; but on the contrary holy and faultless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>That is how husbands ought to love their wives, as they love their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it as Christ does the church;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for we are members of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>There is a deep mystery here - I am speaking of Christ and his church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But as for you individually, you must each one of you love his own wife exactly as if she were yourself; and the wife, on her part,  should reverence her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
