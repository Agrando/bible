"Do not be terrified! You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified? He is risen; he is not here. See, the place where they laid him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, "He is going before you into Galilee, where you will see him, as he told you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they went out, and ran from the tomb, for they were trembling and amazed; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now after his resurrection, early on the first day of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they, although they heard that he was living and had been seen by her did not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this he appeared in another form to two of them as they were walking on their way into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They too went, and told the others; but they did not believe them,  either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterward he appeared to the Eleven themselves, as they were eating,  and reproached them for their lack of faith, and stubborn hearts,  because they disbelieved those who had seen him risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them. "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who disbelieves shall be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover these signs shall follow those who believe. They shall drive out demons in my name; they shall speak with new tongues in foreign languages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they shall pick up serpents, and if they drink any poison it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the message by the miracles which followed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
