In the desert make ready a road for the Lord. Make his paths straight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In the desert came Johnwho baptized, and preached a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and all the land of Judea, and all the people of Jerusalem, kept going out to him, and were baptized by him in the Jordan river,  confessing their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Johnwas clothed with camels hair, and he had a leather girdle round his loins, and he ate locusts, and "honey of the wood."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He made proclamation. "There is One mightier than I coming after me,  and I am not worthy to stoop down and unfasten his sandal strap;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I have baptized you in water, but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It was at that time that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by Johnin the Jordan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and as soon as he rose from the water he saw the sky cleft asunder,  and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and a voice from the sky. "Thou art my Son, my beloved; in thee is my delight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Spirit drove him at once into the desert,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he remained in the desert for forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was among the wild beasts, but the angels were ministering to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After Johnhad been thrown into prison Jesus came into Galilee preaching the gospel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"The time is now come," he said, "and the kingdom of God is near!  Repent and believe the gospel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as he was passing along by the sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew, Simons brother, casting their net into the sea, for they were fishermen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At once they left their nets and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As he went a little farther on he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and Johnhis brother, who also were in their boat mending the nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Straightway he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they came to Capernaum, and as soon as the Sabbath Day came he went into the synagogue and began to teach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them with authority, not like the Scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And at that very moment, there in their synagogue, a man in the grip of an unclean spirit shrieked out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"What business have you with us, you Jesus of Nazareth? Are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus rebuked him, saying. "Be quit! Come out of him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the unclean spirit, after tearing him, came out of him with a loud cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and every one was amazed so that they began questioning among themselves. "What does this mean? A new teaching with authority? He lays commands even upon unclean spirits and they obey him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And at once his fame spread everywhere through that part of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>On leaving the synagogue they went at once with Jamesand Johnto the house of Simon and Andrew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Simons mother-in-law lay sick of fever, and without delay they told him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So he came and took her hand and raised her up. The fever left her at once, and she began to wait upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>At evening when the sun had set, people came and brought to him all the sick and demon-possessed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the whole town was gathered at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He cured many who were ill with various diseases, and drove out many demons. But he did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In the morning he rose a great while before day and went out to a desert place, and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and his companions hunted him up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and told him, "Every one is looking for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"Let us go away," he answered, "to the neighboring country towns,  that I may preach there, too; because for that purpose I came forth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and driving out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One day a leper cane to him and besought him as he knelt down to him, saying, "If you choose, you are able to cleanse me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus, moved with compassion, put out his hand and touched him,  saying, "I do choose, be clean!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The leprosy at once left him, and he was made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus immediately sent him away, charging him sternly and saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"See you say nothing to any one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your purification what Moses commanded for a testimony to them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out and began to tell every one and to publish it broadcast, so that Jesus could no longer enter any town openly; but he had to remain outside in lonely places, and people kept coming to him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
