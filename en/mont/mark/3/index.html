"Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath Day, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They were silent. Then looking around upon them with anger, and deeply grieved by the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man,  "Stretch out your hand!" He stretched it out, and the hand was at once completely restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As soon as they came out, the Pharisees plotted against him with the Herodians, in order to destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples; and a great crowd of people from Galilee followed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>From Judea, too, and Jerusalem, and Idumea, and from beyond Jordan,  and from the district of Tyre and Sidon, they came to him a vast multitude, because they heard what he was doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So he directed his disciples to keep a little boat in readiness for him, because of the crowd, to prevent their crushing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he had healed so many that all the people who had ailments pressed upon him so as to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him, they threw themselves down at his feet, screaming out, "You are the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But over and over, he strictly forbade them to make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he went up the hillside and called to him those whom he chose,  and they came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Twelve of them whom he also called "Apostles," he appointed to be with him, and also that he might send them out to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to cast out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There was Simon, whom he surnamed Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and James(them he surnamed Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas,  and Jamesthe son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Zealot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot who betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he went into a house, but again such a multitude assembled that they could not get their food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When his relatives heard of it, they came to take possession of him,  for they said, "He is out of his mind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Scribes also who had come down from Jerusalem, said, "He is Beelzebub," and, "He casts out demons by the power of the Prince of the demons."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So when he had called them to him he spoke to them in parables.  "How," said he, "can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>if a household be divided against itself, that household cannot stand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and if Satan has revolted against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand. Nay, he meets his end!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Indeed, no one can enter the strong mans house and carry off his property without first binding the strong man; then he can plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In solemn truth I tell you that the sons of men shall be forgiven all their sins and all the blasphemies they may utter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit is never forgiven.  Nay, he is in the grasp of an eternal sin."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because they kept saying, "He has an unclean spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then his mother and his brothers came up, and standing outside, they sent a messenger to him to call him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now a crowd was sitting round him and they told him, "See! your mother and your brothers and sisters are outside, wanting to see you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Who are my mother and my brothers?" he replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then, with a glance at those who were in the circle sitting around him, he added.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does the will of God,  that one is my brother and sister and mother."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
