"Moses gave you that command because of the hardness of your hearts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>so that they are no more two, but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When indoors the disciples began to question Jesus again about this,  and he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now people were bringing little children to Jesus for him to touch them; but the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus was indignant when he saw it, and said. "Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them; for the kingdom of God belongs to such.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I tell you true that unless a man receives the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not even enter it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he took them in his arms, and laid his hand upon them in blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As he started to go forth into the road, a man came running up to him, and knelt down before him. "Good Teacher," he asked, "what must I do to inherit eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus said to him. "Why do you call me good?No one is good save one, God himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know the commandments. Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not cheat, honor your father and mother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Teacher," he answered, "I have observed all these from my youth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus loved him as he looked at him, and said. "One thing you lack.  Go, sell all you have and give to the poor; and you shall have wealth in heaven; and come, follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his face fell at these words, and he went away saddened, for he was one who had great wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus looked round on his disciples and said, "How hard it is for those who have wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciples were amazed at his words. Jesus looked around and said again to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"My sons, how hard it is for those who trust in money to enter the kingdom of God. It is easier for a camel to get through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Then who can be saved?" they said to themselves astonished beyond measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he had looked at them, Jesus said, "With men it is impossible,  but not with God, for all things are possible with God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"But we," Peter began to say, "we have left our all and have followed you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"I tell you solemnly," said Jesus, "that there is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake and the gospels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but shall receive a hundred times as much, now in this present world, houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, lands-and persecutions with them - and in the world to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many who are first shall be last, and the last, first."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They were still on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus led the way; and they were amazed, and some, although they followed, were afraid. Then once more he took the Twelve, and began to tell them what was about to befall him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"See," said he, "we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of man will be betrayed to the high priests and the Scribes. They will condemn him to death, and will hand him over to the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>who will mock him, spit upon him, flog him, and put him to death;  and after three days he will rise again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Presently there came up to him Jamesand John, the sons of Zebedee,  and said, "Teacher, we wish you would do for us whatever we ask you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"What is it you want me to do for you?" said he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They answered, "Allow us to sit, one at your right hand, and the other at your left hand, in your glory."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"You know not what you are asking," said Jesus. "Can you drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered him, "We can." "You shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism that I am baptized with shall you be baptized,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but a seat upon my right hand or my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been reserved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When they heard this the ten began to be indignant at Jamesand John,  so Jesus called them to him and said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"You know that those who are regarded as rulers among the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones make them feel their authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Not so shall it be among you. On the contrary whoever would become great among you shall be your servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever among you would be first, shall be slave of all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and justly, for even the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life, a ransom for many."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then they reached Jericho; and as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimeus, the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting beside the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began shouting and saying,  "Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and many kept rebuking him and telling him to be quiet, but he only shouted much louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then Jesus stood still, saying, "Call him." So they called the blind man,and said, "Courage, rise, he is calling you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>The man threw off his cloak, sprang to his feet, and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"What do you want me to do?" said Jesus, addressing him. And the blind man answered, "O Rabboni, that I might receive my sight!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>"Go," said Jesus, "your own faith has saved you," and immediately he received his sight, and began to follow Jesus along the road.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
