"Where did he get all this?"  they asked; "What is the wisdom that is given to this man, and miracles such as these that happen at his hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of Jamesand Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So they disapproved of him. Then Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his native land and among his relatives and in his home."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he was unable to do any miracle there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he wondered at their lack of faith. So he went among the neighboring villages, teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then summoning the Twelve to him, he began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He bade them take nothing but a staff for their journey; no bread,  no wallet, no coins in their purse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>they were to wear sandals, but not to put on two tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Wherever you enter a house," he told them, "remain there until you leave the place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and if any place does not receive you, or listen to you, as you go out of it shake off the dust under your feet, as a warning to them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they fared forth and summoned men to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They cast out many demons, and anointed many sick people with oil and cured them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>King Herod heard it, for the name of Jesus had become well known,  People were saying, "Johnthe Baptist is risen from the dead, and on that account these powers are working in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"He is Elijah," said others. And still others were saying, "He is a prophet, like one of the old prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard, he said, "That Johnwhom I beheaded has come back to life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now this Herod had sent and arrested John, and bound him in prison,  for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philips wife, whom he had married.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Johnhad often told Herod, "It is not right for you to live with your brothers wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Herodias hated him, and wished to put him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but she could not, for Herod was afraid of Johnbecause he knew that he was a just and holy man. So he kept him safe. When he listened to Johnhe was much exercised, yet he found pleasure in listening to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then came a convenient day, when Herod on his birthday held a feast for his lords and generals and the leading men of Galilee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>at which the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced. She charmed Herod and his guests. "Ask me whatever you want," said the king to the young girl, "and I will give it to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He even swore to her that whatever she asked, he would give it to her, up to half his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So she came out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask for?" "The head of Johnthe Baptist," she replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So she at once hurried in to the king and made her request, "I want you," she said, "to give me, without delay, the head of Johnthe Baptist on a charger."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the king was exceedingly sorry; yet on account of his oaths and his guests he was unwilling to disappoint her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he sent at once a soldier of the guard with orders to bring his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went and beheaded Johnin prison, brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young girl, and she gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When Johns disciples heard of this, they came, and took his body,  and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When the apostles had come back to Jesus, they told him all the things they had done, and all they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he said to them, "Come apart, yourselves, to a quiet spot, and rest a while." For there were many coming and going, and they could not get time even to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they sailed away privately to a solitary place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>However, many saw them going, and recognized them, and ran together by land from all the neighboring towns, and arrived there first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So when Jesus landed he saw a vast multitude, and he was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd,  and he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him and said. "This place is desert, and the day is now far spent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Send the people away so that they may go to the farms and villages about here, and buy themselves something to eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In answer he said to them, "You yourselves are to give them food."  "Are we to go and buy fifty dollars worth of bread," they said, "and give them food?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"How many loaves have you?" he answered. "Go and see." When they had found out, they said, "Five, and two fishes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he directed them to make all sit down by companies on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they sat down like beds in a garden, by hundreds and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven he blessed, broke the loaves in pieces, and kept giving to the disciples to distribute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The two fish also he divided to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>All ate and had enough; and they carried away broken fragments of bread and of fish, enough to fill twelve baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Those who ate the bread were five thousand adult men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he at once compelled the disciples to embark in the boat and go before him to Bethsaida on the other side, while he sent the people away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>After he had taken leave of them, he went away into the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when evening came, the boat was half-way across the sea, while he was on shore alone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>but when he saw them distressed in rowing (for the wind was against them), about the fourth watch of the night he went to them, walking upon the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>they thought it was an apparition and shrieked aloud, for they all saw him and were terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But he at once spoke with them, saying. "Courage! It is I. Do not be afraid!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then he got into the boat beside them, and the wind ceased, and they were utterly astounded,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for they had not understood about the loaves; on the contrary their heart was hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When they had crossed over they landed at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>As soon as they got out of the boat, the people at once recognized him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and began running over that whole country, and carrying the sick about on their beds, wherever they heard he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And whenever he entered into villages or cities or the fields they would lay the sick in the market-places and beseech him to let them touch even the tassel of his cloak, and all who touched him were made well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
