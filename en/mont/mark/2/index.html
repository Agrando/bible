He blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins but One, God himself?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus clearly perceived at once be the Spirit that they were thus reasoning in their hearts and said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Why do you reason thus in your hearts? Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise, take up your cot and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But to let you see that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins" -he said to the paralytic-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I bid you rise, take up your cot, and go home."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The man rose, at once took up his cot, and went out before them all;  at which they were all astounded, and gave God glory, saying, "We never saw anything like this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus went again to the seaside, and the whole crowd kept coming to him, and he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As he was passing by he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax-office; and he said to him, "Follow me." So he rose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Later on Levi was sitting at table in his house, and together with Jesus and his disciples a number of tax-gatherers and sinners were guests, for there were many of them who used to follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when some scribes of the Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax-gatherers, they said to his disciples, "Is he eating and drinking with tax-gatherers and sinners?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On hearing this Jesus said to them. "It is not the healthy who need a physician, but the sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the disciples of Johnand the Pharisees were keeping a fast, and people came to ask him, "How is it that the disciples of Johnand the Pharisees are fasting, but your disciples are not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Can friends of the bridegroom fast while he is still with them?"  asked Jesus. "As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the days will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them; then, on that day, they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No one ever sews a piece of unshrunk cloth onto an old garment,  otherwise the patch tears away from it - the new from the old - and a worse tear is made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no one ever pours new wine into old wine-skins, else the wine would burst the skins, and both wine and skins would be lost. New wine is poured into fresh wine-skins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One Sabbath he was walking along through the wheat-fields, and his disciples, as they began to make their way across, were pulling the heads of wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Look," said the Pharisees to him, "Why are they doing on the Sabbath Day what is against the law?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered them. "Have you never read what David did when he was needy and hungry, he and his men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How he went into the house of God when Abiathar was priest, and ate the consecrated bread, which none but priests may eat, and gave some to his men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"The Sabbath," he told them, "was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so the Son of man is Master even of the Sabbath."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
