There shall not be left here one stone upon another which shall not be thrown down," he answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When he had seated himself on the Mount of Olives, facing the Temple, Peter and Jamesand Johnand Andrew asked him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Tell us when these things shall be, and what shall be the sign that all these predictions are about to be fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Jesus began to tell them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Be ye watchful lest any one mislead you. Many will come in my name,  saying, I am he, and will mislead many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be dismayed,  such things must come, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation shall rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines;  these are the beginning of birth-pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"You yourselves must be on your guard. They will hand you over to the courts, and you will be flogged on the synagogues; and you will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, to witness to them for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When, however, they are leading you all to trial, do not worry beforehand about what you are to say, but whatever is given you in that hour, that say, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"And brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child,  and children will rise up against their parents, and have them put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You will be hated by all men for my names sake, but he that endures to the end shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"But when you see the Abomination of Desolation standing where he ought not (let the reader ponder this), then let those in Judea flee to the mountains;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor go in to get anything out of his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he who is in the field, let him not turn back to get his cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And alas for the pregnant women, and for those that are nursing their infants in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray that it may not come in the winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For those will be days of suffering the like of which has never been from the beginning of Gods creation until now, and never shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And had not the Lord cut short those days, not a single person would escape; but for the elects sake whom he has chosen, he has cut them short.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"At that time if any one tell you, See, here is Christ, or See,  there he is, do not believe it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show signs and wonders, to lead astray the very chosen, if they can.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be on your guard! I have told you it all beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"But when the tribulation is past, in those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shed her light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then will they see the Son of man coming in clouds, with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he will send forth the angels and gather his chosen from the four winds, from uttermost earth to uttermost sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"From the fig tree learn now her parable; as soon as ever her branches are full of sap and bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So also do you, whenever you see these things happening, know that He is near, at your very door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I tell you truly that the present generation shall not pass until all these things begin to happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Earth and sky shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But concerning that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>nor the Son, but only the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Take heed! Awake! for you never know the time. As a man gone abroad and leaving his house gives authority to his slaves, to each his task;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and orders the porter to keep watch; keep watch then, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming - in the evening, at midnight, at cockcrow, or in the morning -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>lest he should come unexpectedly and find you sleeping;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and what I say to you, I say to all. Be awake and on guard."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
