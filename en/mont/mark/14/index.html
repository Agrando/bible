Both the chief priests and the Scribes were continually seeking how they might arrest him by a stratagem and kill him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>but, "Not on a feast-day," they said, "for fear there should be a riot among the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And while he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the Leper, while he was dining, a woman came with an alabaster vase of very costly,  pure spikenard perfume, and, breaking the vase, she poured the perfume on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Some of those who were present said among themselves indignantly.  "Why has the perfume been wasted like this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That perfume could have been sold for more than one hundred and fifty dollars, and given to the poor."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they began upbraiding her, but Jesus said. "Let her alone. Why are you troubling her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>She has done a beautiful thing to me. For you always have the poor among you, and can show them kindness whenever you wish, but me you will not always have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has done what she could. she has before time anointed my body for my burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I tell you in solemn truth that wherever the gospel is preached throughout the whole world, there what she has done shall be told in remembrance of her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve, went away to the high priests to betray Jesus to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they were glad when they heard it, and promised to pay him money. So he kept looking for an opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, the day for killing the paschal lamb, his disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparation for you to eat the Passover?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he sent two of his disciples, and told them. "Go into the city,  and you will meet a man carrying a jar of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Follow him; and whatever house he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks, "Where is your guest-chamber, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He will himself show you a large, upper room, furnished and ready.  there make preparation for us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the disciples went off, and came into the city, and found everything as he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they made ready the Passover, and as night fell he came, with the Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While they were at the table, eating, Jesus said solemnly. "It is one of you who will betray me - one who is eating with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They began to be sorrowful and to say to him, one after another,  "Surely, not I?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"It is one of the Twelve," said Jesus, "one who is dipping into the same dish with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the Son of man is going his way, as the Scripture says, but woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It were good for that man if he had never been born."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as they were eating he took bread, and after the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, "Take it, this is my body."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he said. "This is my covenant blood, which is poured out for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Solemnly I tell you I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine,  until that day I drink it new in the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus said to them. "All of you are about to stumble, for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"But after my resurrection I will go before you into Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Although they all stumble and fall, yet will not I," answered Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said to him, "I tell you in solemn truth that you yourself,  today on this very night, before the cock crow twice, shall three times disown me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Peter kept protesting passionately, "Though I must die with you,  I will not disown you!" And they all kept saying the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they came to a place named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit down here while I pray."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then he took Peter and Jamesand Johnwith him, and began to be full of terror and distress;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and he said to them. "My soul is full of anguish, even unto death;  wait here, and keep watch."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So he went a little farther, and throwing himself upon the ground,  he prayed repeatedly that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Abba, Father," he said, "all things are possible with thee. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I will, but what thou wilt."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he came and found them asleep, and he said to Peter. "Are you sleeping, Simon? Could you not keep watch one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Keep watch, all of you, and pray that you may not come into temptation; the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he went away again and prayed, saying the same words;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and when he returned he found them once more asleep, for their eyes were heavy with sleep, and they knew not what to say to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he came the third time, and said. "Sleep on now, and take your rest! It is over. My hour is come. Look! the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Rouse yourselves, let us go. See! my betrayer is at hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>At that instant, while he was yet speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, came up, and with him a mob armed with swords and clubs, sent by the high priests and Scribes and elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now the betrayer had given them a sign. "The one I kiss," he said,  "is the man. Arrest him, and take him away safely."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So he came and going straight up to Jesus he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"Rabbi," and kissed him. Then they laid hands on him and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But one of the bystanders drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus interposed, saying. "Are you come out to arrest me with swords and clubs, as if I were a robber?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Day after day I was face to face with you in the Temple courts,  teaching, and you did not seize me. But this is done that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then they all forsook him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>One young man, however, began following him, with only a linen sheet thrown round his naked body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They seized him, but he left the linen sheet and fled away naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then they took Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and Scribes came with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Peter also had followed Jesus at a distance, until he was inside the court of the high priest. There he was sitting among the officers,  warming himself in the light of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Meanwhile the high priests and all of the Sanhedrin were trying to get evidence against Jesus, so as to have him put to death, but they found none;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>for though many gave false witness against him, their testimony did not agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Some came forward and swore falsely, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>"We heard him say, I will tear down this temple made by hands, and in three days I will build another temple not made by hands."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>But even their evidence did not agree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Then the high priest rose and stood forth among them. "Have you no answer to make?" he asked Jesus; "What is it that these testify against you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he remained silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned him. "Are you the Christ," he said, "the Son of the Blessed?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>"I am," Jesus answered, "and you all shall see the Son of man seated on the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the high priest tore his vestments. "Why do we need any further witness?" he exclaimed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>"Did you hear his blasphemy? What is your verdict?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then they all condemn him to be worthy of death. Some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him while striking him and saying,  "Prophesy." The officers, too, received him into custody with blows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, there came one of the maid servants of the high priest, and saw Peter warming himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>She looked at him, and said, "You too were with the Nazarene, Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied it. He said. "I dont know, I dont understand what you are saying." Then he went out into the porch, and the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Again the maid servant saw him, and began again to tell the bystanders, "He is one of them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>A second time he continued to deny it. After a little the by-  standers began to say to Peter again, "Surely you are one of them,  for you are a Galilean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>But he began with curses an solemn oaths to say, "I do not know the man you are talking about."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>At that instant for the second time a cock crew. Then Peter recalled the word which Jesus had spoken to him, "Before the cock crows twice you will disown me thrice." And as he thought of it, he began to weep aloud.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
