"Why do your disciples not follow the traditions of the elders? Why do they eat with common  unwashed hands?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, hypocrites," he answered. "As it is written, "This people honor me with their lips, While their hearts are far from me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But in vain do they worship me, For their teaching is only human precepts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"You neglect the commandment of God, and hold fast the traditions of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"It is praiseworthy, is it," he exclaimed, "to reject the command of God that you may keep your tradition!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For although Moses said, Honor your father and mother, and Let him who curses father or mother suffer death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>you say that if a man tells his father or mother, This money which otherwise you would have received from me, is Korban (that is, a thing devoted to God),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>you exempt him from doing any service for his father or mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus by your tradition which you have handed down you set at naught the word of God; and you do many other things like that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then again he called the crowd to him and said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Listen to me, all of you, and understand; there is nothing outside a man which by entering in can defile him; but it is what comes from him that defiled him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After he had left the crowd and gone indoors his disciples began asking him about the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Are even you without understanding?" he said. "Do you not perceive that nothing whatever from without can defile a man by entering him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because it does not go into his heart, but into his belly, and passes away, ejected from him?" By these words he pronounced all foods clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"What comes out of a man," he continued, "is what defiles him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From within, from the heart of man, proceed evil purposes -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>fornication, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit,  wantonness, envy, slander, arrogance, reckless folly -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>all these wicked things issue from within and defile a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After he rose and left that place, he went away into the region of Tyre and Sidon. Here he went into a house and wished no one to know it but he could not be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Forthwith a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(the woman was a Greek, a Syro-phoenician by race), and again and again she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Let the children be filled first," he said to her. "It is unseemly to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"True, Master," she answered, "but the dogs under the table do pick up the childrens crumbs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"For that saying of yours, go home," he replied; "the demon has departed from your daughter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So she went home, and found the child lying in her bed and the demon departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Again he left the region of Tyre, and passed through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, crossing the District of the Ten Towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they brought to him a deaf man who stammered, and begged him to lay his hands upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So Jesus took him aside from the crowd, by himself, and put his finger in the mans ears, and moistened his tongue with saliva;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>then looking up to heaven with a sigh, he said to him, "Ephphatha!"  (that is, "Be opened.")</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his ears were opened and the bond of his tongue was loosened,  and he spoke plainly. Then Jesus charged them not to tell any one,  but the more he charged them, the more they published it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and people were amazed beyond measure saying. "How successfully he does things! Even the deaf he makes to hear, and the dumb to speak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>missing fehlt/missing</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
