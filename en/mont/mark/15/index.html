In reply Jesus said, "It is as you say."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When the chief priests continued making many accusations against him, Pilate repeatedly questioned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Do you make no answer?" he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"See, how many accusations they are making." But Jesus no longer made any answer, at which Pilate wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now at the time of the feast it was customary to release to them a prisoner, whatever one they asked for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A man named Barabbas was there in prison, with some rioters who had committed murder during an uprising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So when the crowd went up and began asking Pilate to follow his usual custom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>he asked them, "Do you wish me to release the King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he recognized that it was through spite that the high priests had handed him over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests incited the crowds to have Barabbas released to them, instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Pilate spoke to them once more, "What them shall I do to him you call King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they shouted again, "Crucify him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Why, what wrong has he done?" Pilate kept saying. But they shouted furiously, "Crucify him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Pilate, who wished to make himself strong with the crowd,  released Barabbas to them, and gave Jesus over for crucifixion, after he had scourged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The soldiers then led him away into the courtyard (Praetorium), and called together the whole battalion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They clothed Jesus in purple, and plaited a crown of thorns, and placed it on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they began to salute him. "Hail, King of the Jews," they said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They kept striking him on the head with a rod, and spitting upon him; and on bended knee they did him homage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And after their sport with him, they stripped off the purple robe,  and put on his own clothes, and led him out to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Simon a Cyrenian, a passer-by, who was coming from the country (the father of Alexander and Rufus), they commandeered to carry the cross of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they led him to the place called Golgotha - a name which means "the place of a skull."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>There they attempted to give him wine mingled with myrrh; but he refused it. Then they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots upon them to see what each should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It was nine oclock in the morning when they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Over his head there was written the words of the charge against him.  "The King of the Jews"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right hand and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the passers-by kept jeering at him, wagging their heads and saying. "Ah! you who were to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days, save yourself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come down from the cross!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In the same way the high priests also, as well as the Scribes, kept on mocking him to themselves. "He saved others," they said, "but himself he cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The Christ! The King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe." They also who had been crucified with Jesus kept reviling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At noon a darkness came over the whole country, lasting until three in the afternoon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>At three oclock Jesus cried in a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they heard this, some of the bystanders said, "Listen, he is calling for Elijah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then a man ran and filled a sponge full of sour wine, and put it on a stick, and offered it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Jesus uttered a loud cry and expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the curtain of the Sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then the army captain, who was standing facing Jesus when he thus died, said, "in truth this man was a Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There were some women also watching from a distance. Among them were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Jamesthe younger and of Joses, and Salome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>women who used to follow him when he was in Galilee, and minister to him; and many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Toward sunset, as it was the preparation (that is the day preceding the Sabbath),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>there came Joseph of Arimathea, a Councilor, honorable in rank, who was himself also looking for the kingdom of God. He boldly went in to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But Pilate wondered whether he were already dead. So he summoned the army captain, and inquired if he had been any time dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and when he learned the fact from the army captain he gave the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So Joseph bought him a sheet, and took Jesus down, wound him in the sheet, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock, and then rolled a stone against the opening of the tomb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses were watching to see where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
