Moreover, some of them are from a distance."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Where will it be possible," answered his disciples, "for one to fill these men with bread in a lonely place like this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He asked them, "How many loaves have you?" "Seven," they said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground; and when he had taken the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke them, and gave to his disciples to distribute to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They had also a few small fish; after blessing these he told his disciples to distribute them also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They ate and were filled and they took up of broken pieces that were left, seven hampers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They that had eaten were about four thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he sent them away, got at once into the boat with his disciples. and came into the district of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, by way of testing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At this Jesus sighed deeply in his spirit, and said. "Why does the present generation seek a sign? In solemn truth I tell you that no sign shall be given this generation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he left them, and getting into the boat again, went away to the other side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now they had forgotten to take bread, and had not in the boat with them more than one loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he gave them this warning. "Look out! Be on the watch against the leaven of the Pharisees, and the leaven of Herod."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they began arguing with one another because they had no bread,  He noted this and said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Why are you arguing together because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive and understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Are your minds so slow to comprehend? You have eyes, do you not see?  You have ears, do you not hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do you not remember? When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets of broken pieces did you take up?"  "Twelve," they said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"And when the seven for the four thousand, how many hampers full of fragments did you pick up?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Do you not yet understand?" he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then they came to Bethsaida, where some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and begged him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Taking the blind man by the hand, he led him outside the village;  and, after spitting on his eyes, he laid his hands on him and asked,  "Can you make out anything?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The man looked up and said, "I can make out the people, for as they move about, I see them like trees."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jesus again put his hands on the mans eyes; and the man,  staring straight ahead, recovered his sight and continued to see everything perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Jesus sent him home, saying, "Do not even go into the village."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>From there Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the way he began to question his disciples saying,  "Who do people say I am?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they told him. "Some say Johnthe Baptist, others, Elijah, and others that you are one of the prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he continued questioning them, "But you yourselves, Who do you say I am?" Peter in reply said to him, "You are Christ."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he strictly charged them not to say this about him to any one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he began to explain to them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests, and the Scribes, and be put to death,and after two days rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This he told them quite openly. Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he turned round, and looked upon his disciples, and rebuked Peter. "Get thee behind me, Satan," he said, "for your thoughts are not Gods thoughts, but mans."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then summoning the crowd to him, with his disciples. he said. "If any man wishes to follow me, let him renounce self, take up his cross, and so follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever, for my sake and the gospels, loses his life will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Or what shall a man give in exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this unfaithful and wicked generation, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
