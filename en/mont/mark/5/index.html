"Jesus, son of God most high, what business have you with me? I adjure you by God,  torment me not!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For Jesus was saying, "Foul spirit, come out of the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He continued asking him, "What is your mane?" "Legion is my name,  for we are many."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Over and over he continued to beg Jesus not to send them away out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there was on the hillside a great drove of swine feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the spirits begged him, saying, "Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gave them leave. And out came the foul spirits and entered the swine; and the drove rushed down from the steep into the sea, in number about two thousand, and were choked in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>On this the swineherds ran away and spread the news in town and country. So the people went to see what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When they got to Jesus they found the demoniac sitting there clothed and in his right mind - the man who had had the "Legion" - and they were awestruck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those who had been eye-witnesses told them what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they began to beg Jesus to depart from their district.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging to go with him; but he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Go home to your own people, and tell them what great things God has done for you, and has had mercy upon you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So he went and began to publish abroad in the District of the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and every one was astonished and all men marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then after Jesus had recrossed in a boat to the other side, a vast multitude came crowding around him; so he stayed on the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then one of the wardens of the synagogue, named Jairus, came up, and as soon as he saw Jesus, fell at his feet, with many entreaties,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"My little daughter," he said, "is dying. I beseech you, come and lay your hands on her, that she may recover and live."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he went with him, and a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there was a woman who had had a hemorrhage for twelve years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, but was no better; on the contrary, rather grew worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She had heard about Jesus, so she came in the crowd behind and touched his cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"If I can touch even his clothes," she kept saying to herself, "I shall get well."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At once the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was cured of her complaint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus, instantly conscious that the power within him had gone forth,  turned about in the crowd, and said, "Who touched my clothes?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"You see the crowd thronging about you," said his disciples, "and yet you say, Who touched me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he kept looking about to see who had done it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the woman knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling, and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Daughter," he said, "your faith has saved you. Go in peace, and be cured of your complaint."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While he was still speaking men came from the house of the warden of the synagogue to tell him, "Your daughter is dead, why trouble the Teacher any further?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But Jesus, paying no attention to the remark, said to the warden of the synagogue, "Have no fear, only believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He would not permit any one to go with him, except Peter and Jamesand John, the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As they came to the house of the warden of the synagogue, he gazed upon a tumult, many weeping and wailing shrilly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"Why all this tumult and loud weeping?" he asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"The child is not dead, but asleep." And they began to laugh him to scorn. Then he put them all outside, took the father and mother of the child and those he brought with him, and entered the room where the child was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he took the childs hand and said to her, "Talitha, cumi," that is to say, "Little girl, I am speaking to you; arise!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And instantly the little girl stood up, and began to walk, for she was twelve years old, They were at once beside themselves with utter amazement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He, however, repeatedly cautioned them not to let any one know about it, and directed them to give her something to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
