"There was once a man," he said, "who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a pit for the wine-press, built a tower, rented it to tenants, and went abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>At vintage-time he sent a slave to the vine-dressers to collect some of the proceeds of the vineyard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but they seized him, and flogged him, and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then he sent another slave to them; and this man they knocked over the head and handled shamefully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he sent another; and him they killed; and many others; beating some, and killing some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He had still one, a Son beloved, He sent him last to them, saying,  "They will reverence my Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"But those tenants said to themselves. Here is the heir! Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"So they took him and killed him, and threw his body out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What will the owner of the Vineyard do?" "He will come and put the tenants to death," they said, "and will give the vineyard to others."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Have you not read this Scripture?" (he continued) "The very stone which the builders rejected Has now become the corner-stone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the Lords doing; It is marvelous in our eyes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they kept seeking to lay hold on him, but were afraid of the crowd, for they knew well that he had spoken this parable about them;  so they left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But they sent some of the Pharisees to Jesus afterward, and some of the Herodians to entrap him in conversation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So when they came, they said. "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and are not afraid of any one, for you do not regard the face of men;  nay, but you reach the way of God in truth. Is it right to pay poll-  tax to Caesar or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall we pay, or not pay?" But he, knowing well their hypocrisy,  said to them. "Why are you testing me? Bring me a dollar for me to look at."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they brought it. "Whose likeness and inscription is this?"  "Caesars," they answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus said, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God, the things that are Gods." They were amazed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then came up some Sadducees, men who say there is no resurrection.  They too questioned him, saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Teacher, Moses taught us that if a mans brother die, and leave a wife behind him, but no child, that his brother is to marry the widow and to raise up a family for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There were once seven brothers, the eldest of whom married a wife,  and died leaving no family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The second married her, and died without offspring; the third likewise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the seven had her, and died without issue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And last of all the woman too died. In the resurrection whose wife shall she be? For the seven had her as wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Is not this the reason for your error," Jesus answered them, "that you know not the Scripture nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they rise from the dead men do not marry, and women are not given in marriage, but they are as the angels are in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But in regard to the rising again of the dead, have you never read in the Book of Moses, in the passage about the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying, "I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are in grave error."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Just then up came one of the Scribes who had heard them arguing, and realized that Jesus had answered them admirably. "What commandment,"  he asked, "is the first of all?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus replied. "The first is. "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"The second is this, "Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. Other command greater than these there is none."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"Admirably said, O Teacher," exclaimed the Scribe. "You have truthfully said that He is one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and that beside him there is none other, and to love him with all ones heart and with all ones understanding and with all ones might, and to love ones neighbor as oneself is far beyond all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus saw that he had answered with discrimination, and said to him,  "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that no one ventured to question him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While he was teaching in the Temple courts, Jesus in his turn asked.  "How is it that the Scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>David himself said in the Holy Spirit, "The Lord said to my Lord,  Sit at my right hand until I make thy foes the footstool of thy feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"David himself then calls him Lord; so how can he be his son?" Now the great mass of the people were wont to listen to him with delight;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and in his teaching he said. "Look out for the Scribes who like to walk about in long robes, and to receive salutations in the street,  and to have prominent places in the synagogues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and seats of honor at dinner-parties;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>they who consume the property of widows and make long, pretentious prayers. The greater shall their condemnation be."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Jesus took his seat opposite the treasury and watched the people putting their offerings into the chest. Many rich people were putting in large sums.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There came also a poor widow who dropped in two little coins, worth a cent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>On this he called his disciples to him, and said. "I tell you solemnly that this poor widow has put in more than all who have put their offerings into the treasury;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for they have all put in what they could spare out of their surplus,  but she, out of her penury, has put in all that she possessed, her whole living."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
