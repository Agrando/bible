Weep aloud, howl for the miseries which are about to come upon you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For your riches lie rotting, and your clothing has become moth-eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Your gold and silver are rusted. and their rust will be for a testimony against you, and it will eat your flesh. For you have been storing up fire in these last days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Look! the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you have been keeping back by fraud, are crying aloud! And the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have lived luxuriously on earth, you have taken your pleasure,  you have fattened your hearts for a day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous man unresisting!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be patient, then, brothers, till the coming of the Lord. Behold the farmer who waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it gets the early and the latter rains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So you also must be patient. Stablish your hearts; for the coming of the Lord is at hand!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not make complaints against each other, brothers, lest you yourselves be condemned. Behold the Judge is standing before the very door!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take, my brothers, for an example the suffering and the patience of the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Remember we count those that were stedfast happy. You have heard of the stedfastness of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord with him,  seen how the Lord is full of tenderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Again, above all things, my brothers, swear not at all, neither by the heavens, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. Let your "yes"  be "yes," and your "no," "no," so you will not fall under condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is any one of you in trouble? Let him pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any in good spirits? Let him sing unto his harp. Is any one of you ill? Let him send for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, after anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the prayer of faith will restore the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So confess your sins one to another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. For the fervent prayer of a righteous man is mighty in its working.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My brothers, if any one of you strays from the truth, and some one brings him back,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>let him know that he who brings a sinner back from the error of his ways, saves his soul from death, and hides a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
