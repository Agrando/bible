Do they not come from your passions which are always making war among your bodily members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You continually crave and do not obtain; you are killing and coveting and cannot acquire; you are fighting and at war. You do not have, because you do not ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You continue to ask and do not receive, because you are asking with a wrong purpose, in order to spend it upon your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity to God? Whoever, then, desires to be a friend of the world,  makes himself and enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you suppose that it is in vain that the Scripture says, "The spirit which has its home in us yearns over us unto jealousy?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives more and more grace. therefore it is said, God ever resists the proud; but to the humble he gives grace continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then ever be subject to God, Ever resist the devil and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God And he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands,  you sinners, And purify your hearts, you double-minded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lament and mourn, and weep aloud! Let your laughter be turned into mourning, And your joy into gloom!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves before the Lord, And he will raise you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not be talking against each other, brothers. He who is talking against a brother and condemning his brothers is talking against the Law and condemning the Law. But if you are condemning the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But One is your Lawgiver and Judge - he who is able to save and to destroy. But you, who are you, to be condemning your neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go to now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we shall journey to such a city and spend a year there, and trade and make money,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>when all the time you do not know what will happen on the morrow.  For what is your life? You are but a mist, appearing for a brief time, and then vanishing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You ought instead to say, "If the Lord wills it, we shall live and do this or that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you are glorying in these insolent boastings of yours; all such glorying is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So to him who knows how to do right and does not do it, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
