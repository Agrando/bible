Let every man be swift in hearing, slow in speaking, slow in growing angry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for a mans anger does not further the righteous purpose of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So strip off all filthiness and superfluity of wickedness, and in meekness receive the implanted Word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And become doers of the Word, and not merely hearers, deceiving yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because if any one is a hearer of the Word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in a mirror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for after he has looked carefully at himself, he goes away, and at once forgets what he is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the man who looks closely into the perfect law - the law of liberty - and continues looking, this man will be blessed in his deed because he is not a hearer who forgets, but a doer who does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If a man thinks himself to be religious, and yet does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own religion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and undefiled before our God and Father, to look after orphans and widows in their affliction, and ever to keep himself unspotted from the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
