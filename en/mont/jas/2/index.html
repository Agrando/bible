Do not the rich oppress you and drag you to court?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Are they not blaspheming that glorious Name by which you are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If you are keeping the royal law, which says, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thou dost thyself, you are doing well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If you have the spirit of caste you are committing sin, and are convicted by the Law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if a man keeps the whole of the Law, and yet stumbles in one point, he is guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not Kill. Now if you do not commit adultery, but if you do kill, you have transgressed the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak and act like men who are to be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment is without mercy to the man who has showed no mercy.  but mercy glories in the face of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My brothers, what good is it if any one says that he has faith, if he has no deeds? Can such faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister be naked and in need of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you says to them, "Depart in peace, find warmth and food for yourselves," but at the same time you do not give the necessaries of the body, what good would that do them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In just the same way faith, if it have not deeds, is by itself a lifeless thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Some one indeed may say, "You have faith, and I have deeds." "Then show me your faith," I answer, "apart from any deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that God is one? You do well; even the demons believe,  and they shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But do you want to be convinced, O foolish man, that faith apart from deeds is barren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our ancestor justified by deeds, in that he offered up Isaac, his son, upon the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see how faith was cooperating with deeds, and faith was made perfect by deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Scripture was fulfilled which said, And Abraham believed God, and this was imputed to him as righteousness, and he was called Gods friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see, then, that it is by his deeds a man is justified, and not simply by his faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner was not Rahab, the harlot, justified by her deeds, in the fact that she received the messengers and sent them forth by another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So just as the body without a spirit is dead, so faith is dead without deeds.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
