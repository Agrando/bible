If any man never stumbles in speech, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When we put bits in the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we control their whole body also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Look at the ships too, though they are so large, even when driven by fierce winds they are turned by a very small rudder, wherever the impulse of the helmsman wills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So also the tongue is a small member and makes great boasts. Behold,  how great a forest is set on fire by a little spark!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire; it is a very world of iniquity among our members, defiling the whole body, and setting on fire the wheel of nature, and is itself set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For while every kind of beast and bird, and of reptiles and sea-  creatures are tamable, and actually have been tamed by mankind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>no man can tame the tongue, restless evil that it is, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we continually bless our Lord and Father, and with it we are accustomed to curse men made in the image of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From out of the same mouth pour forth blessings and cursings! My brothers, this ought not to be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does a spring pour forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives; or a grape-vine, figs? No more can salt water yield fresh water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who among you is wise and intelligent? Let him show his deeds by his good life, in the meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, do not be boasting of that, and be false to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Such wisdom is not that which is descending from on high, but is earthly, sensual, demonlike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For wherever jealousy and faction exist, there is confusion and every evil deed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom which comes from on high is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, conciliatory, overflowing with mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without insincerity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is being sown in peace by those who are working peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
