We were hateful, and we hated one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But when the kindness of God our Saviour, And his love toward men shined forth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He saved us, not because of any deeds that we had done in righteousness, But because of his own pity for us. He saved us by that washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In order that being justified by his grace, We might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This saying is trustworthy. On this I want you to firmly insist;  that those who have faith in God must be careful to maintain honest occupations. Such counsels are good and profitable for men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But avoid foolish questionings and genealogies and dissensions and wranglings about the law; for these are unprofitable and empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>After a first and second admonition, refuse a man who is causing divisions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>you may be sure that such a man is perverted and sinning, and is self-condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, join me in Nicopolis as quickly as you can, for I have arranged to winter there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Speed Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos, on their journey diligently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them want nothing, and "let our people learn to devote themselves to honest work to supply the necessities of their teachers," so that they be not unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All who are with us salute you. Salute those who love me in faith.  Grace be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
