They were ever in submission to their own husbands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>thus, for example, Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are daughters of Sarah, if you do what is right, and permit nothing to make you afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In the same way you husbands live with your wives, according to knowledge, honoring your wife as of the weaker sex, yet as an heir with yourself of the grace of life; so that your prayers may not be hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, you should all be harmonious, sympathetic, loving as brothers, tender-hearted, humble-minded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>not paying back evil for evil or abuse for abuse, but on the contrary giving a blessing. Because for this you have been called - to inherit a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who would love life and enjoy happy days, Let him keep his tongue from evil, And his lips from speaking guile;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let him turn from evil and do good, Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears are open to their cry; But the face of the Lord is set against evil-doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet who will harm you if you become zealous for the good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But even if you should suffer in behalf of righteousness, you are happy. Do not be afraid of their terror, neither be troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But consecrate Christ in your hearts, as Lord. Be always in readiness to make and answer to any one who asks you a reason for the hope that is within you, yet with gentleness and reverence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>See that you have a clear conscience, so that, although they speak of you as evil-doers, these libelers of your good Christian lives may be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better that you suffer for doing right, if such be Gods will, than for doing wrong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because Christ also once for all suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but make alive in spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(It was in spirit that he went and preached the Word to the spirits who were in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who in old times had been disobedient, when Gods longsuffering was waiting in the days of Noah, while an ark was building, in which a few persons - eight in number - were saved by water.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Baptism, the counterpart of that, now saves you (not the washing off of the filth of the flesh, but the prayer for a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; to Him angels and authorities and powers have been made subject.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
