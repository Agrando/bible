Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone,  elect, precious, And he who believes on Him shall never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For you, then, that believe, is the preciousness; but for those who do not believe, A stone which the builders rejected, The same has become the head stone of the corner,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense. They stumble over it because they are disobeying Gods word, and to this they were also appointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people, that you may show forth the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>you who once were not a people, but now are the people of God; who were once without mercy, but now you have found mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I beseech you, beloved, as pilgrims and exiles, to abstain from passions of the flesh that war upon your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let your manner of life before the Gentiles be honest; so that,  although they are now slandering you as evil-doers, they may, by beholding your noble conduct, come to glorify God, in the day of visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Submit yourselves, for the Lords sake, to every human authority;  whether it be to the Emperor as supreme ruler,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers and for the encouragement of well-doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For it is the will of God that by well-doing you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Live like free men; and yet do not make your freedom a cloak for misconduct, but be the slaves of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Reverence God. Honor the Emperor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Household slaves, submit yourselves to your masters in all reverence; not only to the kind and gentle, but also to the unreasonable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is an acceptable thing to God, if from a sense of duty to him, a man endures a wrong, even suffering unjustly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what credit is it if, when you are struck for a fault, you take it patiently? But if when you are doing well and suffer for it, you always take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For this is your calling; because Christ also suffered for you,  leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his footsteps;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He committed no sin, Neither was guile found in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He was reviled, and reviled not back. When he suffered he never threatened but always committed his cause to the One who judges rightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He bore our sins in his own body upon the tree, in order that we might become dead to sins, and be alive unto righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were straying like lost sheep, but you are now returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
