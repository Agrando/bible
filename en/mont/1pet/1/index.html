Grace and peace be multiplied to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whose great mercy we have been born anew into a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and into an inheritance imperishable and undefiled and fadeless,  which has been kept in heaven for you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>who, through faith, are continuously guarded by the power of God for a salvation, ready to be revealed in the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Exult in this, though now for a brief moment, if need be, you have suffered many hardships.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>These are in order that the test of your faith, more precious than gold that is perishable and yet is tested by fire, may redound to praise and glory and honor, at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Him you love, though you have never seen him; in him you ever believe, though even now you see him not, and you are rejoicing with joy unspeakable and full of glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>as you continually receive the reward of your faith, even the salvation of your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Concerning this salvation the Prophets who prophesied regarding the grace intended for you, diligently sought and searched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were searching to know to what time, or to what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them kept pointing, when he ever testified beforehand concerning the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It was revealed to them that it was not for themselves, but for you,  that they were ministering the truths which have now been announced to you, by those who preached the gospel to you, through the help of the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven - truths into which angels long to look.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So then brace up your minds, be steady in spirit, and fix your hope firmly in the grace that is coming to you, at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Like obedient children, do not fashion yourselves according to the former passions of your days of ignorance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but become yourselves holy in your whole manner of living, as He who has called you is holy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as the Scripture says, You shall be holy, because I am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And since you call upon him as Father, who impartially judges each one according to his deeds, pass the time of your sojourning here in reverence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you well know that not with perishable things, with silver or gold, were you redeemed from the emptiness of your manner of life,  received by tradition from your ancestors;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with precious blood, like that of a lamb without spot or blemish, even the blood of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He was indeed foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of the times for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Through him you believe in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope are now in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now that by obedience to the truth you have purified your lives for a brotherly love without hypocrisy, you must love one another from your hearts, fervently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For you have been born anew, not of perishable, but of imperishable seed, by the living, lasting word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, All flesh is grass And all its glory like the flower of the grass. The grass fades, The flower falls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the word of the Lord abides forever. And this is the word of the gospel which has been told to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
