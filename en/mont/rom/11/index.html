No indeed. For I also am an Israelite, a son of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God did not cast off his people whom he foreknew. For do you not know what is said in the Scripture about Elijah? how he pleaded with God against Israel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have overthrown thine altars; And now I alone am left, and they seek my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what was the answer of God to him? I have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In the same way also at this time there is a remnant chosen by gift of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if it is by grace, it is no longer of works; or else grace is no more grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? that which Israel has been seeking for, that he has not obtained; but the chosen have obtained it, and the rest have been hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According as it is written, God has given them a spirit of slumber,  Eyes that they should not see, Ears that they should not hear, unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As David says. Let their table be made a snare and a trap, And a stumbling-block and a recompense unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their backs forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I ask then, "Have they stumbled so as to fall?" No indeed; but by their lapse salvation has come unto Gentiles, "to provoke Israel to jealousy."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if their stumbling enriches the world, and their loss enriches the Gentiles, how much more must their fulness do!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For to you who are Gentiles I say that since I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if by any means I might "provoke to jealousy" my kinsmen, and save some among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if their casting out is the reconciliation of the world to God,  what will their restoration be but life out of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now if the first-fruits of the dough Abraham and the Patriarchs are holy, so also is the whole mass their descendants. And if the root of a tree Abraham is holy, so also are the branches his descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Supposing that some of the branches have been broken off, and you,  although you were but a wild olive, have been grafted in among the branches and have become a partaker with them of the fatness of the olive tree, do not glory over the branches;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>or if you are glorying, remember that it is not you who uphold the root, but the root which upholds you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Branches have been broken off," you say, "that I might be grafted in."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>True, through their unbelief they were broken off, and by your faith you stand. Do not be puffed up, but fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Fix your gaze, therefore, on the goodness and the severity of God;  towards those who fell, severity, but towards you, Gods goodness, if you continue stedfast in his goodness; otherwise you, too, will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they also those Jews, if they do not continue in their unbelief,  will be grafted in again; for God is able to graft them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a mere wild olive tree, and have been grafted, contrary to nature, into a fruitful olive tree, how much more shall these, the natural branches, be regrafted into their own olive tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I would not, my brothers, have you ignorant of this hidden truth, for fear that you become wise in your own conceits. that a hardening in part has befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles is come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written. The deliver will come from Zion, He will banish all ungodliness from Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This is my covenant with them, When I shall take away their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In relation to the gospel, the Jews are Gods enemies for your sake;  but in relation to the election, they are dearly loved for their forefathers sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no change of purpose can annul Gods free gift and call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as in times past you were yourselves disobedient to God, but now, thanks to their disobedience, have obtained mercy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>even so they also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God has locked up all in the prison of disobedience, that upon all he may have mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Oh, the depths of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unfathomable are his judgments, and how unsearchable his paths!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counsellor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who has first given to Him, So as to receive payment in return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For of him and through him, and for him, are all things. All glory to him forever and ever! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
