May God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, bless you, and give you peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>First I thank my God, through Jesus Christ, for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed throughout all the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God is my witness, to whom I render holy service in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, how unceasingly I am ever making mention of you in my prayers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>always entreating him that now at length, if such be his will, the way may be made clear for me to come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I am longing so to see you, in order to impart to you some spiritual gift, so that you may be established;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that is, that I with you may be encouraged by you, each of us by the others faith, yours and mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I want you to know, brothers, that many a time I have planned to come to you - though until now I have been hindered - so as to have some harvest-fruit among you also, even as I have among the rest of the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>To Greeks and to barbarians, to the cultured and to the uncultured,  I have a debt to discharge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>FOR I AM PROUD OF THE GOSPEL. IT IS GODS SAVING POWER FOR EVERY ONE WHO BELIEVES. FOR THE JEW FIRST, AND ALSO FOR THE GENTILE.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>FOR IN IT IS BEING REVEALED A RIGHTEOUSNESS WHICH PROCEEDS FROM GOD,  FROM FAITH UNTO FAITH; AS IT IS WRITTEN.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Gods wrath is ever being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who smother the truth by their unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This is so because that which may be known of God is manifest among them; for God has made it manifest to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, even his everlasting power and divinity, has been clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made. So they have no excuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For although they knew God, yet they did not glorify him as God, nor give him thanks; but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless minds were darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they professed to be wise, they became fools,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and exchanged the majesty of the imperishable God for an idol,  graven in the likeness of perishable man, or of birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their own bodies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>because they exchanged the truth of God for an untruth, and worshiped and served the creature, rather than the Creator who is blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That is why God has given them up to passions of dishonor; for on the one hand their women actually changed the natural function of sex into that which is against nature;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and on the other hand their men likewise abandoned the natural use of women, and were ablaze with passion for one another; men with men practising shameless acts and receiving in their own person that recompense of their wrong-doing which necessarily followed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And just as they refused to continue to retain God in their knowledge, so did God cast them out to an outcast mind, to do those things which were indecent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They were overflowing with every kind of iniquity, depravity, greed,  and malice. They were full of envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and malignity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They became whisperers, back-biters, hated of God, insolent,  haughty, boastful. They invented sins. They were disobedient to parents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They were without sense, without faith, without natural affection,  without mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Though they knew well the ordinance of God, that those who practise such vices are worthy of death, they not only continue to do the same, but were even applauding those who practise vice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
