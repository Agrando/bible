Say not in thine heart, "Who shall ascend to heaven?" - that is, to bring Christ down;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nor,"who shall descend into the abyss?" - that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what does it say? The word is near thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart. That is the very word of faith which we preach;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Confess with your mouth "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God actually raised him from the dead, and you will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For with the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Scriptures say, Whoever believes in Him will not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile, because the same Lord Jesus is all over, and is rich unto all who call upon Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for Whoever will call upon the name of the Lord will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then shall thy call upon Him in whom they do not believe? And how are they to believe in One of whom they have never heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how can men preach unless they are sent? As it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring a glad gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And yet they did not all hearken to the good news; for Isaiah said,  Lord, who hath believed our message?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So faith comes from a message heard, and the message comes from the teaching of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I ask, Did they fail to hear? Yes, truly, Their sound has gone out unto all the earth, And their words unto the ends of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses says. I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation; Against a Gentile nation,  void of understanding, will I anger you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Isaiah speaks very boldly, I was found of those who were not seeking me, I was made manifest to those who were not asking for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But to Israel he says, All day long I have been spreading out my hands unto a disobedient and contrary people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
