To his own lord he stands or falls. And stand he will, for his Master has power to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There are some who esteem one day above another; there are others who esteem all days alike; let each other be fully persuaded in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who regards the day, regards it unto his Lord; and he who regards it not, disregards it unto his Lord. He who eats meat, eats unto his Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who abstains, abstains unto his Lord, since he, too, gives God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For not one of us lives unto himself, and not one dies unto himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If we live, we live unto our Lord; if we die, we die unto our Lord.  So then, whether we live or die, we belong to our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this purpose Christ died and became alive again, that he might be the Lord both of the dead and of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But you the abstainer, why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you again the non-abstainer, why do you despise yours? For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written, "As I live," says the Lord, "to me every knee shall bow, And to God shall every tongue confess."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So let us no longer pass judgment on one another; rather let this be your judgment, that no one put a stumbling-block in his brothers way, nor any cause of falling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is in itself unclean; but any food is "unclean" for one who considers it "unclean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If your brother is continually pained because of your food, you are not conducting yourself any longer in love. Do not, by what you eat,  persist in destroying a man for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore do not let what is right, so far as you are concerned, be evil spoken of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Those who are slaving for Christ devotedly in these ways, are well pleasing to God and highly commended by man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then let is eagerly pursue the things that make for peace and the upbuilding of each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not, for the sake of food, be tearing down Gods work. All food indeed is ceremonially clean, but a man is in the wrong if his food proves a stumbling-block.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The right course is not to eat meat, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything through which your brother is made to stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Have you faith? Keep it to yourself as in the presence of God. He is a happy man who does not condemn himself in that which he approves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who has misgivings, and yet eats meat, is condemned already,  because his action is not based on faith; and whatever is not based on faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
