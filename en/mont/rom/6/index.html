Shall we continue to abound in sin, in order that grace may come to abound?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>No indeed; how shall we who have died to sin still go on living in it any longer?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Jesus Christ, have been baptized into his death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We have been buried together with him, then, through baptism into his death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we should live in a newness of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death,  so we shall also be united with him in the likeness of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this we know, that our old self was crucified with Christ, in order that the slave of sin might be destroyed; so that we should no longer be in slavery to sin -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for he who is dead is set free from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>knowing that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the death that he died, he died unto sin once for all; but the life that he lives he is living unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even so count yourselves also to be dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore let not sin rule as king in your mortal body, compelling you to obey its lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not continue to present any part of your body to sin to be used as a weapon of unrighteousness. On the contrary, be presenting yourselves to God, as alive from the dead, and the various parts of your bodies to be used as weapons of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For sin shall not lord it over you; for you are not under the rule of law, but under the rule of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then? Shall we commit an act of sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Certainly not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you not know that when you surrender yourselves as slaves to any one to obey him, you are his slaves whom you obey; whether it be sin,  whose end is death, or obedience, whose end is righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But God be thanked that you who were once the slaves of sin have obeyed from your hearts that type of teaching to which you were appointed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and being set free from sin, you became the slaves of righteousness -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I speak in these homely figures because of the weakness of your fleshly nature - just as you once surrendered your faculties into slavery to impurity and to all lawlessness, so now you must surrender your faculties into slavery to righteousness, unto deeds of holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For when you were the slaves of sin, you were under no subjection to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What harvest-fruit then had you at that time in the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But now that you have been set free from sin and become slaves of God, the harvest-fruit which you are reaping tends to produce holiness, and it ends is life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>FOR THE POOR WAGES OF SIN IS DEATH, BUT THE FREE GIFT OF GOD IS ETERNAL LIFE IN CHRIST JESUS, OUR MASTER.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
