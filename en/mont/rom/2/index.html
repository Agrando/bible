You,  the judge, are habitually practising the very same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"We know that Gods judgment against those who practise such vices is in accord with the truth," you say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Very well; and do you suppose, you who judge those that practise such vices, and are doing the very same, that you will elude the judgment of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and long patience? Do you not know that the kindness of God is leading you to repentance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>In your hardness and impenitence of heart you are treasuring up for yourself wrath on the Day of Wrath, when the righteous judgment of God is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For He will render to every man according to his works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>eternal life to those who by patience in well-doing strive for glory and honor and immortality;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but anger and wrath upon those who are self-willed and disobey the truth, but obey unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Anguish and calamity will be upon every soul of man who practises evil, upon the Jew first, and also upon the Gentile;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but glory and honor and peace to every man who does good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For there is no partiality with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For all who have sinned without law will also perish without law;  and all who have sinned under law will be judged by law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it is not the hearers of law who are righteous in the eyes of God; nay, it is the doers of law who will be accounted righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For when Gentiles, who have no law, obey by natural instinct the commands of the Law, they even though they have no law, are a law to themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they show that the work of the Law is written in their hearts,  while their conscience bears them witness, as their reasonings accuse, or it may be defend, them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ,  according to my gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now if you bear the name of a Jew, and rely upon law, and boast yourself in God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and know his will, and can test the things that differ; if you are instructed out of the Law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and are confident that you yourself are a darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the young, because you have in the Law the form of knowledge and of the truth - well then,  you who are teaching others, do you ever teach yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You who are preaching that a man should not steal, do you practise theft?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You who keep saying that a man should not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who hold idols in abhorrence, are you plundering their temples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You who are making your boast in the Law, do you habitually dishonor God through your transgressions of the Law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the name of God is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as the Scripture itself says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Circumcision does indeed profit, if you are obedient to the Law; but if you habitually break the Law, your circumcision is become uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So if the uncircumcised keeps the ordinance of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned equivalent to circumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And shall not those who are physically uncircumcised, but who keep the Law, condemn you who are a breaker of the Law, although you have a written law and circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the real Jew is not the man who is one outwardly, and the real circumcision is not outward in the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but the real Jew is one inwardly, and real circumcision is heart-  circumcision, spiritual, not literal, praised not by men, but by God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
