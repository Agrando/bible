This is your reasonable service of worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your minds, so that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For, through the grace that was given to me, I tell every man among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think, as to think soberly, according to the measure of faith which God has given him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For even as we have many members in one body, and not all members have the same function;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and we are severally members of one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But we have gifts differing according to the grace which was given to us. He that has the gift of prophecy, let him prophesy according to the proportion of his faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If it is the gift of administration, let us give ourselves to our service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let the teacher give himself to his teaching; and he who exhorts others to his exhortation. He who gives, let him do it in singleness of mind. He who rules, let him rule with diligence; and he who shows mercy must be cheerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let love be without insincerity. Abhor what is evil; wed yourselves to what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for brotherly love, be tenderly affectionate one to another, in honor preferring one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In your diligence be free from sloth. Be glowing in spirit. Slave for the master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Rejoice in hope; be patient under affliction; continue stedfast in prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be liberal to needy saints. Practise hospitality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Bless your persecutors, bless, and curse not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Have full sympathy with one another. Set not your minds on high affairs, but associate with lowly folk. Do not be wise in your own conceits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do not pay back evil for evil. Aim to do what is honorable in the eyes of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If it be possible, so far as it lies with you, be at peace with all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Never revenge yourself, beloved, but leave the field clear for Gods wrath; for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay," says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On the contrary, therefore, If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for by so doing you will be heaping burning coals on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not be overcome by evil, but be overcoming evil with good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
