The authorities that now exist have been appointed by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore the man who rebels against authority is opposing the divine ordinances; and those who withstand will bring judgment on themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For rulers are no terror to good deeds, but to evil. Would you be fearless of the rulers authority? Do what is good, and you will have his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the ruler is Gods minister appointed for your good. But if you are a wrong-doer, be afraid; he does not carry the sword to no purpose; he is Gods servant, appointed to vengeance upon the guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Wherefore you must needs be in subjection, not only because of fear,  but also for conscience sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This too, is the reason why you pay taxes; because the authorities are ministers of Gods service, attending continually upon this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render to all their dues; taxes to whom taxes, customs to whom customs, respect to whom respect, and homage to whom homage is due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Never owe any one anything save the debt of brotherly love; for he who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the Law which says, Thou shalt not commit adultery, thou shalt do no murder, thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not bear false witness, thou shalt not covet, and whatever other commandment there be - is all summed up in this one saying, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love never wrongs his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilment of the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Carry out these injunctions because you know the crisis that we are in, that now it is high time for you to awake out of sleep; for now is our salvation nearer than when we first believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far spent; The day is at hand. Let is therefore take off the deeds of darkness, Let us put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us live honestly, as in the day, Not in reveling and drunkenness, Not in lust and licentiousness, Not is strife and jealousy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, And make no provisions for your earthly nature And the gratification of its lusts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
