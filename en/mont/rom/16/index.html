For she herself has been made an overseer to many people, including myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Salute Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow laborers in the cause of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who risked their own lives to save mine; who are thanked not only by me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but by all the churches among the Gentiles. Salute likewise the church that meets in their home. Salute Epaenetus, my dearly beloved,  the first man in Roman Asia to believe in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Salute Mary, who toiled terribly for you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and Andronicus and Junia, my kinsfolk and fellow prisoners, who are notable among the apostles, and who became Christians before I did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and Urbanus, my fellow toiler in Christ; and Stachys, my dear, dear friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Salute Apellas, tested and tried in Christ, and the household of Aristobulus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Herodion, my kinsman. Salute the believing members of the household of Narcissus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Salute Trypheana and Tryphosa, who are ever toiling in the Lord.  Salute dear Persis, who has toiled terribly in the Lords service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Salute Rufus, the chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are associated with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, Olympas, and all the saints associated with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I exhort you, brothers, to keep watch of those who are causing the divisions among you, and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the teaching which you have learned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Turn away from them. For men of that stamp are not the slaves of Christ, but are slaves to their own appetites. By their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I say this, for the tidings of your obedience have been told throughout the world. On your own behalf, then, I rejoice; but I want you to be wise unto the good, but innocents in evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Timothy, my fellow worker, salutes you; so do my fellow countrymen Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I, Tertius, who write this letter, salute you in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Gaius, my host, and the host of the church, salutes you. Erastus,  the treasurer of the city, salutes you, and so does brother Quartus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now I commend you to Him who is able to keep you stedfast, according to my gospel, and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, whereby is unveiled the secret truth which was kept secret through immemorial ages,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but now has been brought to light, and by command of the eternal God made known to the Gentiles by the scriptures of the Prophets, so that the Gentiles might hold obedience of the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Unto Him, the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be glory forever.
