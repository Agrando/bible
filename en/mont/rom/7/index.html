Is the Law sin? Certainly not. On the contrary I should not have become acquainted with sin had it not been for the Law; for except the Law had repeatedly said, "Thou shalt not lust," I should never have known the sin of lust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But when sin had gained a vantage-ground, by means of the commandment, it stirred up within me all manner of lust; for where there is no law, sin is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Once I lived apart from the Law, myself; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the very commandment which should have meant life, this I found to mean death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, when it had gained a vantage-ground through the commandment, beguiled me, and through it slew me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Did then that which was good become for me death? Never! but sin did; that it might be manifest as sin, by that the unutterable malignity of sin might become plain through the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the Law is spiritual; but as for me, I am a creature of flesh, bought and sold under the dominion of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For what I perform I know not; what I practise is not what I intend to do, but what I detest, that I habitually do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If then I habitually do what I do not intend to do, I am consenting to the Law, that it is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now it is longer I myself who do the deed, but it is sin which has its home in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me, that is in my flesh, no good thing has its home; for while to will is present with me, to carry out that which is right is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good that I intend to do, I do not; but the evil which I do not; but the evil which I do not intend to do, that I am ever practising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I do the very thing I do not intend to do, it is no more I who practise it, but sin which has its home in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find, then, this law, that when I intend to do good, evil is ever present with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For in my inmost self I delight in the law of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I find a different law in my bodily faculties, waging war with the law of my will, and taking me prisoner to that law of sin which is in my bodily faculties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Oh, wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from this slave of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Oh, thank God! it is through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then I myself in my will am in thraldom to the law of God; yet in my animal nature I am in thraldom to the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
