For through the Holy Spirit who has given to us, the "brimming river of the love of God" has overflowed in our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For while we were still without strength, Christ died in due time for the ungodly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Why, a man will hardly give his life for another, even for a righteous man, though perchance for a good man one might even take it upon himself to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But God gives proof of his love to us by the fact that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By how much more, then, being now justified in his blood, shall we be saved through him from the wrath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For if, when we were Gods enemies, we were reconciled to him through the death of his Son, how much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved in his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And not only that, but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now obtained our reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus, then, sin came into the world through one man, and through sin came death and so death spread to all men, because all had sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For prior to the Law, sin actually existed in the world, but sin was not set down to mans account when there was no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless, from Adam to Moses death reigned as king, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adams transgression.  Now Adam is a type of Him who was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the free gift is not like the transgression; for if through the transgression of that one man the rest on men died, much more did the grace of God and the gift given in his grace in the one Man, Jesus Christ, overflow unto the rest of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it is not with the free gift as it was through the one that sinned; for the judgment came from one transgression unto condemnation; but the free gift came from many transgressions unto acquittal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if through the transgression of the one, death reigned as king through the one, much more shall those who receive the overflowing grace and gift of righteousness reign as kings in life through One,  through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It follows then, as through the transgression of one man came condemnation unto all men, even so through the act of righteousness of One came acquittal and life to all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For just as through the disobedience of one man the rest were made sinners; even so by the obedience of One shall all the rest be made righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now law was brought in so that transgression might abound; but where sin abounded, grace super-abounded;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>in order that as sin has ruled as king in death, so also grace might rule as king in righteousness which issues in eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord,  - ours!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
