And Abraham believed God, and it was set down to his account as righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now if a man earn his pay by his work, it is not counted to him as a favor, but it is paid him as a debt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but a man who does not "work," but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, has his faith imputed to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Just as David also speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from actions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Blessed he says are they whose iniquities have been forgiven, And whose sins have been covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is this blessing, then, for the circumcised alone? or for the uncircumcised also? Abrahams faith, I say, was imputed to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then was it imputed to him? When he was circumcised? or uncircumcised? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and he received circumcision as a sign, a seal of the faith-  righteousness which he had while he was in uncircumcision; in order that he might be the father of all who believe, even though they are uncircumcised; so that righteousness might be imputed to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He is the father of circumcision to those who are not merely circumcised, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham which he held while he was as yet uncircumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the promise that he should be heir of the world did not come to Abraham or to his posterity through law, but through faith-  righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if those who are righteous through law are heirs, faith is empty and the promise becomes void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For law works wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is why righteousness is of faith, that it may be a free gift;  so that the promise stands firm to all Abrahams posterity; not to his children of his faith. For in the sight of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead, and calls into being that which is not, Abraham is the father of us all both Jews and Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>as it is written, I have made you a father of many nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Abraham, hoping against hope, had faith to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So numberless shall your descendants be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Though he was about a hundred years old, his faith did not fail him when he regarded his own body, now as good as dead. and remembered Sarahs barrenness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nor did he with regard to the promise of God waver in unbelief, but he waxed strong in faith, while he gave God glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and was fully persuaded that what God had promised, he was able also to perform.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And so his faith was reckoned to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now these words were not written simply for his sake, but for us as well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For it will be "reckoned for righteousness." to us also, who believe on him that raised from the dead our Lord Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was betrayed to death for our transgressions, and raised again to life for our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
