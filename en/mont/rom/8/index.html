By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and on account of sin, he condemned sin in the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>in order that the Law might be fulfilled in us who order our lives not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For they who live after the flesh, give their attention to the things of the flesh; But they who live after the spirit, give their attention to spiritual things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>To be earthly minded means death; To be spiritually minded means life and peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For to be earthly minded is enmity against God; For such a mind is not subject to the Law of God, Nor can it be;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they who are earthly minded cannot please God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you are not earthly, but spiritual, if indeed the Spirit of God is really dwelling in you. If any one does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if Christ is in you, though your bodily self is dead because of sin, your spirit is full of life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit of Him who raised up Jesus from dead is dwelling in you, He who raised up Jesus from the dead is dwelling in you, He who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead will also make your dying bodily self live by his indwelling Spirit in your lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, brothers, we are debtors - but not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for if you go on living according to the flesh, you are on the road to die; but if by the Spirit you keep putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For only those are sons of God who are led by Gods Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you have not received a spirit of slavery in order that you should once more be afraid; but you have received a spirit of adoption, in which we cry out, "My Father, my dear Father!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For his Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ; but to share his glory, we must now be sharing his sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I count as nothing what we now suffer, in comparison with the glory which will soon be unveiled to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All nature even is waiting with eager longing for the unveiling of the vision of Gods sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For nature was subjected to imperfection, not by its own will, but by the will of Him who thus made it subject -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>yet not without the hope that some day nature itself also will be freed from the thraldom of decay, into the freedom which belongs to the glory of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that all nature has been groaning and travailing together until this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only that, we ourselves, although we are grasping the first-  fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves are inwardly groaning, while we are waiting for adoption, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For by hope we are saved; but hope which is clearly seen is no longer hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Who hopes for what he clearly sees? But if we hope for something that we do not see, we then patiently wait for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In the same way the Spirit also takes hold with us in our weakness;  for we know knot how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the Searcher of Hearts knows what the Sprits meaning is,  because his intercessions for the saints are according to the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now we know that all things continually work together for good to to those who love God, to those who have been the called according to his purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, so that he might be the eldest of a great brotherhood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and whom he foreordained, those he also called; and whom he called,  those he also justified; and whom he justified, those he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What shall we say then, to these things? If God be for us, Who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He that spared not his own Son, But freely delivered him up for us all, How shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who shall accuse Gods elect? God acquits them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is there to condemn them? Will Christ who died? Yes, and who rose from the dead, The Christ who is also at the right hand of God,  And is interceding for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>What shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall anguish, or calamity, or persecution, or famine? Shall nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Even as it is written. For thy sake we are killed all the day long;  We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors Through Him who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am fully persuaded that neither death nor life, Neither angels nor principalities, nor powers, Neither the present world nor the world to come, Nor the powers of Nature,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Nor height, nor depth, Nor any other created thing, Shall be able to separate us from the love of God Which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
