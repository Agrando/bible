There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that arises to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the God of all hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may be overflowing with hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I myself also am confident regarding you, my brothers, that you yourselves are already full of goodness, filled with all knowledge,  and well able to give advice to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Still I have written unto you the more boldly, in part, by way of reminding you, because of that gift of grace which God bestowed upon me, in making me a priest of Jesus Christ unto the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I act as priest of the gospel of God; so that the Gentiles, when offered before him, may be an acceptable sacrifice, because consecrated by the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have then my boast in Christ Jesus concerning the things of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will not dare to speak of any thing except that which Christ has done through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>through the might of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit. So that beginning at Jerusalem and its environs, I have proclaimed without reserve the gospel of Christ, even as far as Illyricum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My ambition has been, however, to preach the gospel where Christs name was not already known, so that I might not build upon another mans foundation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But, as Scripture says, He shall be seen by those to whom no news about him ever came, And those who have never heard of him shall understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>This is why I have been so hindered from coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now, since I have no more any "opening" in these parts, and since I have longed for many years to come to you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whenever I go to Spain, I am hoping to see you on my way there, and to be set forward by you on my way there, and to be set forward by you on my journey thither, after I have enjoyed your company for a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Just now I am going to Jerusalem to serve the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make an offering for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yes, it has been made their good pleasure, and their debt, too. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual riches,  they owe it to them also to minister to them the Jews in worldly goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When, therefore, I have settled this, and have secured to them the poor at Jerusalem the fruit of this collection, I shall come on by you into Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Brothers, I beseech you, by Jesus Christ our Lord, and by the love which the Spirit gives, to help me in my struggle by your prayers to God on my behalf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from the disobedient in Judea; that my mission to Jerusalem may be favorably received by the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and that I may come to you in joy, by the will of God, and find rest together with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The God of peace be with you all! Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
