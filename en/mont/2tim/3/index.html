In the last days grievous times will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For men will be selfish, mercenary, boastful, haughty, blasphemous,  disobedient to parents, ungrateful, irreligious,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>without natural affection, merciless, slanderous, dissolute, and brutal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They will hate goodness, they will be treacherous, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure, rather than lovers of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For although they keep up the outward form of religion, they deny its power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Turn away from all such. Some of them creep into private houses and lead captive silly women who, laden with sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and led captive by ever-changing impulses, are always learning but never able to arrive at knowledge of truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so also do these men withstand the truth; being corrupt in mind and worthless in all that concerns the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they will not get on; for their folly will be made as openly manifest to all as was that of Jannes and Jambres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But you, Timothy, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aims, my faith, patience, love, endurance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>as well as the persecutions and sufferings which befell me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. You know all the persecutions I endured, and how the Lord delivered me out of them all!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yes, and all who purpose to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But wicked men and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving others, and being themselves deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But do you hold fast what you have learned and have held to be true.  You know those from whom you have learned it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and how from a child you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Every Scripture, seeing that it is God-breathed, is also profitable for teaching, for refutation, for correction, and for training in righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that the man of God may himself be complete, and completely equipped for every good work.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
