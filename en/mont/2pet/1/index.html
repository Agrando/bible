Unto this you do well to give heed as to a lamp shining in a dark place, till the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But first be assured of this - that no prophecy of Scripture is of private interpretation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For no prophecy was ever brought by the will of man; but moved by the Holy Spirit, men spoke for God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
