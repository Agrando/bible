Then the crowds, when they saw what Paul had done, shouted in the Lycaonian tongue, saying, "The gods are come down to us in human form."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they began to call Barnabas "Zeus," and Paul, since he was the principal speaker, "Hermes";</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and along with the crowds was about to offer sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the apostles, Paul and Barnabas, heard of it, they rent their garments and rushed out among the crowd, shouting and crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Men, why are you doing all this? We also are men, with natures like your own! We are bringing you good tidings, that you are to turn from these empty things to the living God, who made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In bygone generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good,  and gave you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even with saying this they with difficulty restrained the crowds from sacrificing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now a party of Jews came down form Antioch and Iconium, and after persuading the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But as the disciples collected around him, he rose and went back into the city. The next day he went off with Barnabas into Derbe;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and after preaching the gospel to that town, and winning many converts, they went back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Everywhere they strengthened the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to hold to the faith. "It is through many tribulations," they said, "that we must enter into the kingdom of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They chose elders for them in every church, after prayer and fasting, and commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then passing through Pisidia they came to Pamphylia and,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>after preaching the word in Perga, they came down to Attaleia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been commended to the grace of God, for the work which they had now completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>On their arrival they assembled the church and reported all things that God had done through them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they tarried no little time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
