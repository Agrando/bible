He brought only a part and laid it at the apostles feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Ananias," said Peter, "why has Satan so filled your heart that you are lying to the Holy Spirit, and keeping back part of the price of the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"While it remained unsold, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was not the price at your own disposal? How could you conceive this act in your heart? You have not lied unto men, but unto God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>As Ananias heard these words he fell down and expired, and all who heard were awe-struck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the younger men rose, wrapped the body up, and carried it out to bury it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and Peter said to her, "Tell me if you got so much for the land."  "Yes," she said, "so much."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Why was it," said Peter, "that you both agreed to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Lo, the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Instantly she fell down at his feet and expired, and when the young men came in they found her dead, and carried her out and buried her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear fell on all the church and upon all who had heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Many signs and wonders continued to be wrought among the people by the hands of the apostles, and by common consent they all would meet in Solomons Porch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but none of the rest dared to associate with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet the people continued to hold them in high honor, and more and more believers in the Lord were joining them, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In consequence people would even bring out their sick into the streets, and place them upon beds and pallets as Peter was passing,  that at least his shadow might fall upon some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The people of the towns near Jerusalem also continued to come in crowds, bringing their sick and those who were harried by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This aroused bitter indignation among the high priest and his followers who were of the sect of the Sadducees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and they apprehended the apostles, and threw them into the public prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors during the night,  and let them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said to them, "Go take your stand in the Temple, and continue to tell the people all the words of this Life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When they heard this they went at early dawn to the Temple, and began to teach. Meantime when the high priest and his followers arrived, they summoned the Sanhedrin and all the Council of the Elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to fetch the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the officers who went did not find them in the prison; so they came back and reported,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"The prison we found locked fast, with the guards stationed at the doors, but when they were opened we found no one inside."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the officer in charge of the Temple and the high priest heard these words, they were perplexed concerning them, wondering what would come of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And some one came and told them that the very men whom they had put in prison were standing in the Temple, and teaching to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On this the officer went off with his men and fetched them, not,  however, by force, for they were afraid that the people would stone them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they brought them, and stood them before the Sanhedrin. Then the high priest questioned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"We strictly forbade you, did we not, to teach about this Name, and here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this mans blood upon us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter and the apostles said in reply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"We must obey God rather than man. The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom you slew by hanging him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"Him God has exalted at his right hand as Prince and Saviour, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"And we are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they heard this they were infuriated, and were minded to kill the apostles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but Gamaliel, a Pharisee, a teacher of the law, and held in honor by all the people, rose from his seat, and ordered the apostles to be put outside for a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He said. "Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Years ago Theudas arose, claiming to be somebody, and was joined by about four hundred men. He was killed, and all of his followers dispersed and annihilated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"After him Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment,  and drew away some of the people after him. He also perished, and all his followers were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"And now, I say to you, hold aloof from these men. Let them alone;  for if this scheme or work be of human origin it will come to nothing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"but if it is from God, you cannot put it down; you may even find yourselves fighting against God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They gave in to him; and called the apostles in, and after flogging them, released them, with instructions not to speak about the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they left Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace for the sake of the Name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but not for a single day did they desist from teaching and preaching in the Temple, and in private houses, the Gospel of Jesus, the Messiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
