There also accompanied me these six brothers, and we went into the mans house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Then he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying. "Send to Joppa and fetch Simon who is also called Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"He will speak words to you by which you and all your family will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"And," said Peter, "as soon as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as he fell upon us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Then I remembered the words of the Lord, how he used to say, "John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"So if God gave them the same gift as he gave to us, when we first believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On hearing this they held their peace and glorified God, saying,  "Forsooth then, to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance unto life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then those who had been scattered by the trouble that arose over Stephen, traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch; but they preached the word to none except Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Some of them, however, were Cyprians and Cyrenaeans, who, on reaching Antioch, began to tell the Greeks also the Good News concerning the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When news of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he arrived, and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord, with full purpose of heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he was a good man, and full of faith and the Holy Spirit. And a great multitude was added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Barnabas visited Tarsus, to try to find Saul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch, where for a whole year they were guests of the church, and taught many people.  And it was in Antioch that the disciples first received the name of "Christians."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>At that time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>One of them, who was Agabus, rose up, and being instructed by the Spirit, predicted that a great famine was about to come upon the whole inhabited earth. (It came in the reign of Claudius.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So the disciples decided to send relief, every man according to his means, to the brothers in Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This they did, forwarding their contributions to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
