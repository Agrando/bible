"For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, "The will of the Lord be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A few days after this we took up our luggage and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And some of the disciples from Caesarea accompanied us. They led us to the house of Mnason, a Cypriote, a disciple of long standing, with whom we were to lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At length we reached Jerusalem, and the brothers there received us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>On the following day we went with Paul to call on James, and all the elders were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After saluting them Paul rehearsed, one by one, the things that God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they, when they heard it, glorified God, and said to him. "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews, of those who have believed, and they are all zealous for the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Now what they have been told about you, again and again, is that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moses,  and not to circumcise their children, nor to follow the old customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"What then ought to be done? They will certainly hear that you are come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"So do this that we tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"We have four men here under a vow; associate yourself with them,  purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses so that they may have their heads shaved; then every one will know that there is no truth in the rumors that they have heard about you; but that you yourself walk orderly obeying the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"As for the Gentile believers, we wrote giving judgment that they should abstain from anything sacrificed to an idol, from blood, from what is strangled, and from fornication."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and after purifying himself with them next day, went into the temple to declare the fulfilment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for every one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when the seven days were almost over, the Asiatic Jews caught sight of him in the temple, and began to stir up all the crowd, and laid hands on him, shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Men of Israel, help! This is the man who goes everywhere preaching to everybody against the people, and the Law, and this place. And he has actually brought Gentiles even into the temple, and has desecrated the holy place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For they had formerly seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city, and supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The whole city was thrown into uproar. The mob surged together,  seized Paul, and began to drag him outside the temple. Whereupon the doors were at once shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>While they were attempting to kill him, news came to the tribune commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>At once he took soldiers and centurions, and rushed down upon them.  When they saw the tribune and the troops, they left off beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the tribune came up and seized him, and ordered that he be bound with two chains. "Who is he?" he began asking, "and what has he done?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Some among the crowd kept shouting one thing, some another; and when the tribune could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered Paul into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>When was going up the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers,  because of the violence of the mob,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for the whole mass of the people were following him, shouting, "Away with him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Just as he was about to be taken into the barracks, Paul said to the tribune, "May I speak to you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"Do you know Greek?" said the tribune; "Are you not, then, the Egyptian who in days gone by stirred up to sedition, and let into the wilderness the four thousand cutthroats?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"I am a Jew," answered Paul, "a native of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city. And I pray you, give me permission to speak to the people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when he had given leave, Paul stood on the stairs, beckoning with his hands to the people. There came a great hush, and he spoke to them as follows, in Hebrew.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
