But after waiting a long time, and seeing no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said over and over that he was a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now in the neighborhood there were estates belonging to the governor of the island, whose name was Publius. He received us and entertained us for three days courteously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It happened however that the father of Publius was lying ill of fever and dysentery. So Paul went to see him and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this all the other sick people on the island came, and continued to be restored to health.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>These loaded us with many honors and, when at last we set sail, they put on board such things as we needed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Three months passed before we set sail an Alexandrian ship which had wintered in the island. Its name was "The Twin Brothers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From thence, tacking round, we reached Rhegium. Next day a south wind sprang up, which brought us in a day to Puteoli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There we found brothers who invited us to stay a week with them.  Then we reached Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From there the brothers, when they heard about us, came out to meet us as far as the Appian Forum and the Three Taverns. When Paul saw them he thanked God and took courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When we finally entered Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier to guard him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now three days later he called the leading Jews together, and when they were come together he said to them. "Brothers, I was delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, though I had done nothing against the people or the customs of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Then when they had examined me they wanted to set me at liberty because there was no cause of death in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"But when the Jews objected I was forced to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This is the reason why I begged you to see and speak with me. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said to him. "We neither received any letters about you from Judea nor has any brother come hither to report or speak any harm of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"But we are eager to hear from you what it is that you believe; for we all know that as for this sect it is everywhere spoken against."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they arranged a day with him and came to him in his lodgings in great numbers. He expounded the matter to them; testifying to the Kingdom of God, and persuading them about Jesus, from morning till evening, both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some began to believe what he said, but some were unbelieving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Unable to agree among themselves, they began to go, but not before Paul had spoken a word to them, saying. "Right well did the Holy Spirit say to your ancestors, through the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Go to the people and tell them, You will hear and hear, and by no means understand; And will look, and by no means see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this peoples heart is grown obtuse, Their ears are heavy of hearing, Their eyes have they closed, Lest they should see with their eyes And hear with their ears, Lest they understand with their heart,  And turn again, and heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Be fully assured, therefore, that this salvation of God is now sent unto the Gentiles. They will listen to it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he finished speaking, the Jews departed, and reasoned among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>After this Paul lived for two whole years in his own rented house,  and used to receive all who came to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He continued to preach the kingdom of God, and to teach about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, quite unmolested.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
