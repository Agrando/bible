There we remained for a week.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the first day of the week we met for the breaking of bread, and Paul, who was going away the next morning, began preaching to them,  and prolonged his discourse until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now there were many lamps in the upper room where we were assembled,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and a young man named Eutychus was sitting in a window, overborne by deep sleep, while Paul continued to preach at length. Overcome at last by sleep, he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Paul went down, threw himself upon him, and embracing him,  said. "Do not lament; his life is still in him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he went upstairs again, broke bread and took some food, and after talking with them a long time, even until daybreak, he left them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They had taken the lad home alive, and were not a little comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The rest of us going before to the ship, set sail for Assos,  intending to take Paul on board there; for so he had appointed,  because he intended to go by land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We sailed from thence, and arrived next day off Chios; and the day after we touched at Samos; and the following day we came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, so as not to spend time in Asia, for he was hurrying to get to Jerusalem, if it were possible, by the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the elders of the church to come to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and when they arrived, he said to them. "You yourselves know quite well, how I lived among you, from the first day that I set foot in Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"serving the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and amid trials that befell me through the plots of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"You know that I never shrank from declaring to you anything that was profitable, nor from teaching you publicity and in your homes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>testifying both to Jews and Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not knowing what will befall me there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that in city after city the Holy Spirit is warning me that bonds and afflictions are awaiting me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I hold not my life of any account, as dear unto myself, if only I may run my race, and accomplish the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to attest the gospel of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now I know that not one of you among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will ever see my face again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So I testify to you this day that I am clear from the blood of all men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I never shrank from telling you the whole counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has appointed you overseers, and be shepherds of the church of God which he has purchased with his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come among you,  and they will not spare the flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and that from among your own number, men will arise, perverting the truth, to draw away the disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So be on guard; and remember that for three years I ceased not to admonish you all, night and day, even with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace. He is able to build you up, and to give you your inheritance among all those who are consecrated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"No mans silver or gold of clothing did I ever covet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"You yourselves know how these hands of mine provided for my needs,  and those of my companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"In all things I have set you an example, how that so toiling, you ought to help the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,  how he himself said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When he had so said, Paul kneeled down, and prayed with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all began, with loud lamentations, to throw their arms about his neck, and to kiss him lovingly, again and again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>sorrowing most of all for the words that he had spoken, that after that day they should look upon his face no more. And they began to escort him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
