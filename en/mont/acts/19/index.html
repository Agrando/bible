"No" said they, "we did not even hear that there is a Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"Into what, then, were you baptized?" he asked. And they said, "Into the baptism of John."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"John indeed baptized with the baptism of repentance," answered Paul, "telling the people to believe on One who was coming after him,  namely, on Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they heard this they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and after Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak with tongues, and to prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They were in all about twelve men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Paul went into the synagogue, and there continued to preach fearlessly for about three months, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some grew hardened and disobedient, and spoke evil of the Way before the crowd, he left them, withdrew the disciples, and continued to hold discussions daily in the lecture-hall of Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia heard the Lords message, Jews as well as Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God also wrought extraordinary miracles by the hand of Paul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so much so, that handkerchiefs or aprons were carried away from his body to the sick; and their diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But there were also some strolling Jewish exorcists, who took it upon them to invoke the name of Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish high priest who used to do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the evil spirit answered, "Jesus I know, and Paul I have heard of, but who are you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them,  overpowered them and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this became known to all the people of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. Awe fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Many also of those who became believers used to come to confess and to declare their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And some of them who had practised magic arts, collected their books, and burned them in the presence of all. And they counted the price of them, and found it to be fifty thousand silver coins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So mightily the word of the Lord continued to grow and to prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now after these things were ended, Paul resolved in his spirit to travel through Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem. "After I get there," he said, "I must see Rome, too."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So he sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, while he himself kept back for a time on his way into Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now just at this time, there arose no small commotion concerning the Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There was a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, and brought rich profit to his workmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He gathered them together with others of like occupation, and said.  "Men, you know that by this business we make our money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but almost throughout all of Asia, this fellow Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, by telling them that they are no gods at all who are made with hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"So there is danger not only that our trade come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will be brought into disrepute, and that she herself may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world now worships."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After listening to this they were filled with rage, and cried out again and again, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The city was filled with commotion. They rushed like one man into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians,  Pauls companions in travel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not let him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and some of the Asiarchs, too, who were his friends, sent word to him repeatedly, entreating him not to venture into the theater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now some were shouting one thing, some another, for the assembly was in an uproar, and the majority had no idea why they were come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they brought Alexander out of the crowd, whom the Jews had pushed forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, would have made a defense to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>but when they saw that he was a Jew they all, with one voice, for about two hours, shouted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>At length the recorder got them quiet. "Men of Ephesus," he said,  "who here does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-  guardian of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Since these facts cannot be gainsaid, you ought to be calm and do nothing reckless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If then Demetrius and his craftsmen have a grievance against any one, the courts are open and there are the proconsuls; let them accuse one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if you desire anything further, it must be settled in the regular assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For indeed we are in danger of being accused in regard to this days riot, since there is no cause for it, nor shall we be able to give account for this disorderly gathering."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>With these words he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
