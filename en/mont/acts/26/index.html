So Paul stretched forth his hand and began to make his defense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>"I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my defense before you this day, in regard to all the accusations brought against me by the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"especially since you are an export in all Jewish customs and questions. I pray you, expert in all Jewish customs and questions. I pray you, hear me with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"The kind of life I have lived from my youth upward among my own nation and at Jerusalem, all that early life of mine, is well known to all the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"They know me of old, if they are willing to testify, how that according to the strict sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Today I am standing trial because of the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"a promise which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. It is concerning this hope, King Agrippa, that I am accused by the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Why is it deemed incredible by you all, if God raises the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"I indeed once thought with myself that I ought to do many things against the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"And this also I did in Jerusalem. Armed with authority from the chief priests, I shut up many of the saints in prison, and when they were condemned to death I gave my vote against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"In all the synagogues also I punished them oftentimes, and tried to make them blaspheme; and in my mad fury I was pursuing them even to foreign cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"On this errand I was traveling to Damascus one day, armed with authority and commission of the chief priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"when at noon, as I journeyed, O King, I saw a light from heaven,  brighter than the sun, shining around me and around those who journeyed with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"We all fell to the ground; and I heard a voice saying to me in Hebrew. "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Who are you, Lord? I said. "And the Lord said. I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"But rise and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you in order to appoint you my minister and my witness both of what you have already seen and of those things in which I will appear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"I will deliver you from the Jewish people, and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you to open their eyes</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, in order to receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"So then, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"but I proceeded to preach, first to those in Damascus, and then in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they must repent and turn to God and do deeds worthy of repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"But having obtained the help that comes from God, I stand even to this day witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing except what the prophets and Moses said should come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"how that the Christ must suffer, and how he should be the first to rise from the dead, and should bring a message of light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As Paul thus made his defense, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice.  "Paul, you are raving mad; your great learning is driving you mad."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"I am not mad, most noble Festus," said Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"I am speaking words of sober truth. For the King, to whom I am speaking freely, knows of these matters. I am persuaded that not one of these things has escaped his notice; for these things were not done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Agrippa answered, "In short, you are doing your best to persuade me to become a Christian."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Long or short," answered Paul, "my prayer to God is that not only you but all who are my hearers this day might become such as I am,  save for these chains."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the king rose, and Bernice, and those who were sitting with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When they had withdrawn they continued talking to one another. "This man is doing nothing," they said, "for which he deserves death or imprisonment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, "If he had not appealed to Caesar, he might have been set free."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
