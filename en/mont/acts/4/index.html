For it is well known throughout Jerusalem that a notable miracle has been performed by them, and we cannot deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"But that the matter may spread no further among the people, let us threaten them not to speak to any one hereafter about this name."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So they summoned them, and ordered them not to speak at all, nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John said in reply. "Do you decide whether in the sight of God it is right to obey you rather than God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but for our part, we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So when they had further threatened them they let the apostles go,  being quite unable to find any way of punishing them because of the people, for everybody was glorifying God over what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought was over forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As soon as the apostles were released, they went to their friends,  and told what the high priests and elders had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they heard it they all lifted up their voices in prayer to God, saying. "O Sovereign Lord, who madest heaven and earth and sea,  and all that in them is,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"who saidest through the Holy Spirit, by the lips of thy servant David, our forefather. "Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples form futile plans?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together Against the Lord and against his Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"In this very city they did gather together against thy holy Servant, Jesus whom thou hast anointed - Herod and Pontius Pilate,  with the Gentiles and also the tribes of Israel -</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"to do all that thy power and thy will had predetermined should be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"And now Lord, listen to their threats, and grant to thy slaves to proclaim thy message with all boldness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"whilst thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; grant too, that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant,  Jesus."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken;  and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak the message of the Lord with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the multitude of the believers was of one heart and one soul,  nor did any one of them say that any of his possessions was his own;  but they had all things common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the apostles continued with great power to give their witness concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nor was there any one of them in want, for all who owned houses or lands would sell them and bring the price of the things that were sold, and lay it at the apostles feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and distribution would be made to each according to his need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>In this way Joseph, whom the apostles called Barnabas ("Son of Encouragement" is what it means), who was a native Cyprus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>sold a farm which he had, and brought the price, and laid it at the apostles feet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
