"Are not these Galileans who are speaking?" they exclaimed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Then how is it that each one of us hears them speak his own mother tongue?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Parthians, Medes, Elamites, dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea, in Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>in Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the district of Lybia around Cretans and Arabians,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>we all hear these men telling in our own tongue what great things God has done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All were astonished and bewildered and kept saying to one another,  "What can this mean?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But others were saying with jeer, "These men are full of sweet wine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Peter, with the Eleven, stood up and addresses them in a loud voice. "Men of Judea and dwellers in Jerusalem, have no doubt about this matter, but listen to what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"These men are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only nine oclock in the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"No, this is what the prophet Joel predicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"In the last days, God says, it shall come to pass that I will pour out my Spirit upon all mankind; "Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>upon my slaves, both men and women, in those days, will I pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the sky above I will show marvels, And signs in the earth beneath; Blood and fire, and vapor of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Into darkness shall the sun be turned, And into blood the moon, Ere the day of the Lord come, that great and terrible day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And every one who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Men of Israel, listen to these words. Jesus the Nazarene, a man accredited to you by God, through mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him among you, as you yourselves know;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>him, delivered up by the settled purpose and fore-knowledge of God,  you crucified and killed at the hands of lawless men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but God has raised him to life, having loosed the pangs of death,  because it was not possible for death to hold him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says of him. "I beheld the Lord always before my face; For he is at my right hand lest I be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Therefore my heart is glad, my tongue exults, my very body also shall pitch its tent in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"For thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, Nor give up thy Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Thou hast made known to me the paths of life, Thou wilt fill me with gladness in thy presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Men and brothers, I can speak plainly to you concerning the patriarch David, because he not only died and was buried, but his tomb is among us even to this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"Because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath that of the fruit of his loins he would set one on his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"he, foreseeing this, spoke of the resurrection of Christ that neither was he left in Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus God has raised up, of this we are all witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Since he is by the mighty hand of God exalted, and has received from his Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured forth this which you now see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not ascend into heaven; but he himself said, "The Lord said to my Lord Sit thou on my right hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"Until I make thine enemies A footstool under thy feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Therefore let the whole House of Israel know assuredly that Gods has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you have crucified."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When they heard these words they were stung to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles. "Men and brothers, what shall we do?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"Repent," answered Peter, "and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"For the promise belongs to you and to your children and to all who are afar off, whomever the Lord may call."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>With many other words he continued to bear testimony, and kept entreating them, saying, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then those who welcomed his message were baptized, and in that day about three thousand souls were added to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they stedfastly continued in the teaching of the apostles, and in the fellowship, in the breaking of the bread, and in the prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were wrought by the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all the believers were together, and had all things in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>They would sell their lands and other property, and distribute the proceeds among all, just as any one from time had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Day after day they continued stedfastly with one accord in the Temple; and breaking bread together in their own homes, they continued to eat their food with gladness and an undivided heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God, and looked on with favor by all the people. Meanwhile the Lord kept adding to them daily those that were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
