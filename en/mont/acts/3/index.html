Then Peter said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"I have neither silver nor gold, but what I do have, this I am going to give to you; in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, walk!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then taking his right hand he lifted him up. Instantly his feet and ankle-bones were strengthened;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and leaping forth he stood on his feet, and began to walk, and went with them into the Temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When all the people saw him walking and praising God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and recognized that this was the man who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, they were filled with awe and amazement at what had happened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While he was clinging to Peter and John, all the people crowded awe-  struck around them, in what was known as Solomons Portico.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he saw this, Peter said to the people. "Men of Israel, why are you wondering at this? Why do you stare at us, as if by our own power or piety we had made this man to walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"The God of Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and disowned before Pilate, when he had decided to let him go;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"but you disowned the holy and righteous One, and asked as a favor the release of a murderer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"The Pioneer of Life you put to death. But God has raised him from the dead, and we are witnesses of that fact.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"And his name, on the ground of faith in his name, has made strong this man, whom you now see and know; yes, the faith that is through him has made this man sound and strong again, in the presence of you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"And now, brothers, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did also your rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"But God has thus fulfilled what he foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Repent then! and reform, from the blotting out of your sins, so that there may come times of refreshing from the presence of the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"and that he may send Jesus, your appointed Messiah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"whom the heavens must receive until the time of restoration of all things. "God spoke of this ages ago, through the mouth of his holy prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Moses, for example, said. "The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet for you from among your brothers, as he raised up me; you must listen to whatever he may tell you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"and it shall be that every soul who will not listen to that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and his successors, all that have spoken, have also told of those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"You are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, "And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"It was for you first that God raised up his Servant, and sent him to bless you in turning every one of you away from your wicked ways."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
