"It is not fitting for us to leave off preaching the Word of God, and minister at tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"So, brothers, find from among your own number seven men of good reputation who are full of the Spirit and of wisdom, and we will appoint them over this business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"But we will give ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the Word."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>This plan commended itself to the whole body, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip,  Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These men they presented to the apostles who, when they had prayed,  laid their hands upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the word of the Lord continued to spread; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was increasing exceedingly, and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Meanwhile Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought great wonders and signs among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But certain men from the so-called "Synagogue of the Freedmen" and certain Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, Cilicians, and men from Roman Asia, started to dispute with Stephen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but were unable to withstand the wisdom and spirit with which he used to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they instigated some to say, "We have heard him speaking blasphemy against Moses and against God;" and in this way they excited the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The elders and the scribes rushed upon him, and seized him, and brought him into the Sanhedrin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They also set up false witnesses who testified.
