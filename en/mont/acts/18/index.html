"Your blood be upon your own hands. I am clean.  From now on I will go to the Gentiles."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So he left the place, and went into the house of a man named Titus Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house adjoined the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Crispus, the warden of the synagogue, believed on the Lord, with all his household; and many of the Corinthians from time to time listened, believed, and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said to Paul in a vision, by night. "Have no fear; go on speaking, and do not keep silent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"for I am with you, and no one shall set upon you to injure you; for I have very many people in this city."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So he lived there a year and six months and continued to teach them the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose against Paul, and brought him before the tribunal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"This fellow," they said, "is persuading men to offer unlawful worship to God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Paul was about to open his mouth, when Gallio said to the Jews. "If it had been some misdemeanor or wicked villainy, it would have been within reason for me to listen to you Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but as these are merely questions about words and names and your own law, you yourselves must see to it. I am not willing to be a judge of these matters."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them from the tribunal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they all laid hold of Sosthenes, the warden of the synagogue,  and beat him in front of the tribunal; but Gallio took no notice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Paul after remaining in Corinth some time longer, took leave of the brothers, and sailed away to Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. As Paul was under a vow, he had his head shaved at Cenchrea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When they came to Ephesus he left them there; but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they begged him to stay longer, he would not consent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but said, as he took leave of them, "I will return again to you, if God will."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then, setting sail from Ephesus, he landed at Caesarea; he went up to Jerusalem and saluted the church, and came down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After spending some time there, he set out and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, in order, and strengthened all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, a learned man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He had been instructed in the ways of the Lord, and being full of zeal, he used to speak and to teach accurately the facts about Jesus,  although he knew only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue; and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him they took him home and explained to him more accurately the way of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When he wished to cross over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples in Corinth to receive him. On his arrival he mightily helped those who through grace had believed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public argument, proving to them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
