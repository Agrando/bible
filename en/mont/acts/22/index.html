It was from them that I received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was already on my way to bring those also who were there back to Jerusalem, in bonds, for punishment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"But when, on my journey, I was nearing Damascus, about noon,  suddenly a great light from heaven shone round about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, "Saul! Saul!  why are you persecuting me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Who are you, Lord? I asked. "I am Jesus, the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting, he answered me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Now my companions, though they beheld the light, did not hear the words of Him who spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"And I said, What shall I do, Lord? and the Lord said to me, Rise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told about all that you are destined to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"And as I was seeing nothing for the glory of the light, I was led by the hand of my companions, and so came into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the Law, well thought of by all the Jews who lived there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"came to me, and standing by me, said to me, "Brother Saul, receive your sight "In that very hour I regained my sight and looked up at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Then he said. "The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know his will; and to see the righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"For before the face of all men you will be a witness for him of what you have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling upon his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"After my return to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"I fell into a trance and saw him saying to me, "Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive your testimony concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Lord, I replied, they themselves well know that I was beating and imprisoning in synagogue after synagogue those who believed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"and when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting, and holding the garments of his murders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Depart, he said to me, for I will send you forth, far hence, to the Gentiles."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Until they heard this last statement, the people were listening to Paul, but now they roared out. "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He is not fit to live!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When they continued to shout, throwing their clothes into the air,  and flinging dust around,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and examined under the lash, to learn for what reason the people were thus crying out against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who was standing near, "If a man is a Roman citizen, and uncondemned, is it lawful for you to scourge him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the centurion heard that, he went to the tribune and said to him. "What are you intending to do? This man is a Roman citizen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So the tribune came to Paul and asked him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes," he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"I paid a large sum to get this citizenship," said the tribune. "But I was citizen-born," said Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then those who were about to scourge him, immediately left him. And the tribune too, was afraid, when he learned that Paul was a Roman citizen, for he had had him bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The next day, as he wished to learn the real reason why the Jews accused Paul, he unbound him, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together, and brought Paul down, and placed him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
