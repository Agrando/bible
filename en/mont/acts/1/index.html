"Of this,"  he said, "you have heard from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"For John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So, when they came together, they began to ask him, "Master, are you at this time about to restore the kingdom of Israel?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He answered. "It is not for you to know times and occasions which the Father has fixed in his own authority;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"yet you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you are to be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and to the very ends of the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When he had said this, and while they were looking at him, he was lifted up, and a cloud received him up out of their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>While they were gazing into the sky as he was going up, suddenly there were two men in white garments standing by them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they said. "Men of Galilee, why do you stand gazing into the sky? This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into the sky will come back in just the same way as you have seen him going into the sky."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet,  which is near Jerusalem, about a Sabbath Days journey distant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>On entering the city they went to the upper room where they were accustomed to meet. They were Peter and John and James and Andrew,  Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, son of Alphaeus,  and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These all with one mind gave their constant attention to prayer,  together with some women, and with Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It was during these days that Peter stood up among the brothers - the whole number of persons present was about one hundred and twenty - and said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Men and brothers, it was necessary for the Scripture to be fulfilled which the Holy Spirit uttered beforehand by the lips of David in regard to Judas who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"For he was numbered among us, and he did get his allotted share of this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Now this man bought a plot of ground with the price of his treachery, and falling there headlong he burst asunder and all his bowels gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"This fact became known to the people of Jerusalem so that the place was called in their language, Acheldamach, The Field of Blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"For it is written in the Book of Psalms, Let his dwelling-place be desolate; Let no man dwell there, also, Let another take his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"It is necessary then that, of the men who have been associated with us during the whole time in which the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>from his baptism by John down to the day on which he was taken up from us, one should join us a witness to his resurrection."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So they placed two in nomination, Joseph called Bar-Sabbas (surnamed Justas) and Matthias;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they prayed, saying. "Thou, O Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show clearly which of these two men thou hast chosen to fill the place</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"in this ministry of this apostles from which Judas went out to go to his own place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then they cast lots for them, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
