For I did not lead an idle or disorderly life among you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I did not eat my food as a gift from any man, but in toil and travail, night and day, I worked, so that I might not be a burden to any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Not that I have no right to such support; it was simply to give you an example for you to imitate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For indeed when I was with you, I used to charge you, "If any man will not work, he shall not eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I hear that there are those of your number who are leading idle and disorderly lives, who are not busy, but mere busybodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now all such I command and entreat, by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ, to work in quietness. and to earn their own living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you, brothers, must not grow weary in well-doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man does not give heed to what I have said in this letter,  mark that man; do not associate with him, so as to make him feel ashamed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and yet do not count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I, Paul, add this greeting in my own handwriting, which is my token in every letter.
