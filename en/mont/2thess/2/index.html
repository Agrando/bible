For it will not come until after the Great Apostasy, and the revealing of the Man of Sin, the son of perdition,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>the adversary, who opposes and exalts himself against all that is called God, or is an object of worship; so that he takes his seat in the Temple of God, and vaunts himself as God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do you not recall that I often told you this, when I was with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now you know what is holding him back, to the end that he may be revealed in his appointed time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only there is one who is hindering and will continue to hinder till he be removed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and then the lawless one will be revealed. Him the Lord will consume with the breath of his lips, and destroy with the brightness of his appearing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>even he whose coming is according to the energy of Satan, in every power and sign and lying wonder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and with all deceit of unrighteousness for those who are perishing,  because they did not receive the love of the truth for their salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this reason God is sending on them an energy of delusion, that they should put faith in a falsehood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that they all should be condemned, who are faithless to the truth, but take pleasure in evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But for you, brothers, whom the Lord loves, I ought to give thanks to God continually, because God has chosen you from the beginning for salvation in consecration of the Spirit and belief of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this he called you through my gospel, so that you might obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So, brothers, stand fast, and hold fast the teachings which you have been taught by me, whether by word of mouth or by letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal encouragement and a good hope in grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>comfort your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
