"O brood of vipers! Who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then bring forth fruit worthy of repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And do not presume to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father-I tell you that out of these very stones God is able to raise up descendants for Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And already the axe is lying at the roots of the trees. Any tree,  therefore, that does not bear good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I indeed am baptizing you in water, unto repentance; but One is coming after me, mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and in fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His winnowing-fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse the threshing-floor.

"It is I," he said, "who need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus answered, "Permit it now, for so it is fitting for us to fulfill every religious duty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he consented. And after Jesus was baptized, as soon as he rose out of the water, lo! the heavens opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>while a voice from heaven said, "This is my son, the beloved, In whom I delight."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
