"In the evening you say, It will be fine weather, for the sky is red as fire;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and at dawn you say, It will storm today, for the sky is red and lowering. You know how to discern the look of the sky, but the signs of the times you cannot read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A wicked and faithless generation is seeking a sign, but no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah." So he left them and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When his disciples reached the other side of the lake, they had forgotten to bring bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Presently Jesus said to them, "Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, "It is because we did not bring any bread."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Jesus knew it he said. "Weaklings in faith! Why are you arguing among yourselves, because you have no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many large basketfuls you took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Nor the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many large basketfuls you took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"How is it that you do not perceive that I did not speak to you concerning bread? But beware off the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they realized that he had not told them to beware of the leaven, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus came into the neighborhood of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of man is?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They replied, "Some say Johnthe Baptist;others, however, say that He is Elijah;others, Jeremiah, or One of the Prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"And who do you say that I am?" he asked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Blessed are you, Simon, Son of Jonah," said Jesus; "for flesh and blood have not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Moreover I say to you that you are Petros (a rock), and on this petra (rock) I will build my church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind upon the earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose upon earth shall be loosed in the heavens."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he enjoined his disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After this Jesus the Christ began to show his disciples how he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things at the hands of the elders and chief priests and Scribes, and be put to death, and on the third day be raised again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Peter took him aside and began to reprove him, saying. "God forbid, Master! That shall never befall you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he turned and said to Peter. "Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling-block to me, because you are not intent on what pleases God, but what pleases men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples. "If any man wishes to come after me, let him renounce self, take up his cross, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he who wants to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?  or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of man is about to come in the glory of his Father, and his angels with him, and then will he reward each one in accordance with his actions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Solemnly I tell you, some of those who are standing here shall not taste death, till they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
