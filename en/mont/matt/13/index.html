"Behold," he said, "the sower went forth to sow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and as he sowed, some seed fell by the roadside, and the birds came and ate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Some fell on rocky ground where there was not much earth. Now because it had no depth of soil, it sprang up at once;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but when the sun rose it was scorched, and withered away because it had no root.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But some fell on good soil, and bore a crop, some a hundredfold,  some sixty, some thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who has ears, let him hear!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now when his disciples came up to him, they said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Why do you speak to them in parables?" Jesus answered. "To you it has been granted to understand the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but to them it has not been granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"For whoever holds, to him shall more be given, and he shall have abundance; but whoever does not hold, from him shall be taken away even what he holds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And in them is being fulfilled that prophecy of Isaiah which says.  "Hearing you will hear and not understand; Seeing you will see and not perceive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the heart of his people is made fat, Their ears are dull of hearing; Their eyes, too, have they closed, Lest some day their eyes should perceive, And their ears should hear, And their heart should understand and turn, And I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"But happy are your eyes, because they see, and your ears because they hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"In solemn truth I tell you that many prophets and holy men have seen it not, and to hear what you are hearing, and have not heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Listen then, to the parable of the sower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Whenever any one hears the message of the kingdom, and does not understand it, the Evil One comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"This is the seed sown by the wayside. And the word, and at once receives it with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"But he has no root in himself; he continues for a time, but when trouble arises, or persecutions, on account of the word, at once he stumbles and falls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"And the seed sown among thorns is he who hears the word, but the anxieties of the age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word,  and it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"But the seed sown in good soil is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit, and makes now an hundredfold,  now sixty, now thirty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven," he said, "is like a man who sowed good seed in his field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"but while men were asleep his enemy came and sowed tares among his wheat and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"And when the blade shot up and formed the wheat-kernel, then the tares also appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"The slaves of the owner went to him and said. "Was it not good seed, sir, that you sowed in your field? From whence then, do you get tares?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"It is an enemy who has done this, he answered. "The slaves said to him, Do you want us to go and collect them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"No, he answered, for fear lest while you are collecting the tares, you at the same time pull up the wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"Let both grow together until harvest, and at harvest-time I will tell the reapers to first gather the tares and tie them in bundles for burning, but to bring all the wheat into my store-house."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He set forth to them another parable, saying. "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard-seed which a man took and planted in his field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"This is indeed the smallest of seeds, but when it is grown it is greater than any herb, and becomes a tree, so that the winged things of the sky come and roost in its branches."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He told them another parable. He said, "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of flour,  until the whole was leavened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus told all this to the crowd in parables; indeed he never spoke to them except in parables,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>in fulfilment of the word spoken by the prophet, I will open my mouth in parables, I will utter things kept secret since the foundation of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>After he had sent the people away and gone into the house, his disciples came to him and said, "Explain to us the parable about the weeds in the field."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"The sower of the seed," he answered, "is the Son of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"the field is the world; the good seed is the sons of the kingdom;  the weeds, the sons of the Evil One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"The enemy who sows the weeds is the Devil. The harvest is the end of the age. The reapers are the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"Just as the weeds are collected together and burnt with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"The son of man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all hindrances, and whoever practises iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"and will throw them into the fiery furnace. There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"And then shall the just shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Let him who has ears to hear, listen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure buried in the ground,  which a man finds but buries again, and then in his joy goes and sells all that he has and buys that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of beautiful pearls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"When he finds one of great price, he goes and sells everything he has and buys it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"When it was full they hauled it upon the beach, and sat down and sorted the good fish into baskets, but threw the worthless fish away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>"So will it be at the end of the age. The angels will go forth and separate the wicked from the righteous, and fling them into the furnace of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>"There shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"Have you understood all this?" he asked. "We have," they answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>"Then," said he, "every scribe who has been instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his storehouse new things and old."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>After Jesus had finished these parables, he withdrew from that place,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>and came into his own country, where he continued teaching the people in their synagogues, until they were amazed. "Where did he get such wisdom?" they said, "and such wondrous powers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>"Is not this the carpenters son? Is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers Jamesand Joseph and Simon and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>"Are not his sisters all living among us? Where, then, did he get all these powers?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>This kept them from believing in him. Wherefore Jesus said, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and among his own family."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And he did no mighty works there, because of their lack of faith.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
