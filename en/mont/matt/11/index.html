If not, what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those who wear soft raiment dwell in kings  palaces!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"But why did you go? To see a prophet? I tell you, yes, and more than a prophet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"for this is he of whom it is written. "Behold, I send my messenger before my face, And he will prepare thy road for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"In solemn truth I tell you that there has not arisen among those born of women a greater than Johnthe Baptist; yet one of the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"From the days of Johnthe Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by storm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"For the prophets and the Law prophesied until John;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"and, if you are willing to receive it, he is the Elijah who was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Let all who have ears, listen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"To what shall I compare this generation? It is like little children sitting in the market-place, who call to the other children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"saying. We have piped to you and you have not danced; We have wailed, but you have not beaten your breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"For Johncame neither eating nor drinking, and they said, He has a demon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Lo, a glutton and a wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners!  Nevertheless, Wisdom is justified by her deeds."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they had not repented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Woe unto you, Chorazin! Woe unto you, Bethsaida! Because if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented, long ago, in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Moreover, I tell you it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the Day of Judgment, than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"And you too, Capernaum! Will you be exalted even to heaven? You shall go down to the Place of Death! For if the mighty works had been done in Sodom which have been done in you, it would have remained until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the Day of Judgment, than for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said. "I praise thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hidden these things from the wise and wary, and hast revealed them to the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Everything has been handed over to me by my Father; neither does any one know the Son, except the Father, nor any one know the Father except the Son, and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Come unto me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
