This perfume could have been sold for a good sum, and the money given to the poor."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when Jesus understood it he said to them. "Why are you annoying the woman? This is a beautiful deed she has done for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"for the poor you have with you always, but me you will not always have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"In pouring this perfume on my body, she was preparing me for my burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"In solemn truth I tell you that wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, what she has done shall be told about,  as her memorial."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It was then that one of the Twelve, he who was called Judas Iscariot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>went to the chief priests and said, "What are you ready to give me for betraying him to you?" So they weighed him thirty pieces of silver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and from that time he kept looking for a chance to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Where do you want us to make preparation for you eat the Passover?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Go into the city," he answered, "to a certain man, and tell him.  "The Teacher says. "My time is near. I am going to keep the Passover at your house, with my disciples.""</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The disciples did as Jesus told them, and made ready the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When evening came he reclined at table with the Twelve;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and as they were eating, he said to them, "In solemn truth I tell you that one of you is going to betray me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In deep distress they began to ask him, each in turn, "It is not I,  is it, Master?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In reply he said. "One who has dipped his hand with me in the dish will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"The Son of man is indeed to go as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were good for that man if he had never been born."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In answer, Judas, who betrayed him, said, "Surely it is not I,  Rabbi?" He said to him, "Is it not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and, when he had blessed it, he broke it and gave to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat, this is my body."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he had taken the cup and given thanks, he gave it to them,  saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the Covenant,  which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"But I say to you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So after singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them. "This very night even you will all stumble and fall away from me; for it is written, "I will smite the shepherd,  and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am raised up I will go before you into Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"If they all stumble and fall away from you," answered Peter, "I will never do so!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, "In solemn truth I tell you that on this very night, before cockcrow, you will deny me three times!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you." And so said all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, "Sit down here, while I go and pray yonder."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and began to be in anguish and sore distress,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and he said to them. "My soul is an anguish, even unto death! Stay here, and keep watch with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then he went forward a short distance, and fell on his face and prayed. "O, my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me;  nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he came to his disciples, and found them asleep, and said to Peter. "So you were none of you strong enough to watch with me even one hour!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then he went away again a second time and prayed, saying, "O, my Father, if this cup cannot pass except I drink it, Thy will be done."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he left them and went away again, and prayed the third time in the same words as before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he came to the disciples and said. "Sleep on now, and take your rest. Look! the hour is at hand; the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"Rouse yourselves! Let us go. My betrayer is close at hand!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Barely had he spoken these words when Judas, one of the Twelve,  appeared, accompanied by a great crowd of men with swords and staves,  from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now his betrayer had given them a sign, saying. "Whoever I kiss is the man; arrest him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So he came straight up to Jesus and said, "Hail, Rabbi!" and kissed him eagerly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>"Friend, do that for which you came," said Jesus. Then they came forward and laid hands on Jesus, and arrested him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, behold, one of these who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smote the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to him. "Put back your sword into its place! for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>"Do you not suppose that I am able to appeal to my Father to furnish me at this very moment with twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>"But if I did, how could the Scriptures be fulfilled that say that thus it must happen?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Then Jesus said to the crowds. "Are you come out as against a robber, with swords and staves to arrest me? Day after day, I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not apprehend me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>"But all this has happened in order that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then all his disciples forsook him and fled; but those who had apprehended Jesus led him away to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Now Peter was following him, afar off, as far as the courtyard of the high priest; and when he got in, he was sitting with the officers, to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to get false evidence against Jesus, in order that they might have him executed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>but they found none, although many false witnesses came forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>However, at last two came forward who said, "This fellow declared,  I can destroy the Temple of God and build it in three days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Rising to his feet the high priest asked Jesus. "Do you make no answer? What is it that these are testifying against you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus kept silence. Again the high priest addressed him, "I adjure you by the Living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>"I am He," Jesus answered; "yet I tell you that from this time on you will see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest tore his garments, saying. "He has spoken blasphemy! What further need have we of witnesses? For behold, now you have heard his blasphemy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>"What is your verdict?" "He ought to die," they answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and some struck him with the palms of their hands, and cried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>"Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it who struck you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one of the maidservants came up to him and said, "You also were with Jesus, the Galilean!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied it before them all; "I do not know what you mean," he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Soon afterward he went out into the porch, and another maid saw him,  and said to those who were there, "This fellow certainly was with Jesus, the Nazarene!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied it with an oath, saying, "I never knew the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>A little later the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "You also are certainly one of them, for your speech betrays you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I never knew the man."  Immediately the cock crew!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>Then Peter recalled the word that Jesus had spoken, "Before the cock crow, you shall three times deny me" - and he went out and broke out into bitter weeping.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
