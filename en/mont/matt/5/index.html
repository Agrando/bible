It is henceforth good for nothing but to be thrown out and trodden under foot of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"You are the light of the world. A city built on a hilltop cannot be hid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"nor do men light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the lamp-stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"So let your light shine before men that they may see good you do,  and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Do not suppose that I am come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I am come not to destroy, but to fulfil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"In solemn truth I tell you that until heaven and earth pass away,  not an iota, not a comma, will pass from the Law until all has taken place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"So whoever breaks one of these least commandments, and teaches others to break them, will be least in the kingdom of heaven. But he who keeps them and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"For I assure you that unless your righteousness exceed that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will not find entrance into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "Thou shall not commit murder, and "he who commits murder shall be liable to condemnation by the court;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but I say to you that he who becomes angry with his brother shall be liable to condemnation by the court; and he who says to his brother Raca, shall be liable to condemnation by the Sanhedrin, while he who curses his brother shall be liable to the Gehenna of Fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar, and there remember that your brother has a grievance against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"leave there your gift before the altar, and go and make friends with your brother, first of all; then come and offer your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Come to terms with your opponent quickly, while you are yet with him on the way to the court, to prevent your opponent from handing you over to the judge, and the judge to the jailer, and so you be thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"I tell you truly that you would certainly not get out from there until you had paid back the last cent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"You have heard that it was said, "Thou shalt not commit adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you that whoever looks with lust at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if your eye, your right eye, entices you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs, than to have your whole body go down into the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand entices you into sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of your bodily organs,  than to have your whole body go down into the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"It was also said, "Whoever divorces his wife must give her a bill of separation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, makes her an adulteress, and whoever marries her when so divorced, commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"Again you have heard that it was said to the men of old, "You must not forswear yourselves, but must perform your vows to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"But I say to you, swear not at all; neither by the sky, for it is Gods throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the Great King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Nor must you swear by your head, since you cannot make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"But let your word be simply Yes or No;anything beyond this comes from the Evil One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"But I tell you not to retaliate the injury; but whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him also;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"and if any one wants to go to law with you and takes away your coat, let him take your cloak also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"Whoever impresses you to go one mile, go two miles with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"Give to him who asks, and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"So you will become sons of your heavenly Father; for he makes his sun to rise upon sinners as well as saints, and sends rain upon the unjust and the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>"Even the tax-gatherers do that, do they not? And if you show courtesy to your brother only, what are you doing more than others?  Even the Gentiles do that, do they not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>"You then must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
