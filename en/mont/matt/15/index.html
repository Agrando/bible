Thus do you make void the word of God by your tradition!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This is a people that honors me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In vain do they worship me, While they teach doctrines that are the commands of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus called the people to him and said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Listen, and pay attention. It is not what goes into a mans mouth that defiles him, but what comes out of it, that defiles the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then his disciples came to him and said, "Do you know that the Pharisees were scandalized when they heard that saying?" He replied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Any plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Let them alone. They are blind men leading the blind; and if one blind man leads another, both of them will fall into a ditch."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Peter said to Jesus, "Explain the parable to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He answered. "Are even you still without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Do you not know how all that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is afterward evacuated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>while what comes out of the mouth comes from the heart - and that is what defiles a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murder, adultery,  unchastity, theft, perjury, slander.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things that defile a man; to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus then left that place, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, there came to him a Canaanite woman of those parts. She wailed loudly, saying. "Pity me, Lord, thou Son of David! My daughter is possessed of an evil spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answered her not a word. Then the disciples came up and kept beseeching him. "Send her away," they said, "because she wails after us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In reply he said, "I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the woman came and knelt to him and said, "Lord, do help me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He answered, "It is not seemly to take the childrens bread and throw it to the little dogs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"True, Lord," she said, "but even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered her. "O woman, great is your faith. It shall be for you even as you desire." And from that hour her daughter was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>On leaving that place Jesus went along the shore of the Sea of Galilee; and after climbing a hill, took his seat there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Great crowds came to him, bringing the crippled, the blind, the maimed, the dumb, and many others. They laid them at his feet and he healed them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that the crowd wondered when they saw the dumb speaking, the cripples walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Jesus called his disciples to him and said. "My heart yearns over the crowd, for they have been with me now three days, and they have nothing to eat. I am not willing to send them away hungry, for fear they faint on the road."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"In a lonely place like this," asked the disciple. "where can we get bread enough to satisfy such a crowd?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"How many loaves have you?" answered Jesus. They replied, "Seven,  and a few small fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So when he had summoned the crowd, and seated them upon the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>he took the seven loaves and the fish, and gave thanks, then he broke them and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And all ate and were satisfied, and of the fragments that remained they gathered seven large basketfuls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And those who ate numbered four thousand, besides the women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When he had sent the crowds away, he got into the boat and came into the region of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
