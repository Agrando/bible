"You need have no fear, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the Crucified One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Master was lying!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly and tell his disciples. He is risen from the dead;  he goes before you into Galilee; you will see him there. Remember, I have told you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On this they ran quickly from the sepulcher, in fear and great joy,  to tell the news to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And behold! Jesus himself met them, saying, "All hail!" And they went up to him and clasped his feet and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them. "Fear not! Go tell my brothers to depart into Galilee, and they will see men there."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now while they were on their way, some of the guard went into the city and told the high priest all that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they had met with the elders and conferred together, they heavily bribed the soldiers and told them to say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"His disciples came by night and stole him away, while we were asleep."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"If this should reach the Governors ears," they said, "we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the soldiers took the money, and did as they were told; and this story has been noised abroad among the Jews, and continues to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the eleven disciples went away to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came forward to them and spoke to them, saying. "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe every command which I have given you. and lo! I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
