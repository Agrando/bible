Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Peter said to Jesus. "Master, it is good that we are here! If you are willing I will make here three tents, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While he was yet speaking, behold! a luminous cloud overshadowed them; and a voice out of the cloud, saying. "This is my Son, my Beloved, in whom is my delight. Listen to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus came to them and touched them, saying, "Rise, have no fear!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when they raised their eyes they saw no one save Jesus only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>While they were going down from the mountain, Jesus laid a command on them. "Speak to no man about the vision," he said, "until after the Son of man has been raised from the dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And his disciples asked him, saying, "Why then do the Scribes say that Elijah must first come?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he answered. "Elijah is coming, and will restore all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Nay, I say to you that Elijah has come already, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they chose. Even so the Son of man also is about to suffer at their hands."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples divined that he had been speaking to them about John, the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As they reached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, and fell on his knees before him, saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Master, take pity on my son, for he is an epileptic and sore distressed. Often he falls into the fire and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"And I brought him to your disciples, but they could not cure him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In reply Jesus said. "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I endure you? Bring him here to me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jesus rebuked the evil spirit, and it came out of him; and the boy was cured from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thereupon Jesus disciples came to him and asked him privately, "Why were we not able to cast it out?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Because of your little faith," he answered. "In solemn truth I tell you that if you have faith the size of a mustard-seed, you can say to this mountain, Move from this place to that! and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"But this kind is driven out by prayer alone."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As they continued going from place to place in Galilee, Jesus said to them. "The Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"and they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise again."  And they were greatly grieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As they came into Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked, "Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Indeed he does," answered Peter. But on Peters entering the house,  Jesus forestalled him, saying. "How does it seem to you, Simon? From whom do earthly kings collect customs or taxes-from their own people,  or from aliens?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he replied, "From aliens," Jesus said. "Then their people go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Nevertheless, that we may not give offense, go to the seaside,  throw in your hook; take the first fish that rises, and when you have opened its mouth, you will find a shekel in it. Take it and give it to them for us both."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
