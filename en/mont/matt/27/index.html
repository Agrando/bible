"What is that to us?" they answered; "you must see to that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And flinging down the silver into the Sanctuary, he rushed out, and went and hanged himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The chief priests took the money, and said, "It would be wrong to put it into the temple-treasury, because it is the price of blood."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So after the consultation they bought the Potters Field with it,  for a burial-place for strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is the reason why, to this day, the field is called "The Field of Blood."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then was fulfilled the word spoken by the prophet Jeremiah. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who had been priced, whom certain of the Children of Israel had priced;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and gave them for the Potters Field, as the Lord had appointed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Jesus stood before the Governor, and the Governor questioned him. "Are you the King of the Jews?" he asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"it is as you say," answered Jesus; but while he was being accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear what they are testifying against you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he made no answer, not even to one charge; insomuch that the Governor was greatly astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now it was the Governors custom, during the Passover, to release to the people any one prisoner whom they selected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time they had a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So when they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He knew well that it was because of enmity that they had brought Jesus before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And while he was seated upon the judgment-seat, his wife had sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered many things today, in a dream, because of him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the chief priests and the elders urged the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to destroy Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So when Pilate said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release unto you?" they said, "Barabbas."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Pilate asked, "What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ?" What one voice they shouted, "Let him be crucified!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Pilate said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they kept shouting the more fiercely, "Let him be crucified!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but that on the contrary a riot was threatening, he took water and washed his hands in the presence of the crowd, saying. "I am innocent of the blood of this man; you must answer for it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>All the people answered, "His blood be upon us and upon our children."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he released Barabbas to them, but Jesus he scourged, and delivered to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the soldiers of the Governor took Jesus into the Praetorium,  and gathered all the battalion together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they twisted a thorny crown for him, and put it on his head, and placed a reed in his right hand. Then they knelt before him, in mockery, crying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they spit upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head, again and again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At last, when they had finished their mocking, they took the robe off, and put his own garments on him, and led him away to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And as they went out they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name, whom they compelled to go with them to carry his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (the word means "Place of a Skull"),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they gave Jesus wine to drink, mingled with gall. But after tasting it he refused to drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>After crucifying him, they parted his garments among them by casting lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then they sat and watched him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They also placed above his head his accusation written, This is Jesus The King of the Jews</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>At that time two robbers, also, were crucified with him; one on his right hand, the other on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Those who passed by reviled him, wagging their heads saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"You who were going to destroy the Temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>In like manner the chief priests, too, with the Scribes and elders,  kept taunting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"He saved other," they said, "himself he cannot save. He, the King of Israel! Let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He put his trust in God. let Him deliver him now, if He cares for him. For he said, I am the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>In the same way the robbers also who were being crucified with him,  dept reviling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from noon darkness fell upon the whole land, until three oclock in the afternoon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But at three oclock Jesus cried out in loud voice, "Eli, Eli, Lama Sabachthani?" (That is to say, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?")</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When they heard this, some of the bystanders said "He is calling for Elijah!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>At once, one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filling it with vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But the rest said. "Let be! Let us see whether Elijah is coming to save him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And lo, the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two, from the top to the bottom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>the earth quaked; the rocks split; the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And coming forth out of the tombs, after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When the Roman captain and the soldiers who were with him, guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and all that happened, they were greatly terrified and said, "Certainly this man must have been Gods Son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And there were present several women who were looking on from a distance; they had followed Jesus from a Galilee, ministering to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>among them being Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jamesand Joses,  and the mother of Zebedees sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>When it was eventide, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Josephus, who was himself a disciple of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Pilate then commanded that it be given over to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock; and after rolling a great stone against the opening of the tomb, he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>The day after - that is, the day following the Preparation - the chief priests and Pharisees went in a body to Pilate and said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>"We recollect, Sir, that when he was living this imposter said, I will rise again after three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Now therefore give order to have the sepulcher securely guarded until the third day, for fear his disciples may come and steal him away, and then tell the people, He is risen from the dead;and so the last error will be worse than the first."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>"You can have a guard," said Pilate. "Go your way, make it as secure as you can."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>So they went and made the sepulcher secure, by sealing the stone in the presence of the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
