Go out to meet him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Then all those maidens rose and trimmed their lamps;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"and the foolish said to the wise, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Not so, answered the wise, for there may not be enough for you and for us. Go to the shops, rather, and buy some for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"And while they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding-feast. And the door was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Afterwards the other maidens came and cried, "Lord, Lord, open unto us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"In solemn truth I tell you, he replied, I know you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Be watchful then, for you know neither the day nor the hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"For it is like a man going into another country, who summoned his slaves, and committed his property to their care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another, one -  to each according to his individual ability - and then set out on his travels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"At once the man who had received the five talents went out and traded with them, and made five talents more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"In the same way the one who got two talents made another two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"But he who had received the one talent went off, and dug a hole in the ground, and hid his masters money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"After a long time the master of those slaves came, and demanded a reckoning with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"The man who had received the five talents came, bringing five more,  and said. "Master, five talents you entrusted to me; see, I have gained five more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Well done, good and faithful slave, replied his master; You have been faithful over many things. Enter into your masters joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"The second, who had received the two talents, came up and said.  "Master, it was two talents that you entrusted to me; see, I have gained two more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Well done, good and faithful slave, his master replied, You have been faithful over many things; enter into your masters joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Then the man who had received the one talent came up and said.  "Master, I knew you were a hard man, reaping where you had not sown,  and gathering where you had not scattered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"so I was afraid; I went away and buried your talent in the earth.  There, you have what belongs to you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"You wicked and lazy slave, said his master. You say you knew that I reap where I have not sowed, and gather where I have not scattered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Then you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my property with interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"So take away the talent from him, and give it to the man who has ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"(For to every one who has, it shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from him who has not shall be taken away even what he has.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"But cast out the worthless slave into the outer darkness; there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then will he take his seat on the throne of his glory;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"and all the nations will be gathered in his presence. And he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>"and he will place the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>"Then he, the King will say to those on his right hand. "Come, my Fathers blessed ones, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"For I was hungry, and you gave me food; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"I was naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>"Then shall the righteous answer him, saying. Master, when did we see you hungry and feed you; or thirsty and give you drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"When did we see you a stranger and take you in; or naked and clothe you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"When did we see you sick or in prison, and come to see you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"In solemn truth I tell you, the King will answer them, that inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these, my brothers, you have done it unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>"Then he will say to those also at his left hand. Depart from me,  accursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"for I was hungry, and you gave me no food; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"I was a stranger, and you took me not in; naked, and you clothed me not; sick, or in prison, and you visited me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"Then will they also answer, Master, when did we ever see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,  and did not minister to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"But he will reply, In solemn truth I tell you that inasmuch as you did not do it unto one of these least, you did not do it unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>"And these will go away into eternal punishment; but the righteous into eternal life."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
