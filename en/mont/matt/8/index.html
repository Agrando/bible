To one man I say Go, and he goes; to another,Come,  and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As Jesus listened to this reply he was astonished, and said to those who followed him. "In solemn truth I tell you that I have found faith like this in any Israelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west, and sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"but the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; there will be the wailing and the gnashing of teeth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus said to the captain. "Go! As you have believed, so be it unto you." And his slave was healed in that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus came into Peters house, he found his wifes mother prostrated with fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and waited upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At evening-time they brought to him many demoniacs. He cast out the demons with a word, and healed all who were ill,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that the word spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,  He took upon himself our weaknesses, and bore the burden of our diseases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When Jesus saw the great crowds about him, he had given directions to cross to the other side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>when a Scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Foxes have their holes," answered Jesus, "and wild birds their roosting-places, but the Son of man has not where to lay his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Follow me," Jesus said to him, "and leave the dead to bury their own dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he went in board a fishing-boat, his disciples accompanying him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and behold, a sudden storm arose on the sea, so that the boat began to be buried by the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he was asleep. And they came and woke him, saying. "Lord save us! We are drowning!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"Why are you afraid?" he said, "you men of little faith!" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there came a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the men were amazed, saying, "What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When he arrived on the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes,  he was met by two demoniacs who were coming out of the tombs. They were so violently fierce that no one dared pass along that road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"You Son of God," they shouted, "what have you to do with us? Are you come to torment us before the time?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now there was, at some distance from them, a herd of many swine feeding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the demons began entreating him. "If you are driving us out,"  they said, "send us into the herd of swine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He answered, "Go!" So they came out of the men, and went into the swine, and behold! the entire herd rushed headlong down from the cliff into the sea, and perished in the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The swineherds fled. They went away into the city and told all about it, and what had befallen the demoniacs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>At once all the citizens came out to meet Jesus; and when they had seen him, they begged him to move away from their country.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
