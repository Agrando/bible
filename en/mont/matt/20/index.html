Again at noon, and about three oclock, he went out and did the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"When he went out about five oclock, he found others standing around, and said to them, "Why have you been standing here idle, all the day long?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Because no one has hired us, they replied. "He said to them, Do you also go into the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"And when evening came, the Lord of the vineyard said to his steward, "Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning with the last hired and ending with the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"When those came who had begun at five oclock, they received two shillings apiece;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"and when the first came they supposed that they would get more, but they also received each two shillings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"And as they took it they began to grumble against the master of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Those last men, they said, have toiled only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the burning heat of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"In reply he said to one of them. My friend, I am doing no wrong.  Did you not agree with me for two shillings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Take your wage and begone! I chose to give to this last man the same as to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Have I not the right to do what I choose with my own property? Or is your eye evil because I am generous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"So the last shall be first, and the first, last."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve aside by themselves, and as they went he said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Look! We are on the way up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"and hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified; and on the third day he will rise from the grave."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons,  kneeling down and begging a favor of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"What is it you wish?" he said. She answered, "Command that these my two sons may sit upon your right hand and your left in your kingdom."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"None of you indeed shall drink," he answered, "but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When the ten heard of this, they were indignant at the two brothers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but Jesus called them to him and said. "You know how the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Not so shall it be among you. But whoever among you wishes to become great, shall be your minister,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"and whoever wishes to be first among you, shall be your slave;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"just as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life as a ransom for many."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now as they were leaving Jericho a great crowd followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And two blind men, sitting by the side of the road, heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, and cried out, "Have pity on us,  Master, Son of David!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the crowd checked them, to make them keep still. They cried out all the louder, saying, "Master, have pity on us, Son of David!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus stopped and called to them, "What do you want me to do for you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"Master," they answered, "let our eyes be opened."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and they saw at once, and followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
