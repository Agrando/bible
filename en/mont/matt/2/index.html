For we have seen his star in the East, and are come to worship him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When King Herod heard this he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So when he had gathered together all the chief priests and rabbis of the people, he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they told him. "At Bethlehem in Judea, as it is written in the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah, Thou are not least among the princes of Judah, For out of thee shall come a ruler Who shall shepherd my people, Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thereupon Herod sent secretly for the Magi, and found out from them the time when the star appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and make careful inquiry about the child, and as soon as you have found him bring me word,  that I, too, may go and worship him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Magi listened to the king, and went on their way, and lo! the star which they had seen in the east led them until it came and stood over the place where the young child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with great gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they had entered the house, they saw the child with Mary, his mother, and opening their treasure-chests they gave him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But because they were forbidden by God in a dream to go back to Herod, they returned to their own country by another route.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When they were gone an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying; "Rise! Take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt, and there remain until I bring you word; for Herod intends to make a search for the child, in order to put him to death."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Joseph arose, took the child and his mother, by night, and departed to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There he remained until the death of Herod, in order that the word of the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, which says, Out of Egypt I called my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As soon as Herod saw that he had been mocked by the Magi, he was furious. He sent and put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and all the neighborhood who were two years old or under, in accordance with the date which he had ascertained from the Magi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then were fulfilled the words spoken through Jeremiah, the prophet,  saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A voice was heard in Ramah, Weeping and lamentation- Rachel weeping for her children, Inconsolable, because they were no more!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But after Herods death an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, "Rise! Take the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he rose and took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning in Judea in place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there; and being warned of God in a dream, he withdrew into Galilee and settled in a town called Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>in fulfillment of the word spoken through the Prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
