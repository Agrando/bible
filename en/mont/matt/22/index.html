Tell the invited guests, he said,  that my luncheon is now ready; my oxen and fat cattle are killed;  everything is ready; come to the wedding-feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"They, however, paid no attention, but went off, one to his own farm, another to his business;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"while the rest seized his slaves and maltreated and murdered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Then the kings wrath was roused, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Then he said to his slaves, "The wedding-feast indeed is ready,  but the invited guests were not worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"So go out into the partings of the highways, and summon everybody you find there to the wedding-feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"So those slaves went out into the roads, and gathered together all whom they found, good or bad, and the banquet-hall was filled with the guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"Then the king came in to inspect his guests, and he discovered there a man who had not put on a wedding-garment. He said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding-garment? "The man was speechless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Bind him hand and foot, said the king to his officers, and cast him into the outer darkness; there will be the wailing and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"For there are many called, but few are chosen."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went and took counsel how they might ensnare him during conversation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they sent their disciples to him, with the Herodians. "Teacher,"  they said, "we know that you are honest, and that you are teaching the way of God in sincerity; and are not afraid of any one, for you do not court mens favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Give us your advice, then. Is it allowable to pay taxes to Caesar,  or not?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus, because he knew their malice, said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Hypocrites! Why are you tempting me? Show me the tribute money." So they brought him a shilling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>"Whose likeness and inscription is this?" he asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Caesars," they answered. Then he said to them, "Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars, and unto God the things that are Gods."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they heard this they were astonished, and left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>That very day there came to him some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection. and they questioned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Master," they said, "Moses taught that if a man dies without issue,  his brother is to marry the widow, and raise up a family for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Now there were of our number seven brothers; and the first married and died. As he had no children, he left his wife to his brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"In the same way the second also died, and the third, unto the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Last of all the woman died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be? They all had her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In answer Jesus said. "You err because you do not know the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"For in the resurrection men do not marry, nor are women given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"But concerning the resurrection of the dead, did you never read what was spoken to you by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>"I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the crowds heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As soon as the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and one of them, a lawyer, tested him by asking a question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>"Master, which is the great commandment in the law?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus answered, "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>"This is the great and first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>"The second, which is like it, is this, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>"On those two commandments hang the whole law and the prophets."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now while the Pharisees were together, Jesus put this question to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>"What is your opinion concerning the Christ? Whose Son is he?"  "Davids," they answered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>"How then, "he said, "does David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand Until I put thine enemies beneath thy feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>"If David calls him Lord, how can he be his Son?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>No one could answer him a word, nor did any one dare from that day to ask him another question.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
