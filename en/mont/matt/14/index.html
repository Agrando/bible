That is why miraculous powers are working through him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For Herod had apprehended John, shackled him, and thrust him into prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philips wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because Johnkept telling him, "It is not right for you to have her."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And although he wished to kill John, he feared the people, for they considered Johna prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when Herods birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and so pleased Herod that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So, prompted by her mother, the girl said, "Give me at once, upon a dish, the head of Johnthe Baptist."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The king was displeased because of this, but because of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He sent and beheaded Johnin prison;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>the head was brought on a dish, and given to the young girl, who took it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Johns disciples went and removed his body, and came and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Jesus heard it he went away privately by boat to a lonely spot;  but the crowds heard about it, and followed him on foot from the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So when he landed he saw a great multitude, and felt compassion for them, and healed their sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As twilight fell, his disciples came to him and said. "This is a lonely spot, and the day is far spent; send the crowds away, so that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"They need not go away," said Jesus, "do you, yourselves, give them something to eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"We have nothing here," they replied, "except five loaves and two fishes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Bring them here to me," said Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he told the people to sit down on the grass, and after taking the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves and handed them to the disciples, and the disciples handed them to the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they all ate and were fully satisfied, and they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve basketfuls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Those who had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he made his disciples get aboard the boat and precede him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After he had sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountain alone, to pray. When night came he was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the boat was already a long way from shore, buffeted by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the fourth watch of the night he came toward them, walking upon the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but when the disciples saw him walking upon the sea, they were terrified. "It is a phantom," they said, and cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But at once Jesus spoke to them, "Courage," he said, "it is I. Fear not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter answered, "Master, if it is you, bid me come to you upon the water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Come," said Jesus. Then Peter got down from the boat and walked on the water to go to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and as he began to sink, he cried out, "Master, save me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At once Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, saying to him. "O little faith! What made you doubt?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then as they climbed into the boat the wind grew weary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the men in the boat fell upon their knees before him, saying,  "You are, indeed, the Son of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then they crossed over and came to land at Gennesaret;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and when the men of that country recognized him, they sent into all the country round about, and brought to him all the sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and kept begging him to let them touch the tassel of his cloak - and all who touched were completely cured.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
