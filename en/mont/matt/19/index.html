Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They answered, "Why then did Moses command the husband to give her a written bill of divorce, and so to put her away?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Moses," said Jesus, "permitted you to divorce your wives on account of the hardness of your hearts, but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"And I tell you that any man who divorces his wife for any cause except her unfaithfulness, and marries another woman, commits adultery."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"If that is the position of a man in relation to his wife," answered the disciples, "it is better not to marry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered them. "Not all are accepting this teaching, but only those to whom it has been granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"For there are eunuchs who have been such from birth; others who have been made such by men; and others who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of God. He who is able to receive this, let him receive it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then young children were brought to him, that he might lay his hands on them and pray. His disciples interfered, but Jesus said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Let the little children come to me, and forbid them not; for it is to the childlike that the kingdom of heaven belongs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he laid his hands upon them, and departed from that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But look! a certain man came up to him and asked, "Teacher, what good thing shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"Why do you ask me about what is good?" asked Jesus. "There is but One who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"Which commandments?" asked the man. Jesus replied. "Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal; Thou shalt not bear false witness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man answered. "I have carefully kept them all. What yet do I lack?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"If you want to be perfect," said Jesus, "go, sell your property,  give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come,  follow me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard this teaching, he went away sorrowful,  for he was one who had much property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Jesus said to his disciples. "In solemn truth I tell you that a rich man will find it difficult to enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"I tell you again, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they heard this the disciples were utterly astounded. "Who then can be saved?" they exclaimed. Jesus looked at them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"With men this is impossible," he said, "but with God all things are possible."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whereupon Peter said to Jesus. "Look, Master, we have forsaken everything and followed you. Now what shall be our reward?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"In solemn truth I tell you," Jesus answered, "that in the New Creation, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory,  you also who have followed me shall sit on twelve thrones, to govern the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"And every one who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my sake, shall many times as much, and fall heir to eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>"But many who are first shall be last, and many who are last shall be first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
