First cast out the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly how to cast the mote out of your brothers eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Do not give what is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine; lest in turn they trample them under their feet, and then turn and attack you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks the door is opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"What man of you is there who, when his son asks a loaf, will give him a stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"or if his son asks for a fish, will offer him a snake?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"If you then, evil as you are, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good gifts to those who ask him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Therefore everything that you would have men do to you, do you also the same to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Enter by the narrow gate; for broad is the gate and wide the road that leads to destruction, and many are they who go in by it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"but the gate is narrow and the road is steep, which leads to life,  and they are few who find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheeps clothing,  but within they are ravening wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"By their fruits you will know them.
