Now your abundance at this present time present time is a supply for their want, in supply for your want; and so burdens be equalized,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>even as it is written, He who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little did not lack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But thanks be to God who has inspired in the heart of Titus the same zeal on your behalf that I have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he not only consented to my request, but being thoroughly in earnest, comes to you of his own accord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I am sending with him that brother whose fame in the service of the gospel is spread through all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>More than that, he is the one chosen by the churches to accompany me on my journey, in administering this gift of yours for the Lords glory. And this has my full consent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because I am on my guard in this, that no one should blame me, in respect to this bounty which I am administering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I aim at being above reproach, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>With them I am sending our brother of whose zeal I have often had proof in many ways, and who is now zealous because of his great confidence in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As for Titus, remember that he is a partner of mine, and is also my associate in labors for you. As for the other brothers, remember that they are delegates from the churches, men in whom Christ is glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So show to the churches an evidence of your love, and a justification to these brothers of my boasting about you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
