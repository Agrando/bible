I want it to be given of your bounty, not extorted from your covetousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Mark this; he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But let each give according to the purpose of his heart; not grudgingly of under compulsion. It is a cheerful giver that God loves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God is able to give you an overflowing measure of every grace,  so that all your wants of every kind may be supplied at all times,  and you may give of your abundance to every good work;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As it is written. He scattered broadcast, he gave to the poor; His almsgiving continues forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who ever supplies seed to the sower, and bread for the food of man, will supply and make plentous your seed, and increase the harvest springing up from your almsgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You yourselves will be enriched with all good things, that you may give ungrudgingly; and your gifts, of which I am the agent, will make men give thanks to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Because the ministry of this contribution not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also overflows in many a thanksgiving to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this ministration proves you. On account of it men glorify God for your faithfulness to your professions of the gospel of Christ,  and for the liberality of your gifts to them and to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover, in their prayers for you they will be longing after you,  because of the exceeding grace of God that is resting upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>THANKS BE TO GOD FOR HIS UNSPEAKABLE GIFT!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
