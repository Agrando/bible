Did Titus make gain of you? And did I not walk in the same spirit as he did? Did I not take the very same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I know a Christian man who, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body, I know not. God knows), was caught up-  -this man of whom I speak - even into the third heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I know such a man (whether in the body or apart from the body I know not, God knows),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who was caught up into Paradise, and heard unutterable words which no human being is permitted to utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Of such a one I will boast; but on my own behalf I will not boast except in my weaknesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If I should choose to continue boasting I should not be foolish, for I should be speaking the truth. But I refrain, lest by the stupendous grandeur of the revelation any one should estimate me beyond what he sees in me, or hears from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It was for this reason, lest I should be over-elated, that there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me,  lest I should be over-elated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Concerning this, three times over I supplicated the Lord that it might leave me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but he has answered me. "My grace is sufficient for you; it is in weakness that my power is perfected."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Most gladly therefore will I boast rather of my weakness, that over me like a tent may be pitched the power of Christ. That is why I rejoice in weakness, in ill-treatment, in troubles, in persecutions and calamities for Christs sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am become a fool - you have forced me to; for you yourselves ought to have been my vindicators. In no respect am I inferior to these superapostolic apostles, even though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In truth the signs of the true apostle were wrought among you in all patience by signs and marvels and powers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In what respect, then, were you inferior to the other churches,  except that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And now for the third time I am preparing to visit you. I will not be a burden to you, for I am not seeking yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For my part, I will most gladly spend, yea, and will myself be spent, for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I to be loved the less?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But though it be granted that I was not a burden to you, yet, you say, this was my cunning with which I caught you by a trick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I make gain of you through any of those whom I sent to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do you think that all this time I am defending myself to you? It is before the presence of God that I am speaking in Christ; and all,  beloved, for your upbuilding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I dread that perhaps, when I come, I may not find you to be such as I wish, and that I may be found by you such as you do not wish; I dread lest there should be quarrels, jealousy, tempers, party spirit,  slandering, gossip, arrogance, tumults;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and lest when I come again my God may humble me before you, and lest I shall mourn for many those who have sinned before, and have not repented of the impurity and immorality and wantonness which they have practised.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
