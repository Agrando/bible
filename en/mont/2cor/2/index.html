So I bade them good-bye and started off for Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But thanks be to God, who in every place is leading me in the train of Christs triumph, and is making manifest through me the knowledge of him, an odor of incense everywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I am Christs fragrance upwafted unto God, among those who are being saved and those who are perishing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to these latter an odor of death to death, to the former, of life to life. For such service as this, who is sufficient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I am; for I am not like most, trafficking in the word of God, but rather from a sincere heart, like a man of God, I speak in Christ, in the very presence of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
