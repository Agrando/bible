What I am is manifest to God, and I hope manifest also to your conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I am not "commending myself to you again," but I am giving you an occasion of boasting on my behalf, so that you may have an answer ready for those who boast in externals, and not in the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if I was "beside myself," it was to God; of if I am now "of sound mind," it is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the love of Christ overmasters me; because I thus judge that if One has died for all, then all have died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and that he died for all in order that the living may live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died and rose again for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore henceforth I know no one simply as a man - even if I have known Christ as a man, yet now I do so no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So there is a new creation when any man is in Christ. The old life has passed away, behold, the new is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all this is from God, who through Christ reconciled me to himself, and gave me the ministry of reconciliation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>how that God was in Christ reconciling a world to himself, not reckoning to men their trespasses; and that to me he has entrusted the message of that reconciliation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On Christs behalf, then, I come as ambassador. It is as though God was entreating you, through me, on Christs behalf I beg you to be reconciled to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Him who knew no sin, in our behalf he has made to be sin; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
