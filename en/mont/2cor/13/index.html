Out of the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be confirmed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have said formerly, and I now forewarn you as when I was present the second time, so now when I am absent the second time, so now when I am absent, saying to those who had sinned before, and to all the rest, "If I come again, I will not spare,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Since you want a proof of Christ who is speaking in me, he who is not feeble toward you, but powerful among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he now lives through the power of God. I also am weak, sharing in his weakness,  but I shall live with him by the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Examine yourselves to see if you are in the faith; put your own selves to the proof. Or do you not know, your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed you fail to abide the proof?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I hope you will find that I abide the proof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And my prayer to God is that you may do no evil; not in order that I may appear approved, but that you may do what is noble, though I should seem unable to abide the proof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I have no power against the truth, but only in defense of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I am always glad whenever I am weak, but you are strong. For this also I am praying, for your perfect reformation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this reason I am writing thus while absent, so that when I come,  I may not have to deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Finally, brothers, farewell. Aim at perfection, take courage, be of one mind, live in peace; so shall the God of love and peace be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Salute one another with a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the saints salute you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
