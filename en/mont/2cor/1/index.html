On him I have set my hopes that he will continue to deliver me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>while all of you also are helping me by your prayers; so that from many lips thanksgiving may rise on my behalf for the blessings vouchsafed to me through the intercessions of many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For this is my proud boast, the testimony of my conscience, that it was in holiness and with pure motives before God, not in worldly wisdom, but in the grace of God, that I have conducted myself in the world, and above all in my relations with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I am writing to you nothing different from what you read aloud and very well recognize, and I hope will continue to recognize to the very end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as some indeed did recognize in part at last, that I am your cause of boasting, just as you will be mine on the Day of Jesus our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in this confidence I intended to visit you, before going elsewhere, that you might have a pleasure twice over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I intended to go by you into Macedonia, and to come again to you from Macedonia, and by you to be sent forward on my way to Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In purposing this did I display "caprice"? Or what I purpose do I purpose in a worldly way,so that it may mean either "Yes, yes," or "No, no"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As God is faithful, my message to you is not now "Yes," now "No."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For Jesus Christ, Son of God, who was proclaimed among you by us,  that is, by Silvanus and Timothy and me, was not wavering between "Yes" and "No," but in him is the everlasting "Yes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For however many are the promises of God, in him they are "Yes."  Therefore also through him let the Amen be said by our voices to the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he who has established me with you in the Anointed One, and has anointed me, is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He has also set his seal upon me, and given me the pledge of his Spirit in my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But for my part I call God to witness, as my soul shall answer for it, that it was to spare you that I came not to Corinth</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>(not that I am attempting to lord it over your faith, but rather to work with you for your happiness); for your faith is stedfast.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
