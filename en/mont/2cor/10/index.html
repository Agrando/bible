And I carry every thought away into captivity and subjection to Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and I am fully prepared to punish every act of disobedience, when once your submission has been put beyond question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Look these facts in the face. If any man is fully persuaded as regards himself that he belongs to Christ, let him consider again with himself, that just as he is Christs, so also am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If, however, I were to boast more loudly concerning the authority which the Lord gave me (not to cast you down, but to build you up), I should have no cause for shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let it not seem as if I were overawing you with my letters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"His letters indeed," says one, "are mighty and forcible, but his personality is weak, and his speech contemptible."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a man assure himself that my actions, when I am present,  will be just like my words in my letters when I am absent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have not indeed the audacity to class myself among, or compare myself with, certain of the self-commenders; yet they are not wise in measuring themselves by one another and in comparing themselves with one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I, however, will not indulge in undue boasting, but will confine it within the limits of the sphere to which God has assigned me - a sphere which reaches even to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For I am not overstepping the limits of my authority, as though I reached you not; since I have already come even as far as Corinth to proclaim the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I am not "boasting beyond measure in the labors of others," but it is my hope that, as your faith goes on increasing among yourselves,  by the enlargement of my appointed limits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I may carry the gospel to countries beyond you; and not be boasting of work made ready to my hand within another mans limit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Meanwhile. Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For a man is proved worthy, not by his self-commendation, but when he is commended by the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
