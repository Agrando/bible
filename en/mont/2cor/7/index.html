I have wronged no man, I have ruined no man, I have defrauded no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am not saying this to blame you, for as I have already said, I hold you in my heart to live together and to die together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Great is my faith in you; great is my cheerful assurance in you. I am filled with comfort; in spite of all my troubles, my heart is overflowing with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even after I reached Macedonia, my flesh had no rest, but I was troubled on every hand. Without were fights; within were, fears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the God who comforts the down-hearted comforted me by the coming of Titus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and not alone by his coming, but also by the comfort you had been to him. For he told me of your eager longing, of your penitence, and of your zeal on my behalf, so that I was happier still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Even if I caused you pain by my letter, I do not regret; though I did regret it when I saw that my letter had caused you pain, even for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But now I am glad; not because you were pained; but because your pain led you to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For your pain came from God, and so you took no harm from me. For the pain which is from God works repentance leading to salvation, a repentance never to be regretted. But the worlds pain works death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Note the results of this pain which God permitted; what earnestness it has called forth in you, what explanations, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what fervor, what punishment of wrong. In every way you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, even if I did write to you, it was not for the sake of the wrong-doer, or of him who had been wronged, but to make clear to yourselves in the sight of God your earnest care for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is what comforts me. In addition to this comfort of mine, I have been made still happier by the happiness of Titus; because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Although I have been boasting a little to him about you, I have not been put to shame. But as in every matter I have spoken the truth to you, so also my boast to Titus has been proved to be the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his tender affection is all the greater toward you, when he calls to mind the obedience of you all, and the fear and trembling with which you received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice that I have complete confidence in you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
