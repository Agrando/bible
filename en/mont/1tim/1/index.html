But I obtained mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the grace of our Lord overflowed with faith and love that is in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners"! And there is no greater sinner than I!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yet for this very cause I obtained mercy, so that in me, the chief of sinners, Jesus Christ might display all his boundless patience as an illustration for those who should later believe in him, and so gain life eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be glory and honor forever and ever. Amen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This charge then, I am laying upon you, Timothy, my son, according to the predictions formerly made concerning you. Fight the good fight in the spirit of these predictions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>keeping fast hold of faith and a good conscience; which certain individuals have cast aside, and so made shipwreck of their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have given over to Satan, so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
