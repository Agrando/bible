Continue to teach and preach this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If any one teaches heterodoxy, and refuses to consent to the wholesome words of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to the teachings of religion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is puffed up with conceit and knows nothing, but is doting about disputations and a strife of words. These give rise to envy,  quarrels, railings, evil suspicions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and wrangling between men whose minds are corrupt and destitute of the truth; who suppose that godliness is a source of gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now godliness with contentment is truly gainful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>for we have brought nothing into the world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So if we have food and shelter, let us be content with that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those who desire to be rich fall into the snares of temptation and many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is a source of all kinds of evil; and in their eager desire to be rich some have been led astray form the faith, and have pierced themselves with many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you, O servant of God, flee from these things, and run after integrity, piety, faith, love, stedfastness, gentleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Keep contending in the noble contest of the faith; seize hold on eternal life, to which you were called when you confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the presence of God who gives life to all, and of Christ Jesus who bore witness to the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I charge you, keep your commission spotless and irreproachable until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For in his own good time this will be brought about by that blessed and only potentate, King of kings and Lord of lords,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who alone possesses immortality, who dwells in light that none can approach, whom no man has ever seen or can see; to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Charge the rich of this world not to be supercilious, nor to trust in uncertain riches, but in God, who provides all things richly for our use.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Charge them to practise benevolence, to be rich in good works, to be open-handed and generous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>laying up right good treasure for themselves in the world to come,  in order that they may obtain the Life which is life indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O, Timothy, guard the treasure which is committed to you. Shun the profane babblings and contradictions of the falsely called "knowledge"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>which some professing have erred from the faith.
