Treat the young men as brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>the older women as mothers, the younger women as sisters in all purity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Ever honor widows who are really widows;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>but if any widow has children or grandchildren, let these learn to show their piety first toward their own household, and to make some return to their parents, for that is pleasing in Gods sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now she who is a widow indeed, and desolate, has fixed her hope on God, and devotes herself to supplications and prayers, day and night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But she who lives in wantonness is dead even while she still lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Keep admonishing them regarding these things, so that they may be irreproachable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if any one fails to provide for his own, and especially for his kindred, he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A widow, to be placed upon the list, must be not less than sixty years old, and one who has been the wife of but one husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She must be well reputed for good works, as one who has brought up a family, received strangers with hospitality, washed the feet of the saints, relieved the distressed, and diligently followed every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But exclude from the list the younger widows; for where they have become wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and incur condemnation because they have broken their first troth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moreover, they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house, and are not only idlers, but gossips also, and busybodies,  repeating things they ought not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It is my wish, then, that the younger widows marry, bear children,  rule their houses, and give no occasion to our adversary for railing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For already some widows have gone astray after Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Any believing woman, who has widowed relatives, ought to relieve them and not let the church be burdened with them; so that the church may relieve the really destitute widows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the elders who fill their offices well, be held worthy of twofold honor; especially those who have the task of preaching and teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the Scripture says, You must not muzzle an ox when he is treading out the grain, and The worker is worth his wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not receive an accusation against an elder, except on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rebuke offenders publicly, so that others also may take warning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I charge you solemnly in the presence of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ and of the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice against any man, and do nothing out of partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Never ordain any one hastily, nor take part in the wrong-doing of others. Keep yourself pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do not continue to drink nothing but water, but take a little wine for your stomachs sake, and your frequent attacks of illness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some mens sins are notorious, and lead them straight on the way to condemnation; but others sins follow them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So also noble deeds are conspicuous, and even if otherwise, they cannot be kept hidden.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
