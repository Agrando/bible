And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
