they found no city to dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
