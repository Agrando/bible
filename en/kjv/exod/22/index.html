he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, there shall no blood be shed for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed therewith;

if the thief be found, let him pay double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour's goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make it good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear;
