Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
