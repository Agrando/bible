in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
