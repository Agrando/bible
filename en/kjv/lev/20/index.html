he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall be childless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
