And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith: I am the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the priest with the holy thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted;
