and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
