and he stood in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed;

and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew their sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, foursquare;
