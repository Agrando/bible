And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.
