Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love him, because he first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
