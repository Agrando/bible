Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this thing unto my master, the LORD'S anointed, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words, saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away? wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men gat them up unto the hold.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
