As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These things I command you, that ye love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.
