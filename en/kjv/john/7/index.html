If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For neither did his brethren believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division among the people because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And every man went unto his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
