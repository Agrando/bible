And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
