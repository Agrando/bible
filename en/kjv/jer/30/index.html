wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me? saith the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
