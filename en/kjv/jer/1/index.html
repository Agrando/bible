And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou?
