and who knoweth us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
