As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
