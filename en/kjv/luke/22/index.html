is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
