And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
