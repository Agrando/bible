Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
