They do not wash their hands before they eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus asked them, Why do you break Gods law so that you can keep your own law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>God said, "Respect your father and your mother." And God said, "Anyone who says wrong things to his father or his mother will surely die."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say, "Tell your father or your mother that you have given to God what you were going to give to them." You say, "If anyone says that, then he does not need to help his father or mother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You make Gods law to mean nothing so you can keep your own laws!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You are not true to yourselves! What Isaiah said about you was true. He said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"These people respect me with their mouth but their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They do not mean it in their hearts when they worship me. Their teachings are only the words of men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus called the people to him. He said to them, Listen to me and understand what I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What goes into a persons mouth does not make him dirty. But what comes out of a persons mouth makes him dirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus. They said, The Pharisees were angry when they heard what you said. Did you know that?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered, Every plant that my Father in heaven did not plant will be pulled out by the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Leave them alone. They are blind men who are trying to lead blind men. If a blind man leads a blind man, they will both fall into a hole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Peter said to Jesus, Tell us the meaning of that story.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said, Do you still not understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not know this? What goes into the mouth goes into the stomach, and then it goes out of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But what comes out of the mouth, comes from the heart. This is what makes a person dirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Here is what comes from the heart: wrong thoughts, killing people, all kinds of adultery,  stealing, lying, and saying wrong things about people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These things make a person dirty. To eat with hands that are not washed does not make him dirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus left that place and went to the country of Tyre and Sidon. 22A woman of the people of Canaan was in that country. She called out, Sir, you are the Son of David.  Help me! My daughter is being troubled very much by a bad spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus did not answer her. His disciples came to him and said, Send her away. She keeps calling after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I was sent only to the people of Israel. They are like lost sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the woman came and bowed down in front of Jesus and worshipped him. She said,  Sir, help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said, It is not right to take the childrens food and give it to the little dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She answered, Yes, sir. But even the little dogs eat the food that falls from the tables of their masters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Jesus answered, Woman, you believe very much. The thing you want me to do will be done. And her daughter was healed at that very time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus went on from there along the Sea of Galilee. He went up on a hill and sat down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Many people came to him. They brought sick people with them. Some were lame. Some were hurt. Some were blind. Some could not talk. And there were many others. They laid them down in front of Jesus. And he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The people were surprised. They saw that people who had not been able to talk were talking. They saw that people who were hurt were made well. They saw that lame people were walking. They saw that blind people could see. And they praised the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus called his disciples to him. He said, I share the suffering of the people. They have been with me for three days and they have nothing to eat. I do not want to send them away hungry. If they go away hungry, they will get weak and fall on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The disciples said to him, Where can we get enough food in this lonely place to feed so many people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus said to them, How many loaves of bread have you? They said, We have seven,  and a few small fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He told the people to sit down on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he took the seven loaves of bread and the fish. He thanked God for them. Then he broke the bread and gave it to the disciples. The disciples gave it to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They all ate and had enough. They gathered seven baskets full of pieces that were left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The number of people who ate was about four thousand men, besides some women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus sent the people away. Then he got in the boat and went to the country around Magadan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>missing fehlt/missing</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
