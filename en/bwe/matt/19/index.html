He went away to the part of Judea that is on the other side of the Jordan River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Many people followed him. He healed them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The Pharisees came to Jesus to test him. They asked, Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him for any reason?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus answered, Have you not read this? From the time God first made people, he made them a man and a woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>God said, "A man must leave his father and mother and must stay with his wife. The two of them will be like one person."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they are not two people any more, but they are one person. Man must not separate what God has joined together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to Jesus, Then why did Moses make this law? He said that a man may give his wife a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus said to them, Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard. That is why he let you send your wives away. But in the beginning it was not that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I tell you this. No man may send his wife away unless she has committed adultery. If he does, and if he marries another woman, he commits adultery. And if a man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband, he commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciples said to him, If a man and woman are like that, then it is better not to marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus said, Not everyone can agree to that. But God has chosen some not to be married.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Some men cannot marry because they were born that way. Some were made that way by men. Others said, "I will not marry, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven." Anyone who can do this, should do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then people brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them and ask God to bless them. The disciples tried to stop the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them. The kingdom of heaven belongs to people like them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he put his hands on the children. Then he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A man came to Jesus and said, Teacher, what good thing must I do so that I will live for ever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said, Why do you ask me about what is good? Only God is good. If you want to live for ever, you must keep Gods laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The man said, Which laws? Jesus said, Do not kill. Do not commit adultery. Do not steal. Do not tell lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Respect your father and your mother. Love your neighbour as you love yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said, I have kept all those laws. What more must I do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said, If you want to be all right, go and sell everything you have. Give the money to poor people. For this you will be rich in heaven. Then come and go with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the young man heard that, he was sad, because he was very rich. So he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples, I tell you the truth. It is very hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I tell you this also. It is easier for a big animal like a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the disciples heard this, they were very much surprised. They said, Then who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus looked at them and said, Men cannot do it, but God can do anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter said, See, we have left all things and have come with you. So what will we have?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus said to them, I tell you the truth. In the new world, the Son of Man will be great.  He will sit on his throne of glory <FI>big chair of a king<Fi> to rule. Then you who have come with me will also sit on twelve thrones. You will judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If anyone has left his house, his brothers, his sisters, his father, his mother, his children,  or his farms for my sake, he will receive a hundred times as much as he has left. And he will live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many people who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
