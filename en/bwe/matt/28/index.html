Morning light was beginning to shine on the first day of the week. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The earth shook very much because an angel of the Lord came down from heaven. He came and rolled the big stone away from the grave and sat on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His face shone like lightning. His clothes were as white as snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The soldiers who were guarding the grave saw him and shook with fear. They fell down like dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The angel talked to the women. He said, Do not fear. I know you are looking for Jesus,  who was nailed to a cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here. He has risen, as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go quickly and tell his disciples, "He has risen from death. He is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there." Now, I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The women went quickly away. They left the grave with fear and they were very happy.  They ran to tell his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As they were going, Jesus met them. He said Greetings! The women bowed down in front of him and put their hands on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them, Do not fear. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While the women were going, some of the soldiers who had guarded the grave came into the city. They told the chief priests all that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The chief priests had a meeting with the leaders of the people and talked the matter over.  They gave much money to the soldiers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They said, Tell the people, "His disciples came by night and took away the body while we were sleeping."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If the ruler hears about this, then we will talk to him so that he will not punish you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The soldiers took the money. They did as they were told to do. And even to this day,  many of the Jewish leaders say this is what happened to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The eleven disciples went to Galilee. They went to the hill where Jesus had told them to meet him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they saw him, they bowed down in front of him. But some people were not sure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus came and talked to them. He said, All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So go and make disciples in all countries. Baptise them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Teach them to do all the things I have told you to do. I am with you always, even to the end of time.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
