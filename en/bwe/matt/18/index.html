They said, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jesus called a child to him. He had the child stand in front of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He said, I tell you the truth. If your hearts do not change and become like hearts of children, you will never go into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So anyone who feels himself small like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These little children believe in me. If anyone makes one of them do wrong, he will be punished. He will have worse trouble than if a big stone were tied to his neck and he were thrown into the deep sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There will be trouble in the world because people make other people do wrong! People will do wrong. But the person who makes another person do wrong will have trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If your hand or your foot makes you do wrong, cut it off and throw it away! It is better for you to enter into life without hands or feet than to have two hands and two feet and be thrown into the fire that burns for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If your eye makes you do wrong, pull it out and throw it away! It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, than to have two eyes and be thrown into the hell fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not think badly of these little children. I tell you this. They have angels in heaven.  And all the time their angels can see the face of my father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Son of Man came to save anyone who is lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>What do you think about this? A man has a hundred sheep. One of them is lost. Will he not leave the ninety-nine sheep on the hills and go to look for the one that is lost? Yes, he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I tell you the truth. When he finds it, he is more happy to see that one than the ninety-nine that were not lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the same way, my Father in heaven does not want one of these little children to be lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If your brother does something wrong to you, go to him. Talk alone to him and tell him what he has done. If he listens to you, you have kept your brother as a friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he does not listen to you, take one or two others with you to talk to him. Then two or three people will hear every word and can prove what was said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he does not listen to them, tell the church. If he does not listen to the church, treat him as one who does not believe in God and as bad as a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I tell you the truth. What you tie on earth will be tied in heaven. What you set free on earth will be set free in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I tell you another thing. If two of you on earth agree together to ask for something, my Father in heaven will do it for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where two or three people meet together in my name, I am there with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter came to Jesus and asked him, Lord, how many times should I forgive my brother when he does wrong things to me? Should I forgive him seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus answered him, I say not seven times only, but seventy times seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that way the kingdom of heaven is like this. A king was ready to finish his business with his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The first servant was brought in. He owed the king a very large sum of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He could not pay it. So his master said, "Go sell him, his wife, his children, and everything he has, and pay me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the servant bowed down in front of him. He begged, "Sir, give me time. I will pay everything."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>His master was sorry for him and let him go. He did not make him pay the money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>That same servant went out and met another servant. This man owed him a much smaller sum of money. He caught him by the throat and said, Pay me what you owe me!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then this servant bowed down in front of him. He begged, "Give me time. I will pay you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he said, "No." He went and put the man in prison until he could pay what he owed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The other servants saw what he did. They were very sad. They went and told their master everything that had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his master called the first servant to him. He said, "You bad man! I let you go. I did not make you pay all you owed me, because you begged me to be kind to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You should have been kind to the other servant, as I was kind to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>His master was very angry. He turned the servant over to the prison guards until he could pay all he owed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>That is like what my Father in heaven will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
