A king made a wedding for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The king sent his servants to call the people who had been asked to the wedding. But they would not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He sent other servants to call them. He said, "Tell those who were asked to the wedding that my dinner is cooked. The cows and bullocks have been killed. Everything is ready.  Come now to the wedding."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The people did not listen, but went away. One went to his farm. One went to his business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The others caught his servants, treated them very badly, and killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The king was very angry. He sent his soldiers to kill the men who had killed his servants.  And he burned their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to his servants, "The wedding is ready. But those who were asked to come were not good enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Go out on the roads. Call all the people you find to come to the wedding."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So those servants went out on the roads. They brought all the people they could find,  both bad and good people. Then the room was full of people for the wedding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The king came in to look at the people. He saw one man there who was not wearing the right clothes for a wedding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The king said to him, "My friend, why did you come here without putting on the right clothes for a wedding?" The man did not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king said to his servants, "Tie his hands and his feet. Put him in a dark place outside. People there will cry and grind <FI>make a noise with<Fi> their teeth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Many people are asked to come, but only a few are chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went away. They planned how to make Jesus say something wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They sent their disciples to him with some of Herods people. They said, Teacher, we know that you are true. We know that you teach the true way of God. You do not fear any person, or care how great he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So tell us. What do you think? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or is it not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus knew they were trying to get him into trouble. So he said to them, Why are you trying to get me to do wrong? You are not true to yourselves!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me a piece of money used for tax. They brought him a piece of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whose picture and name is this? he asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said, Caesars.Then he said to them, Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar. And give to God what belongs to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they heard that, they were surprised. They left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus. They say that people do not rise from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They came to ask him a question. They said, Teacher, Moses gave us this law: "If a man dies and has no children, then his brother must marry the wife and raise a family for his brother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There were seven brothers among us. The first one married. He died and left no children.  So his brother married the wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The same thing happened to the second brother, and the third one, and all seven of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Last of all, the woman died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now then, when people rise from death, which of the seven brothers will have her for his wife? They all married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered, You are wrong! You do not know what the holy writings say. And you do not know what power God has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When people rise from death, men and women do not marry. But they are like angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>People do rise from death! Have you never read what God said to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He said, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." He is not the God of dead people, but of living people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When the people heard this, they were surprised at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Pharisees heard that the Sadducees could not answer Jesus. So they got together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>One of them was a man who taught Gods law. He asked Jesus a question to try him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Teacher, he said, which law is the greatest law of all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart. Love him with all your soul,  and love him with all your mind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the first and greatest law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The second law of God is like it. "Love your neighbour as you love yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>All that is written in the books of the law and the books of the prophets is about these two laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>While the Pharisees were still there, Jesus asked them a question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He said, What do you think about Christ? Whose son is he? They said, He is Davids son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus asked, Then how can David call him "Lord"? He said, by the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>"The Lord said to my Lord, Sit beside me until I make you master over your enemies."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>David calls Christ his Lord. How can Christ be Davids son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>No one could answer him a word. And after that day, everyone feared to ask him any more questions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
