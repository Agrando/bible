The devil tried to make Jesus do wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jesus did not eat anything for forty days and forty nights. Then he was very hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The one who tries to make people do wrong came and said to him, If you are Gods Son,  tell these stones to be changed into bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "Man cannot live on bread only. He needs to live by every word that God says."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then the devil took Jesus to the holy city. He put him on a high part of the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The devil said to him, If you are Gods Son, jump down. The holy writings say, "God will tell his angels to take care of you. They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "You must not test the Lord your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The devil took Jesus to a very high hill.

The holy writings say, "You must worship the Lord your God. and he is the only one you are to worship."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the devil left Jesus. Angels came and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus heard that John was put in prison, so he went to Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He left the town of Nazareth and went to live in the town of Capernaum. It is by the sea (of Galilee) in the district of Zebulun and Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So what the prophet Isaiah said came true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He talked about, The country of Zebulun and the country of Naphtali, the road by the sea, the land on the other side of the Jordan River, Galilee where the people are not Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, The people who lived in darkness have seen a great Light. Light has come to those who lived in a land covered by the dark shadow of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From then on, Jesus began to tell Gods word to the people. He said, Stop your wrong ways and turn back to God! The kingdom of heaven is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus was walking by the sea of Galilee. There he saw two brothers, Simon who later was named Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus said to them, Come with me. The work I will give you will be to catch people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Right away they left their nets and went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus went on from there and saw two other brothers, James and John. Their fathers name was Zebedee. They were in the boat with their father mending their nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus called them. Right away they left the boat and their father and went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus went all around through Galilee. He taught people in their meeting houses and told them the good news about the kingdom of heaven. He healed all the sick and weak people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The people in all the country of Syria heard about him. They brought all who were sick in any way, or had bad spirits in them, and those who could not walk or use their hands.  Jesus healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Many people went with him. They came from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea,  and from the other side of the Jordan river.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
