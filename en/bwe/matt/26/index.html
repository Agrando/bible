The Son of Man will be given over to his enemies to be nailed to a cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then at that time the chief priests and the leaders of the people met together in the house of the high priest. His name was Caiaphas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They planned how to catch Jesus by some trick and have him killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they said, Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in the house of Simon, a man who had leprosy, a bad skin disease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She put the oil on Jesus head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the disciples saw this, they were angry. They said, Why was the oil wasted like that?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The oil might have been sold for much money. Then the money could have been given to poor people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good thing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You will always have poor people with you. But I will not always be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I tell you the truth. Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news, people will also tell what she has done. People will remember her because of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said, What will you give me if I help you catch Jesus? They gave him thirty pieces of silver money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from then on, Judas watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus. Supper</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The disciples came to Jesus and asked, Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, Go into the city to a certain man. Say to him, "The Teacher says, My time is near. I will come to your house with my disciples to eat the Passover Feast."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The disciples did what Jesus told them. They made the Passover food ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When evening came, Jesus sat down to eat with the twelve disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As they were eating, Jesus said, I tell you the truth. One of you will give me over to people who hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They were very sad and troubled. One after the other they began to say to him, Lord, is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered them, The man who is putting his hand in the dish with me is the one who will give me over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of Man will go away just as the holy writings tell about him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Judas was the one who would give Jesus over to the people who hated him. He said,  Master, is it I? Jesus said, Yes, it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As they were eating, Jesus took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. He gave it to the disciples and said, Take this bread and eat it. It is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He also took a cup. He thanked God for it. Then he gave it to the disciples and said, All of you drink from this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This is my blood. My blood is the blood of the new agreement. It is given so that many people will be forgiven for the wrong things they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I tell you this. I will not drink any of the juice of the fruit of the vine again, until I drink some of it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They sang a song and then went out to the hill called the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them, All of you will leave me this night. The holy writings say, "I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep. And the sheep will run away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am raised from death, I will go to Galilee to meet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Peter said, Even if all the others leave you, I will never leave you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This night, before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said, Even if I must die with you, I will never say I do not know you! All the disciples said the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples, Sit down here. I will go over there and talk with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He took Peter and Zebedees two sons with him. Jesus began to be sad and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said to them, My heart is very sad. I am almost dying! Stay here and watch with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus went on a little further. He bowed down with his face to the ground. He talked to God and said, My Father, if it can be, let this cup of trouble pass by me. But do not do what I want. May what you want be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus went back to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, What? Could you not watch with me for one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Watch and talk with God, so that you will not do wrong. A persons heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus went away again. He talked to God and said, My Father, if you do not want this cup to pass by me, but you want me to drink it, I will do what you want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He left them and went away again. He talked with God the third time and said the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he went back to his disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting?  The time has come now. The Son of Man is given over to bad people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Get up. Let us go. Look, here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>As Jesus was saying this, Judas came. He was one of the twelve disciples. Many people came with him. They had long knives or swords and big sticks. The chief priests and the leaders of the people had sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign. He said, The man that I kiss is the one. Catch him and hold him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Right then he went to Jesus and said, Greetings, Master! And he kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, Friend, why have you come? Then the men came and caught Jesus and held him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>One of the men who was with Jesus took his sword in his hand. He hit the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back in its place. All people who fight with a sword will be killed by a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Do you think that I cannot talk to my Father, and he would send me right now more than twelve armies of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But then, how would Gods word come true? The holy writings say that this is the way it must be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>At that same time Jesus said to the people, Have you come to take me with swords and sticks as you would a man who steals? Every day I sat with you in the temple and taught.  But you did not try to catch me then.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>All this happened so that what the prophets said in the holy writings would come true.  Then all the disciples left Jesus and ran away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The men who caught Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest. The scribes and the leaders had met at his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Peter followed Jesus a long way behind. He went as far as the yard of the high priests house. He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest. He wanted to see how this would end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The chief priests and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But they found nothing. Many people came and said things that were not true. At last two men came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>They said, This man said, "I can break down Gods temple and build it again in three days."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>The high priest stood up. He said to Jesus, Have you no answer? What do you have to say about this? They have said something against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus said nothing at all. Then the high priest said to him, I ask you in the name of the living God. Tell us. Are you the Christ, the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus answered him, Yes, I am. Also I tell you that after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds in the sky!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, What he has said is wrong! We do not need any more proof against him. You have heard the wrong thing he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What do you think? They said, He should be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spat on Jesus face and hit him. Others slapped him with their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>They said, Christ, tell us, if you know who hit you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl came to him and said, You were also with Jesus of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But Peter said in front of them all, I do not know what you are talking about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Peter went out to the gate. There, another servant-girl saw him. She said to the others around there, This man was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Peter said some bad words and then said, I do not know the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>A little later, those standing around came to Peter and said, Surely you are one of them also. We know it by the way you talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then Peter began to say even more bad words. He said, I do not know the man! Right then, a cock called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>Then Peter remembered that Jesus had said, Before the cock calls, you will say three times that you do not know me. Then Peter went out and cried very much.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
