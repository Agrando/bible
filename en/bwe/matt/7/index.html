How much you give to others is how much will be given to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Why do you look at the spot of dust in your brothers eye? But you do not see a big stick in your own eye!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why do you say to your brother, "Let me take the dust out of your eye"? And all the time you have that stick in your own eye!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You are not true to yourselves! First take the stick out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see to take the dust out of your brothers eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not give what is holy to dogs. Do not throw your fine stones to pigs. They will walk all over them, and then turn and hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ask, and you will get what you ask for. Look, and you will find what you look for.  Knock, and the door will be opened for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Everyone who asks will get. The one who looks will find. And the one who knocks will have the door opened for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If your son asks for bread, will any of you give him a stone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or if he asks for a fish, will you give him a snake?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You are wrong, and yet you know how to give good things to your children. Much more,  your Father in heaven will give good things to those who ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Do to other people what you want them to do to you. That is what the law and the writings of the prophets say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go in by the small gate. The gate is big and the road is wide that goes to death. Many people go that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The gate is small and the road is not wide that goes to life. Not many people find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Take care. There are prophets who are not true. They come to you dressed like sheep,  but inside they are like wolves, bad animals that kill sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will know them by the things they do. People do not pick fruit like grapes from thistles. They do not pick fruit like figs from thorn trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the same way, every good tree has good fruit. But a bad tree has bad fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree cannot have bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot have good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Every tree that does not have good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So you will know them by the things they do, good or bad fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Some people say to me, "Lord, Lord". But not all who say that will go into the kingdom of heaven. Only those who do what my Father in heaven wants, will go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Many people will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not speak in your name?  Did we not drive bad spirits out of people in your name? Did we not do big works in your name?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I will say to them, "I never knew you. Go away from me! What you do is very wrong!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Everyone who hears what I say and obeys me will be like a man who has good sense.  He built his house on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It rained hard. The water in the rivers came up high. The winds were strong and beat on the house. But it did not fall down. It was built on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But everyone who hears what I say and does not obey me, will be like a man who has no sense. He built his house on the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It rained hard. The water in the rivers came up high. The winds were strong and beat on the house. It fell down with a loud noise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus finished saying all these things. The people were surprised at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He taught them as if he had the right to teach them. He did not teach like their scribes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
