They wanted to test him, so they asked him to show them a sign from the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He answered them, In the evening you say, "It will be a nice day tomorrow because the sky is red."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>In the morning you say, "It will be a stormy day, because the sky is red and there are clouds." You know the meaning of these signs in the sky. But you do not know the meaning of the signs about the time in which we are living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>People today are wrong. They have gone away from God. They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah. Then Jesus went away and left them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When the disciples reached the other side of the sea, they found they had forgotten to bring any bread with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said, Watch! Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees spoil you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The disciples said to each other, He said that because we did not bring any bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus knew what they were saying. He said to them, You dont believe very much in me.  Why are you saying to each other, "We have no bread".</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do you not yet understand? When there were five thousand people, there were only five loaves of bread. Do you not remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When there were four thousand people, there were only seven loaves. Do you not remember how many baskets full of pieces you gathered up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why do you not understand that I was not talking about bread? Take care. Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees spoil you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that he was not talking about bread. He did not mean that the yeast of bread would spoil them. They understood that he was talking about the things the Pharisees and Sadducees taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus went to the country of Caesarea Philippi. He asked his disciples, I am the Son of Man. Whom do people say I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They answered, Some people say you are John the Baptizer. Others say you are Elijah.  And others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to them, Whom do you say I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon Peter answered, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus answered, Simon, Jonahs son, God has blessed you. No person on earth has showed you this. But my Father in heaven has showed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I tell you this. You are Peter. On this rock I will build my church. The power of death will not destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. What you tie on earth will be tied in heaven. What you set free on earth will be set free in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Jesus said to the disciples, Do not tell anyone that I am the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time on, Jesus began to teach his disciples. He said, I must go to Jerusalem. I will have much trouble from the leaders, the chief priests, and the scribes. I will be killed.  On the third day, I will be raised from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Peter took him to one side and began to talk to him. He said, Lord! May God stop it!  This must never happen to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Jesus turned to Peter and said, Get away from me Satan! You are trying to make me do wrong. You are not thinking the way God thinks, but the way people think.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus told his disciples, If anyone wants to come with me, he must leave what he himself wants to do. He must be willing to carry his cross and come with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Anyone who wants to keep his life will lose it. And anyone who gives up his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself, but loses his life? What can a person give to get back his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The Son of Man will come with his angels and will be great like his Father. Then he will pay every man for what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I tell you the truth. Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the Son of Man come in his kingdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
