He went to teach and tell Gods word to people in the towns around there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>John was in prison. He heard what Christ was doing. So he sent two of his disciples to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He asked, Are you the one who will come? Or shall we wait for another person?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus answered them, Go and tell John what you hear and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Blind people see. Lame people walk. People with leprosy are healed. People who could not hear, can hear. Dead people are made alive. Poor people hear the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Anyone who is not troubled in his heart about me, will be happy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When Johns disciples went away, Jesus began to talk to people about John. He said,  What did you go out into the wilderness to see? Did you go out to see a tall grass moved by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>What did you go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? People who wear fine clothes live in kings houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Why did you go out? To see a prophet of God? Yes, I tell you, and he is much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He is the man the holy writings tell about. "See, I send my messenger ahead of you. He will make the way ready for you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I tell you the truth. No one has ever been born who is greater than John the Baptizer.  And yet the smallest one in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From the time of John until now, people try hard to break into the kingdom of heaven.  And strong people take hold of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>All the prophets and the books of the law gave Gods word until John came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you will believe it, this man is the Elijah who would come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everyone who has ears, listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What shall I say that the people of today are like? They are like children who sit in the market. They call to the other children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say, "We played music for you, but you did not dance. We cried, but you did not cry."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>John came. He does not eat or drink much. People say, "He has a bad spirit in him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of Man came. He eats and drinks. People say, "This man eats and drinks too much! He is a friend with tax collectors and bad people!" But a man is proved to be wise by what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Jesus began to talk about the towns where he had done most of his big works. He said hard things about the people, because they did not stop their wrong ways and turn back to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said, Chorazin! You will have trouble! Bethsaida! You will have trouble! If the big works I did in you had been done in the cities of Tyre and Sidon, the people there would have stopped their wrong ways long ago. They would wear the clothes people wear to show they are sad. They would sit in ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I tell you, on the day when people are judged, you will be punished harder than the people from the cities of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Capernaum, will you be lifted up to the sky? No, you will go down to death. If the big things I did in you had been done in the city of Sodom, it would be standing now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I tell you, on the day when people are judged you will be punished harder than the people from Sodom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jesus said, Father, you are Lord of heaven and earth. I thank you because you have hidden these things from people who are wise and know many things. But you have shown them to people who are like children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, Father, that was the way you wanted it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He said, My Father has given everything to me. No one knows who the Son is but the Father. No one knows who the Father is but the Son and those to whom the Son wants to show him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All you who work hard! All you who carry heavy loads! Come to me! I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Do what I tell you. Learn what I teach you. I am gentle. I am not proud. Then your hearts will rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What I tell you to do is easy. What I give you to carry is not heavy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
