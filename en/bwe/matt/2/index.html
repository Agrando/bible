Herod was the king.  After Jesus was born, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They asked, Where is the child who has been born to be King of the Jews? We saw his star rising and we have come to worship him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When King Herod heard this, he was very troubled. All the people in Jerusalem were troubled also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He called all the chief priests and the scribes of the Jews for a meeting. He asked them,  Where is the Christ to be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They told him, In Bethlehem in Judea. That is what the prophet, the man of God long ago, wrote:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Bethlehem in the country of Judah, you are not the least among the leaders in Judah. A leader will come from you who will rule over my people Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod called the wise men to talk with them secretly. He found out from them what time they saw the star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He sent them to Bethlehem. He said, Go and ask everywhere until you find the child.  When you have found him, come and tell me, so that I myself may go and worship him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After they heard what the king said, they went away. And the star, which they had seen rising, went in front of them. It stopped above the place where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they saw the star, they were very glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They went into the house, and there they saw the child and Mary his mother. They kneeled down and worshipped him. Then they opened their bags and gave him gifts.  These gifts were gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In a dream they were told not to go back to Herod. So they went home by a different road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>After the wise men had gone, Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him and said, Get up. Take the child and his mother, and go quickly to the country of Egypt. Stay there till I tell you, because Herod will try to find the child and kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother in the night and went to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He stayed there until Herod died. What the Lord told through his prophet long ago, came true. He said I called my son out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Herod saw that the wise men had fooled him. He was very angry. He sent men to kill all the baby boys in the town of Bethlehem and around it. They killed all the boys who were two years old or less. Herod remembered what the wise men had told him about the time they first saw the star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So what the prophet Jeremiah said, came true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said, A voice could be heard in the town of Ramah. Rachel was crying for her children. She would not let anyone comfort her because her children were dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Herod died. Then Joseph had a dream. An angel of the Lord came to him in Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The angel said, Get up. Take the child and his mother and go to the country of Israel.  The men who wanted to kill the child are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Joseph woke up. He took the child and his mother and went to the country of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he heard that Archelaus was king of Judea in his father Herods place. So he was afraid to go there. In a dream he was told what to do. He went to the country of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He went and made his home in the town of Nazareth. The prophets of God long ago had said, He shall be called a man from Nazareth. What they said came true.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
