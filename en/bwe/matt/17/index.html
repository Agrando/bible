He led them up a hill by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jesus was changed in front of them. His face was bright like the sun. His clothes were white, like light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then they saw Moses and Elijah talking with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Peter said to Jesus, Lord, this is a good place for us. If you want, we will make three places here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While he was saying this, a bright cloud came over them. A voice in the cloud said, This is my dear Son. I am very pleased with him. Listen to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the disciples heard it, they bowed their faces to the ground. They were very much afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus came and touched them. He said, Get up. Do not fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they looked up, they saw no one but Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When they came down the hill, Jesus said to them, Do not tell anyone what you saw. Do not tell it until after the Son of Man has been raised from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The disciples asked him, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus answered, Elijah does come. He will get everything ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I tell you that Elijah has come already. The people did not know him. And they did to him just what they wanted to do. So also the Son of Man will be troubled by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples knew that he was talking about John the Baptizer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They came to the people. A man came and kneeled in front of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said, Sir, help my son. A bad spirit is in him and he has much trouble. Often he falls into the fire, and often he falls into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I brought him to your disciples, but they could not heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said, You people today do not believe. You have turned away from God. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus talked to the bad spirit and he came out of the boy. The boy was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples came to Jesus alone. They asked him, Why could we not drive the bad spirit out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus said to them, Because you do not believe enough. I tell you the truth. If your strength to believe were as much as a little mustard seed, you could say to this hill, "Go,  move over to that place!" And it would move. Nothing is too hard for you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But this kind of bad spirit does not come out of a person unless people ask God and fast <FI>do not eat food for a time<Fi> .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They were travelling in Galilee. Jesus said to his disciples, The Son of Man will be given over to men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They will kill him. But he will be raised on the third day. This troubled the disciples very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They came to Capernaum. There the men who were collecting the tax for the temple came to Peter. They asked him, Does not your teacher pay the tax for the temple?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Peter said, Yes, he does. When he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him about it first. He said, Simon, what do you think? From whom do kings on earth take taxes? Do they take them from their own people or from other people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Peter said, From other people. Jesus said, Then the sons do not pay a tax.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But we must not make them think something wrong about us. So go to the sea. Throw a fish-hook into the water. Take the first fish you catch. Open its mouth and you will see a piece of money. Take it and pay them the tax for you and me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
