A person must get to the sheep through the door. Anyone who climbs over the wall to get in is a bad man and steals things. He has come to steal the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But the man who comes in through the door, he is the one who takes care of the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The guard will open the door for him. The sheep will listen to him. He calls his own sheep by their names and leads them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When all his own sheep are out of the house, he goes ahead of them. The sheep come behind him because they know his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They will not go after a stranger. They will run away from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus told this story to the Pharisees, but they did not understand what he was trying to tell them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Jesus told them again. He said, I tell you the truth. I am the door of the sheep house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All those who came before me are bad people and steal things. They came to steal the sheep. But the sheep did not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the door. Anyone who comes in through me will be saved. He will go in and out as he wants to, and will have food to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief comes only to steal the sheep and to kill them and spoil them. I have come so that people may live and that they may enjoy life to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the good shepherd. I am the one who really cares for the sheep. The good shepherd is willing to die to save his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Some people work for pay. The one who does that is not the one who really cares. The sheep do not belong to him. When he sees a bad animal coming, he will leave the sheep and run away. He will let the animal take the sheep and make the sheep run away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He does that because he is only working for pay and does not care what happens to the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd, the one who really cares for the sheep. I know my sheep and my sheep know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So my Father knows me and I know him. I am willing to die to save the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I have some other sheep which are not with these sheep. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice. Then all the sheep will be together and there will be one person who cares for all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My Father loves me because I am willing to die. But when I die, I will live again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one kills me. I die only because I choose to die. I have power to die and I have power to live again. This is what my Father has told me to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Jews did not all say the same thing because of what Jesus said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them said, A bad spirit is in him. He is crazy. Why do you listen to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But others said, A person who has a bad spirit in him does not say the things this man says. Can a bad spirit make blind people see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>At that time there was a feast in Jerusalem at the temple. It was the cold time of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus was walking in that part of the temple called Solomons resting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Jews came around Jesus and said, How long will you keep us wondering about this matter? If you are really the Christ, then tell us plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jesus said, I have already told you and you did not believe it. My Father has given me the power to do big works. These works tell you who I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And yet you do not believe because you are not my sheep. I told you this before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep listen to me. I know them. They come to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I give them life that lasts for ever. They will never die. No one will take them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father gave the sheep to me. He is greater than anyone else. No one is able to take them out of my Fathers hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>My Father and I are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the leaders of the Jews picked up stones again to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So Jesus said to them, I have done many good things that come from my Father. For which one of those are you going to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the Jewish leaders answered him, We do not kill you for doing any good thing. But you do not respect God. You are only a man, and yet you say you are God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, In your own books it is written that God said, "You are gods."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>, fehlt/missing</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Nothing can change the words in the holy writings. It is written that God spoke to men and that he called them gods. So he called some men gods. Then why do you say I do not respect God when I say that I am the Son of God? I am the one God chose and sent into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I am not doing my Fathers work, then do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I am doing my Fathers work, believe the work that I do, even though you do not believe me. Then you will know and you will believe that my Father is in me and I am in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Because of what he said, they tried to catch Jesus again. But he got away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He went away again to the other side of the Jordan River. He went to the place where John <FI>the Baptizer<Fi> was when he first baptized people. Jesus stayed there for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Many people came to him there. They said, John himself did not do any big work. But everything that John said about this man is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Many people believed on Jesus there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
