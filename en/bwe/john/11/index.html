He lived at Bethany, the home of Mary and her sister Martha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Mary was the same woman that put oil on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So the sisters sent someone to tell Jesus. They said, Lord, the one whom you love is sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus heard the message. He said, The man is sick, but he will not die from it. But this will show people that God is great, and his Son also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two days more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After that, he said to his disciples, Let us go back again to Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They said, Master, it is not long since the Jews wanted to kill you with stones. Are you going back there again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus answered them, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a person walks in the daylight, then he will not fall. He can see by the light that is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if a person walks at night, he will fall because there is no light for him to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After he said this, he said also, Our friend Lazarus is sleeping, but I am going to wake him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His disciples said, Lord, if he is sleeping then he will get well again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jesus meant that Lazarus had died. The disciples thought that Lazarus was sleeping to have a rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jesus told them plainly. He said, Lazarus is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For your sake I am glad that I was not there. You will really believe in me. But come, let us go to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to the other disciples, Let us all go and die with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been buried four days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Bethany was only about two miles from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Many Jews had come out to see Martha and Mary. They came to comfort them because their brother had died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary just stayed in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But even yet, I know that God will give you anything that you ask for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said, Your brother will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha said, I know that he will rise when the dead people are raised up on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said, I am the one who will raise people up and give them life. The person who believes in me will live, even though he has died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Anyone who is living and who believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said, Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ. I believe that you are the Son of God who was to come into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When she had said this, she went back to call her sister. She said quietly, Mary, the Master has come. He is calling you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When Mary heard that, she got up quickly and came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus was not in the town yet. He was at the same place where Martha had met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews who were in the house to comfort Mary saw her get up quickly and go out.  They went after her. They said, She is going to the grave to cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Mary reached the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she kneeled down before him and said, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus saw her crying. He saw the Jews who came with her crying also. Then his heart was troubled very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Where have you buried him? he said. Come, Lord, and see, they said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus cried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Look, the Jews said. He truly loved him very much!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then some of them said, This man made the blind see. Could he not have saved Lazarus from dying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus heart was troubled very much again. Then he came to the grave. It was a hole in the side of a large rock. A stone covered the hole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, Take the stone away. Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, Lord, he will smell bad by this time. He has been dead four days already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believed God you would see that he is great?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they pushed the stone away from the grave. Jesus looked up and said, Father, I thank you because you have heard me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I know that you always hear me. But I have said this so that the people who are standing here might believe that you have sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When he had said this, he shouted, Lazarus, come out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Out came the dead man! The cloth that they had buried him in was tied around his hands and feet. Another small cloth was tied around his face. Jesus said to the people, Take off the cloths and free him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When they saw the things Jesus did, many of the Jews who had come with Mary believed on Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So the chief priests and the Pharisees met together. They said, What are we going to do?  This man is doing many big works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we do not stop him, everybody will believe on him. Then the Roman rulers will come and break down our holy town and our nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>One of them, Caiaphas, was high priest that year. He said to them, You know nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>You do not understand. It is better for us if one person dies for the people. Then the whole nation will not be broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He himself did not understand what he was saying. But he was the high priest that year.  God spoke through him to say that Jesus should die for those people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus would die, not only for those people, but he would gather together all of Gods people who are out in different places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So from that day on they planned to kill Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>That is why Jesus did not go among the Jews in the open. But he went to another part of the country, to a town called Ephraim. He stayed there with his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The time for the Passover Feast of the Jews was near. Many people from all around the country went to Jerusalem. They had to make themselves clean according to the law before the Passover Feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>They were looking around for Jesus. As they were standing in the temple they talked to one another. They said, What do you think? Do you think that he will come to the feast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Both the chief priest and the Pharisees had told the people, If any man knows where he is, tell us. We want to catch him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
