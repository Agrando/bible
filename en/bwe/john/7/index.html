He would not travel around in Judea because the leaders of the Jews wanted to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Every year the Jews had a feast to remember the time when their fathers lived in tents in the desert. The time was near for that feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus brothers said to him, Go away from here to Judea. Let your disciples also see the work you are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When a person wants people to know about him, he does not hide what he is doing. If you are doing these big things, let the world see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even his brothers did not believe in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to them, It is not yet the time for me to go. But you may go any time you want to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The people of the world cannot hate you. But they hate me because I say what they do is wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Go to the feast yourselves. I am not going to the feast until it is the right time for me to go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said this to them and stayed in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>After his brothers went to the feast, Jesus went also. He did not go with the other people,  but he went by himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The leaders of the Jews at the feast tried to find him. They said, Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>People were talking among themselves about Jesus. Some said, He is a good man.  Others said, No. He is leading people to do wrong things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, so no one talked about him out in the open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the feast was half finished, Jesus went to the temple and taught the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews were very much surprised. How can this man know books? He never went to school.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus answered the people, I am not teaching you my teaching. It is the teaching of the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man wants to do what God wants him to do, he will know the teaching. He will know if it is Gods teaching or if I am speaking from my own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The person who speaks from his own mind only wants to be great himself. But the person whom God has sent wants to show that God is great. That person is true. He is not a bad man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did not Moses give you the law? Not one of you is keeping the law. Why are you trying to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered Jesus, A bad spirit is in you! Who is trying to kill you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered them, I have done one thing. You are all surprised about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses gave you the law of circumcision. You obey the law, not because it came from Moses, but because it came from the fathers long ago. You circumcise a baby boy on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You do it on the Sabbath day so that you will not break the law of Moses. If you do that,  then why are you angry with me because I healed a man on the Sabbath day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do not judge by what you see, but judge in the right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Some people from Jerusalem said, Is not this the person they are trying to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>See, he does not fear to speak and yet they say nothing to him! Do the rulers really know that this man is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But we know where this man comes from. When the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus was teaching in the temple. He spoke loudly saying, You know me and you know where I come from. I have not come in my own power. The one who sent me is true. He is the one you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know him because I came from him. He sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the people wanted to catch him. But no one put a hand on him. It was not yet the time for that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Many of the people believed in Jesus. They said, When Christ comes, will he do greater works than this man has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard what the people said about him. The chief priests and the Pharisees sent soldiers to catch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus said, I will stay with you a short time longer. Then I will go back to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You will look for me, but you will not find me. You will not be able to go to the place where I will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews said to one another, Where will he go that we cannot find him? Will he go to our people who are living in other countries? Will he teach them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What does he mean by this: "You will look for me and will not find me. You will not be able to go to the place where I will be"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The last day of the feast was a big day. On that day Jesus stood up and shouted, If anyone is thirsty, he may come to me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If anyone believes in me, the holy writings say, "Rivers of water that give life will flow out of his heart."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>This is what Jesus meant: those who believe in him would receive the Spirit. At that time no one had received the Holy Spirit because Jesus had not yet been lifted up to heaven</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When some of the people heard this they said, Truly, this is the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Other people said, This is the Christ. But some said, The Christ will not come from Galilee. Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Do not the holy writings say that Christ will be of Davids family? Will he not come from Bethlehem where David lived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The people did not all say the same thing about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Some of them wanted to catch Jesus, but no one put hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The soldiers came back to the chief priests and the Pharisees. They asked the soldiers,  Why did you not bring him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The soldiers replied, No person has ever talked like he does!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees said, Has he fooled you also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>None of the rulers and none of the Pharisees have believed on him, have they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>These poor people do not know the law. They will die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus, the man who came to Jesus by night, was one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He said, Is it right to judge any man by our law before we hear him and learn what he has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered him, Are you from Galilee also? Study what is written. You will see that no prophet is to come from Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then every one of them went home.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
