The Word and God were together. The Word was God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Before anything began to be, the Word was there with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>God made everything by the Word. Nothing has been made without him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Life was in the Word. That life was Light for people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Light shone where it was dark and the darkness did not stop the Light from shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>God sent a man named John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He came to talk about the Light, so that all people might believe in the Light by what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He himself was not that Light, but he was sent to talk about the Light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The true Light which gives light to every person who comes into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He, the Word, was in the world. Yes, he even made the world. And yet the world did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He came into the world that was his own, but his own people did not receive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But there were people who did believe in his name. They did receive him. He gave all those who received him and believed him the right to become children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They were born into Gods family by God. That is, they were not born into his family in the way a person is born into this world. It was not by any persons will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Word became man and he lived among us. We saw with our own eyes that he is great. He is great the way God the Father made his only Son great. We saw that he is full of loving kindness and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>John talked about him. He called out saying, Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He was full of loving kindness, and we have all received so much kindness from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moses gave the law, but Jesus Christ gave this loving kindness and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one has ever seen God. But his only Son is very near to his Fathers heart. He has told us plainly about God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The leaders of the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem. They asked John, Who are you? John told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He did not hide the truth, but he told people plainly. He said, I am not the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they asked him, Well then, are you Elijah? He answered, No, I am not. They asked,  Are you the Prophet? He answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then those priests said, Who are you? We want to give an answer to the people who sent us. What do you say about yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>John said, I am a voice calling in the desert, "Make the road straight for the Lord." This is what was said by Isaiah, the prophet of God long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It was the Pharisees who had sent these people to John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So they asked him, If you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet, why then are you baptizing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered, I baptize people in water. But there is a man standing among you whom you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is the one coming after me who is greater than I am. I am not even good enough to untie his shoe strings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The place where John was baptizing was Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The next day John saw Jesus coming to him. Look, said John. See Gods special Lamb!  He takes away the wrong ways of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Here is the man I told you about. I said that the one who is coming after me is greater than I am, because he lived before I lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I myself did not know who he was. But I came and baptized people in water so that the people of Israel would know who he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>John also said, I saw the Spirit coming from the sky. He came down on him like a dove.  It stayed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I myself did not know who he was. But he who sent me to baptize people in water told me. He said, "You will see the Spirit coming from the sky on a man. That man will baptize people in the Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I saw the Spirit coming on him, and I have told you. This man is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The next day, John was standing with two of his followers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus walked by. When John saw him, he said, Look, see Gods Lamb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The two followers heard what John said, so they went after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus turned. He saw them coming after him. He said to them, What are you looking for? They said, Teacher, where do you live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, Come and see. They went and saw the place where Jesus was staying. The time was about four oclock in the afternoon. They stayed with Jesus the rest of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Andrew was one of those two followers of John who heard John speak and went after Jesus. He was Simon Peters brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The first thing Andrew did then was to find his brother Simon. He said, We have found the Messiah! (Messiah means the Christ, the messenger of God.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, You are Simon, the son of John. Your name will be Cephas. (Cephas means Peter, a rock or stone.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The next day Jesus said, I will go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, Come with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Philip was from the town of Bethsaida. Andrew and Peter were also from that town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip went to find Nathanael. He said We have found the man about whom Moses wrote in the books of the law. The prophets also wrote about him. He is Jesus, from Nazareth. He is the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Nathanael said, From Nazareth? Can any good thing come from there? Philip said,  Come and see for yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him. He said, Here is a man who is truly of Israel. He does not fool people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael asked, How do you know me? Jesus answered, I saw you when you were under the fig tree. That was before Philip called you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael said, Teacher, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered, I told you that I saw you under the fig tree. Is that why you believe in me now? You will see more wonderful things than that!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I tell you the truth, said Jesus. You will see heaven open. You will see Gods angels going up and down to the Son of Man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
