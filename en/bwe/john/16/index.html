Yes, the time is coming when someone will kill you and think he is working for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They will do these things because they do not know my Father nor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have told you all these things now. Then when that time comes, you will remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you these things in the beginning because I myself was with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I am going back to him who sent me here. Yet not one of you is asking me,  "Where are you going?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Your hearts are very sad because I have told you these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Anyway, I am telling you the truth. It is better for you if I go away. If I do not go away,  the one who is to help you will not come to you. But if I go away, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the Helper comes, he will prove this to the people of the world that they are wrong. They are wrong about what they call bad and about what they call good. He will show them how to be right with God. He will show them about Gods judgement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He will prove it is a bad thing that they do not believe in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He will show what really is right, because I am going to my Father and you will not see me any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He will show them how to judge right, because the ruler of this world himself will be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have many other things to tell you, but you cannot understand them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the truth-giving Spirit comes, he will show you everything that is true. He will not speak his own message, but he will tell you the things that he has been told to tell you. He will tell you what is going to happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will make my name great. He will take what is mine and tell it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everything that belongs to my Father belongs to me also. That is why I said, "He will take what is mine and tell it to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Very soon now, you will not see me. A little while after that, you will see me again,  because I go to my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Some of the disciples talked among themselves and said, He says, "Very soon now, you will not see me. A little while after that, you will see me." And he says, "Because I go to my Father." What does he mean by "a little while"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We do not know what he means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him this question. So he said to them, Are you asking each other what I mean by saying, "Very soon you will not see me. Then in a little while after that you will see me"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I tell you the truth. You people will cry and be very sad, but the people in the world will be very glad. At first you will be sad, but after that you will not be sad. You will be glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Any woman is sad just before her baby is born. She has much pain because the time has come for the baby to be born. But as soon as the baby is born, she forgets the pain she had. She is very glad because a person has been born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So you also are very sad now. But I will see you again. Then you will be very glad. And no one can take your joy from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When that time comes, you will not ask me for anything. I tell you the truth. My Father will do for you anything you ask in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You have not asked for anything in my name yet. Ask my Father and he will give it to you. That is what will make you very glad always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have told you these things by a story. The time will come when I will not talk by stories. I will tell you about my Father plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When that day comes, you will ask in my name. I do not say that I will ask my Father for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My Father himself loves you. He loves you because you have loved me. And he loves you because you have believed that God sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>My Father sent me into the world. And now I will leave the world and go back to my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The disciples said to him, Yes, now you are telling us plainly. You are not telling us with words we do not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We know now that you know everything. No one needs to ask you questions. This makes us believe that God sent you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, Do you really believe now?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Listen, the time is coming. No, the time is here when you will run away. Every man will go to his own home. You will leave me on my own. And yet I am not alone, because my Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have told you these things so that you may have peace. I give you peace. The world will trouble you much. But be glad. I have power over the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
