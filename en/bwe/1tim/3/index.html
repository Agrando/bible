If a man wants to be a leader of the church people, he seeks a good thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For a man to be a church leader, people must speak well of him. He must have only one wife. He must be able to control himself. He must use good sense. He must behave himself well. He must be kind to strangers in his house. He must be a good teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He must not get drunk. He must not fight. But he must be kind. He must not quarrel. He must not love money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He must be a good leader for his own family. His children must obey him and respect him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If a man does not know how to lead his own family, how can he take care of the church of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A church leader must not be a new believer. If he were a new believer, he might become proud and set himself up like the devil did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>People who are not church people must also speak well of a church leader, so that he will not fall into the devils trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In the same way, the leaders helpers must be men whom people respect. They must not say one thing one time and something different another time. They must not drink too much wine. They must not try to get rich in wrong ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They must know Gods plan and what we believe. They must do only what they know is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Try these men first. Then let them help the church people if they have done nothing wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In the same way, their wives must be women whom people respect. They must not tell lies about anyone. They must be able to control themselves. They must live so that people can trust them in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The leaders helpers must have only one wife. They must be good leaders for their children and family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When they have done the work of a helper well, people will respect them. If they do well,  they will not fear to tell what they believe about Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am writing to you about these matters even though I hope to come to you soon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then if I do not come right away, you will know what people should do in Gods family.  This family is the church of the living God. The church people hold what is true and keeps it strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gods plan is very great as we all know. Here it is: we saw God as a man; Gods Spirit proved he was right; angels saw him; the nations were told about him; people of the world believed in him; God took him up into heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
