His disciples picked some of the grain as they went along. They cleaned it by rubbing it in their hands, and ate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Some of the Pharisees said, Why do your disciples do what is not right on the Sabbath day?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus answered them, Have you not read what David did? He and his men were hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He went into Gods house. Some bread was there for God. But David took the bread and ate it. He also gave some of it to the men who were with him. Only the priests have the right to eat that bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus said to them, The Son of Man rules over the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On another Sabbath day, Jesus went into the meeting house and taught. A man was there whose right hand was thin and weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The scribes and Pharisees watched Jesus to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day. They wanted to find something wrong about Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Jesus knew what they were thinking. He spoke to the man whose hand was thin and weak. He said, Come and stand here in front The man stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said to them, I ask you, is it right to do good things on the Sabbath day, or to do wrong things? Is it right to heal people so that they will live, or to let them die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He looked around at them all. Then he said to the man, Hold out your hand. The man did so and it was made well like the other hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisees were very angry and they talked together about what they could do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>About that time Jesus went out of the city on the hill to talk with God. He talked with God all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the morning he called his disciples to him. He chose twelve of them and called them apostles <FI>special messengers<Fi> .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They were Simon, whom Jesus called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James and John,  Philip and Bartholomew, Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the freedom fighter, Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, the one who gave Jesus over to people who hated him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jesus came down the hill with them and stood on the flat ground. Many people came. There were many of his disciples. And there were many people from all parts of Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from the seaside of Tyre and Sidon. They came to hear him and to be healed because they were sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some were troubled by bad spirits, and they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the people wanted to touch Jesus. Power came from him and he healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus looked at his disciples and said, God will make happy you who are poor. The kingdom of God is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God will make happy you who are hungry now. You will be filled. God will make happy you who cry now. You will laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>God will make you happy when people hate you, when they will not let you belong to their group, when they say wrong things about you and make your name bad. God blesses you when it is for the sake of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Be very happy on that day and dance for joy. God will be good to you in heaven. The fathers of these people did the same things to the prophets of God long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you who are rich will have trouble. You have already had your good times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You who have all you want now will have trouble! You will be hungry. You who laugh now will have trouble. You will be sad and cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When all the people praise you, you will have trouble! The fathers of these people did the same things to those who were not true prophets of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I say to you who hear, love your enemies. Do good things to those who hate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Bless those who use bad words about you. Ask God to do good to those who trouble you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If someone hits you on one side of your face, turn the other side also. If someone takes your coat, let him have your shirt also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Give to every one who begs you for something.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Do to other people what you want them to do to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If you love those who love you, what good is there in that? Even bad people love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If you do good things to those who do good things to you, what good is there in that? Bad people do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If you lend to those who will give to you, what good is there in that? Even bad people lend to bad people, if they think they will get the same from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Love your enemies. Do good things. Lend to people and do not look to get anything back. You will be paid well. You will be sons of the Highest One. He is kind to those who do not thank him and to those who are bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So be kind like your Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do not judge others and you will not be judged. Do not punish others, and you will not be punished. Let others go free and God will let you go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Give to people and they will give to you. They will fill your cup, press it down, shake it,  and let it run over. That is what they will give to you. How much you give to others is how much God will give to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus also told the people a story. He said, A blind man cannot lead a blind man. They will both fall into a hole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The one who learns is not better than his teacher. But every one who learns will be like his teacher when his teacher has finished teaching him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Why do you look at the small piece of dust in your brothers eye? And you do not see the big stick in your own eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How can you say to your brother, "Brother, let me take the dust out of your eye"? But you do not see the stick in your own eye. You are not true to yourselves! First take the stick out of your own eye. Then you will be able to see to take the dust out of your brothers eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>A good tree does not have bad fruit. And also, a bad tree does not have good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Every kind of tree is known by its fruit. People do not pick fruit like figs from thorn trees.  And they do not pick grapes from bramble bushes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>A good man has stored up good things in his heart, so he says good things. A bad man has stored up wrong things in his heart, so he will say wrong things. The mouth will say what is in the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Why do you call me "Lord, Lord," but you do not do what I tell you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A person comes to me. He hears what I say and obeys me. I will show you who he is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He is like a man who built a house. He dug down deep in the ground and made it stand on a rock. The water in the river came up high. The water beat hard against the house.  But the house did not move, because it was built on a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>A man hears what I say but does not obey me. He is like a man who built his house on top of the ground. He did not dig down deep. The water beat hard against it and it fell with a loud noise!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
