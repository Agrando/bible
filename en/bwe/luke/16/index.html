He said, A rich man had a manager in charge of his things. People told the rich man that the manager was wasting his things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>he called the manager and asked him, "What is this I hear about you? Tell me what you have done. You cannot be my manager any more."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then the manager thought to himself, "What will I do? My master is taking my work away from me. I am not strong enough to go out and dig. I am ashamed to beg.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I know what I will do. Then, when I lose my job, these people will take me into their own homes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he called to him everyone who owed his master something. He asked the first man,  "How much do you owe my master?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He answered, "A hundred tins of oil." The manager said, "Take your paper. Sit down right now and write on it fifty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he asked the next man, "How much do you owe?" He said, "A hundred bags of grain." The manager said, "Take your paper and write on it eighty."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the master praised the manager who did wrong. He praised him because he did what was wise. The people of this world are wiser than the people who have the Light.  They know how to get along with people like themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I tell you this. Money may be a wrong thing, but use it to make friends for yourselves.  Then when your money is spent, they will be glad to see you come into that place where people live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Anyone who can be trusted in a little matter can also be trusted in a big matter. Anyone who does wrong in a very little matter will do wrong also in a big matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So if you could not be trusted to use money, which is bad, who will trust you to use true riches?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If you could not be trusted with what belonged to another person, who will give you something for yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No servant can work for two masters. He will hate one and love the other. Or he will obey one and despise the other. You cannot work for both God and money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Pharisees loved money. They heard all these things. They made fun of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, You try to make men think you are all right. But God knows your hearts. What men think is fine, God hates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Law and the Prophets gave Gods word until John came. Since then, the good news of Gods kingdom has been told. And now everyone tries hard to get into the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It would be easier to take away the sky and the earth than for the smallest part of the law to fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If a man sends away his wife and marries another woman, he commits adultery. And if the man marries a woman who has been sent away by her husband, he commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was a rich man who dressed and lived like a king every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A poor man named Lazarus was put at his door. He had many sores on his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He wanted to eat the pieces of food that fell from the rich mans table. Dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The poor man died. Angels carried him to be with Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He was in great pain in the world of dead people. He looked up and saw Abraham far away. With him was Lazarus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He called out, "Father Abraham, help me! Send Lazarus to dip his finger in some water and cool my tongue. This fire is very hot for me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham said to him, "Son, remember this. You had a good time when you were living. Lazarus had a bad time when he was living. But now he is happy here and you are in pain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But that is not all. A wide hole is between you and us. No one can go from here to you if he wanted to. And no one can come from where you are to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The rich man said, "Then, father, I beg you, send Lazarus to my fathers house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I have five brothers there. Tell him to talk to them so that they will not come to this place where there is pain."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Abraham said, "They have Moses and the Prophets. They can listen to them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He answered, "No, father Abraham! But if a man who had died went to them, they would stop their wrong ways."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Abraham said, "If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, then they will not believe, even if a man were raised from death."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
