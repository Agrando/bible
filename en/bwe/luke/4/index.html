He left the Jordan River, and the Spirit led him into the desert for forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The devil tried to make him do wrong. Jesus did not eat in those forty days. Then he was very hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The devil said to him, If you are Gods Son, tell this stone to be changed into bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "Man cannot live on bread only."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The devil took Jesus to a high place where he could see all the countries of the world at one time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to Jesus, I will give you the right to rule over all these countries. They will make you great. All this has been given to me. I can give it to anyone I want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So, if you worship and give honour to me, all will be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "You must worship the Lord your God and he is the only one you are to worship."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The devil took Jesus to Jerusalem. He put him on a high part of the temple. He said to him, If you are Gods Son, jump down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The holy writings say, "God will tell his angels to take care of you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And "They will hold you up in their hands so that you will not knock your foot on a stone."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jesus answered him, The holy writings say, "You must not test the Lord your God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When the devil finished all his testing, he left him for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus had the power of the Spirit when he went back to Galilee. People talked about him in all that part of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He taught them in their meeting houses. All the people praised him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He went to Nazareth where he had grown up. He went to the meeting house as he always did on the Sabbath day. He stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A man gave him the book that Isaiah the prophet of God wrote long ago. He opened the book and found the place where it says,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Spirit of the Lord is on me because he chose me to tell the good news to poor people. He has sent me to tell the prisoners they can go free, and to tell the blind people they can see. He has sent me to set free those who have been wrongly held down,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and to tell people that the year when the Lord will help them has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Jesus closed the book and gave it back to the man. He sat down. Everyone in the meeting house was watching him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He began to talk to them. He said, You have heard what the holy writings say. They have come true today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They all began to talk about him. They were surprised to hear him say such good words.  They asked, Is not this Josephs son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus said, I know that you will say this to me "Doctor, heal yourself. We have heard what you did in Capernaum. Do the same things here in your own country."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he went on to say, I tell you the truth. No prophet of God is accepted by the people in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I tell you the truth. At the time of Elijah, there were many women in Israel whose husbands were dead. There was no rain for three years and six months. All over the country there was great trouble because there was no food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Elijah was not sent to any of these widowed women in Israel. He was sent to a widow at Zarephath in Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Also while Elisha was the prophet of God, many people in Israel had leprosy <FI>a bad skin disease<Fi> . None of them was healed. The only one who was healed was Naaman from the country of Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When they heard this, all the people in the meeting house were very angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They jumped to their feet and put Jesus out of the town. Their town was built on a hill.  They took Jesus out to the top and wanted to throw him down the hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Jesus walked out between them and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus went to the town of Capernaum in Galilee. He taught the people there on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They were surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house. He called in a loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He said, Jesus from Nazareth! What do you want to do to us? Have you come to kill us?  I know who you are. You are Gods Holy Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to him, Be quiet! Come out of him! The bad spirit threw the man down in front of them. He came out of the man and did not hurt him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>All the people were very much surprised. They said to each other, What kind of talk is this? He can make bad spirits obey him. He tells them to come out and they come out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The people in all the places around Capernaum heard about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus left the meeting house and went to Simons house. The mother of Simons wife was sick with a bad fever. They asked Jesus to help her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He went and stood beside her. He told the fever to leave her. It left. She got up right away and began to do things for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When the sun went down, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick in any way. He put his hands on every one of them and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The bad spirits also came out of many people. They called out, You are the Son of God!  But he stopped them. He would not let them talk because they knew that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The next morning Jesus went away to a place by himself. The people went to look for him. When they found him, they did not want him to leave them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But he said to them, I must tell the good news to the people in other towns also. It is the news of Gods kingdom. I was sent to tell this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he told Gods word in the meeting houses in the Galilee area.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
