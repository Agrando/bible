But the person who makes another person do wrong will have trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A big stone should be tied around his neck and then he should be thrown into the sea.  That would be better for him than to make one of these little children do wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Take care! If your brother does something bad, tell him what he has done. If he is sorry,  then forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Maybe he will do wrong to you seven times in one day. But if he comes to you seven times in one day and says, "I am sorry for what I did," then you must forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The apostles said to the Lord, Help us to believe more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Lord said, If you believe as much as a little mustard seed, then you can say to this tree, "Come up by the roots and plant yourself in the sea." And it would obey you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If your servant is working in the field or taking care of sheep, what will you say to him when he comes in from the field? Will you say, "Come now and sit down to eat"?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>No, you will say, "Get my food ready. Get ready to wait on me. I will eat and drink. After that, then you may eat and drink."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will you thank the servant for doing what you told him to do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It is the same with you. When you have done all you were told to do, you should say,  "We are servants. We have not done a big thing. We have only done what we should do."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus was going on the road to Jerusalem. He went between the countries of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy came to him. They stood far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they called out, Jesus, Master, help us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus saw them, he said to them, Go and let the priests look at you. While they were going, they were healed of the leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>One of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back. He praised God with a loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He bowed down in front of Jesus and thanked him. He was a man from the country of Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Jesus asked, Were not ten people healed? Where are the other nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is this stranger the only one who has come back to praise God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he said to the man, Get up and go on your way. You were healed because you believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Pharisees asked Jesus, When will the kingdom of God come? He answered them,  You cannot see the kingdom of God when it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>People will not be able to say, "Look, here it is!" or "There it is! That is because the kingdom of God is inside you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to his disciples, The time will come when you will want to see one of the days of the Son of Man. But you will not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>People will say to you, "Look! Here he is!" or "Look! There he is!" But do not go out or follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When lightning comes, it lights up the whole sky. It will be like that on the day when the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he will have much trouble. The people who are living now will not believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The way it was in the time of Noah is the way it will be in the time of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>People ate and drank. They married and gave their daughters to be married. All this went on until the day when Noah went into his house built on a boat. Then there was much water and all the people outside the boat died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>It was the same way in the time of Lot. People ate and drank. They bought and sold.  They planted and built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then one day Lot went out of the city of Sodom. Then on that day fire and burning rock came down from the sky and killed all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That is the way it will be on the day when the Son of Man is seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>On that day a man will be at the top of his house, and his things will be below. But he must not go down to get his things. In the same way a man will be in the field, but he must not go back home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember what happened to Lots wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Anyone who wants to keep his life will lose it. And anyone who gives up his life will keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you, on that night two people may be in one bed. One will be taken away and the other will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two women will be making flour together. One woman will be taken away and the other woman will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Two men will be in a field. One man will be taken away and the other man will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They asked him, Where will this be, Lord? He said, The big birds that eat meat will go to the place where the dead body is.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
