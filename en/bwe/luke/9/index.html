He gave them power over all the bad spirits,  and power to heal sick people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He sent them out to tell people about the kingdom of God and to heal sick people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He said, Take nothing with you for your trip. Do not take a walking stick, or a bag, or food, or money. And do not take two shirts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When you go into a certain house, stay there until you leave the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Some people might not take you in. When you leave that town, shake the dust off your feet. That will be a sign to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The disciples left and went through the towns. They told the good news and healed people everywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Herod the ruler heard about all that was happening. He did not know what to think.  Some people said John the Baptizer had risen from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Some people said Elijah had come back. And other people said that one of the old prophets of God had risen from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Herod said, I cut off Johns head. Now who is this man of whom I hear such things? He wanted to see Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When the apostles came back, they told Jesus all they had done. He took them away with him and they went by themselves to a town called Bethsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the people found out and they followed him. He was glad to see them and talked to them about Gods kingdom. He healed those who were sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When it was late in the day, the twelve disciples came to him. They said, Send the people away so they can go to the towns and the farms to sleep and get something to eat.  This is a lonely place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jesus said to them, You give them food to eat. They said, All we have is five loaves of bread and two fish. Shall we go and buy food for all these people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, Tell the people to sit down in groups of fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They did what he said, and they made all the people sit down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He took the five loaves of bread and the two fish. He looked up to heaven and thanked God for them. Then he broke the bread. He gave it to the disciples to give to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They all ate and had enough. They picked up twelve baskets full of pieces that were left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>One day Jesus was alone talking to God. His disciples were there too. He asked them,  Who do people say I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They answered, Some people say you are John the Baptizer. Others say you are Elijah.  And others say that one of the old prophets of God has risen from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus said, But who do you say I am? Peter answered, You are the Christ sent by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to them, Do not tell this to anyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then he went on to say, The Son of Man will have much trouble. The leaders of the people, the chief priests, and the scribes will not believe him. He will be killed. On the third day he will be raised from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He said to all the people, If anyone wants to come with me, he must leave what he himself wants to do. Every day he must take up his cross <FI>be ready to die<Fi> and come with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Anyone who tries to keep his life will lose it. And anyone who gives up his life for my sake will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>What good will it do a man if he gets the whole world for himself but loses his life or spoils it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone is ashamed of me and the things I say, the Son of man will be ashamed of that person when he comes. The Son of man will come with his holy angels and be great like his Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I tell you the truth. Some people are standing here who will not die before they see the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>About eight days after saying these things, Jesus went up on a hill to talk with God. He took Peter, John, and James with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As he was talking with God, he was changed. His face was different. His clothes became very white and shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then two men were talking with Jesus. They were Moses and Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Light was shining from them. They talked about his leaving this world. That would happen when he was in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Peter and the others were very sleepy. They woke up and saw the light shining from Jesus. And they saw the two men standing with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him, Master, it is good for us to be here.  Let us make three places here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah. Peter did not know what he was saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As he said this, a cloud came over them. They were very much afraid when the cloud came around them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A voice in the cloud said, This is my dear Son. Listen to him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The talking stopped. Then Jesus was left alone. The disciples did not say anything. They did not tell anyone at that time what they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The next day they came down the hill. Many people met him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>One man among them called out, Teacher, I beg you, look at my son. He is my only child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A bad spirit takes hold of him and he screams. It throws him around and makes him foam at his mouth. It beats him badly and does not want to leave him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I begged your disciples to drive the bad spirit out, but they could not do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said, You people today do not believe. You have turned away from God. How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>While he was coming, the bad spirit knocked him down and threw him around. Jesus told the spirit to stop. He healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>All the people were surprised to see that God has so much power. While the people were wondering about everything Jesus did, he talked to his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He said, Listen well to what I say. The Son of Man will be given over to men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But they did not understand what he said. The meaning was hidden from them so they would not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The disciples started talking among themselves. They quarrelled about which of them was the greatest person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he took a child and put him by his side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then he said, If anyone takes in a child like this for my sake, he takes in me. And if anyone takes in me, he takes in the one who sent me. The one who takes the least or lowest place among you is the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>John answered, Master, we saw a man driving bad spirits out of people. He was using your name. We told him to stop because he is not one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus said, Do not stop him. Anyone who is not against you is on your side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>The time was near for Jesus to be taken up to heaven. Then he started off for Jerusalem.  He sent messengers ahead of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They went to one of the towns of the Samaritan people to get ready for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>But the people would not take him in because he was going to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When the disciples James and John saw that, they said, Lord, do you want us to ask for fire to come down from the sky and burn them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he turned and said to them, Stop that! You do not think about what kind of spirit you are showing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The Son of Man did not come to kill people, but to save them. And they went on to another town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As they went along on the road, a man said to him, I will go anywhere you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said, Foxes have holes to live in. Birds have nests. But the Son of Man has no place to lie down to rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Jesus said to another man who followed him, Come with me. But the man said, Lord,  let me go first and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Jesus said to him, Let those who are dead bury their own dead people. As for you, go and tell people about Gods kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Another man said to Jesus, Sir, I will go with you. But let me go first to my home and tell them I am going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus said to him, Any person who starts doing something and then keeps looking back is not fit for the kingdom of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
