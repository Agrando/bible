They said, This man is leading our people to do wrong. He says we should not pay taxes to Caesar. He says that he is Christ, a King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Pilate asked Jesus, Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus answered, Yes, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate said to the chief priests and to the people, I find nothing wrong in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they said all the more, He troubles the people by his teaching. He has been teaching people in all the country of Judea. He began in Galilee and has come as far as this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Pilate heard this, he asked, Is this man from Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he knew that he came from Herods country, he sent him to Herod. Herod was in Jerusalem at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He was glad to see Jesus. He had heard about him. And he had wanted to see him for a long time. He was hoping that he would see Jesus do a big work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He asked Jesus many questions. But Jesus did not answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The chief priests and the scribes stood near. They brought strong complaints against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Herod and his soldiers laughed at Jesus and made fun of him. He dressed him up in very fine clothes and sent him back to Pilate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Herod and Pilate became friends that day. Before that, they had hated each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Pilate then called the chief priests, and the rulers, and the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said to them, You brought this man to me. You said he is leading your people to do wrong. I have asked questions here in front of you. I have found nothing wrong in this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Herod did the same. He sent him back to us. This man has done nothing for which he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So I will beat him and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At the feast Pilate always let one man go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But they all shouted, Kill this man! Let Barabbas go free for us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(Barabbas had been put in prison because he led some people who had been fighting in the city. He had killed a man.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Pilate talked to the people again. He wanted to let Jesus go free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But they shouted, Nail him to a cross! Nail him to a cross!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate said to them the third time, Why, what wrong thing has he done? I have not found any wrong thing for which he should die. So I will beat him and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they shouted all the more loudly, saying, Nail him to a cross! And Pilate gave in to their shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he said they could have it their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He let the other man go free. (He was the one who had been put in prison because he fought and had killed a man. He was the one the people asked Pilate to let go free.) And Pilate did to Jesus what they wanted him to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They took Jesus away. On the way, they caught a man who was coming in from the farms. His name was Simon. He was born in the country of Cyrene. They made him walk behind Jesus and carry his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Many people followed him. Women cried and were sorry for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus turned to them and said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not cry for me. But cry for yourselves and for your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The time will come when people will say, "Happy are the women who have no children or who have never had a child."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then people will begin to say to the big hills, "Fall on us." They will say to the small hills,  "Hide us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If this is what people do when the wood is new, what will they do when it is old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Two men were also led away to be killed with Jesus. They were bad men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They came to the place called Calvary (the head bone.) There they nailed the two bad men to the crosses also. They put one man on the right side of Jesus and one man on the left side of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said, Father, forgive them! They do not know what they are doing. The soldiers played a game to see how they should divide his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The people stood around watching. But the rulers made fun of him. They said, He saved other people. He should save himself if he is Gods Christ, Gods chosen one!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The soldiers made fun of him. They came and brought him wine to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said, If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The sign that was put above Jesus head said, This is the King of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>One of the bad men who was hanging there said wrong things against Jesus. He said If you are the Christ, why do you not save yourself and us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the other bad man told him to stop. He said, Do you not even fear God? You are being punished just as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>It is right for us to be punished because we have done wrong things. But this man has done nothing bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when you become a King.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jesus said to him, I tell you the truth. Today you will be with me in Gods garden of paradise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>About noontime the whole land became dark and stayed dark for three hours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The sun did not shine. The big cloth that hung in the temple was torn into two pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jesus called out loud, Father, I put my spirit into your hands! When he had said this, he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The captain saw all this. Then he praised God. He said, Surely, this was a good man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Many people were around there to look on. When they saw what happened, they all went home beating their chests <FI>because they were sad<Fi> .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>All Jesus friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood far away.  They saw all of this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>There was a man named Joseph. He was a member of the court. He was a good man who lived the right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He had not wanted the people to do what they did. He was looking for the kingdom of God. He was from a town of the Jews, called Arimathea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He took the body down from the cross. He wrapped it in a linen cloth and laid it in a grave cut in a rock. No one had ever been put in this grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>It was the day before the Sabbath. And it was almost time for the Sabbath to begin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Some women had come with Jesus from Galilee. They followed and saw the grave where his body was put.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Then they went back and got things ready to put on his body. These things were spices that smelled very nice, and sweet kinds of oil. On the Sabbath day they rested as the law said they should.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
