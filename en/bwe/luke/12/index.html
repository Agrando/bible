They stepped on each other. Jesus began to talk to the disciples. He said, Take care. Do not let the yeast of the Pharisees spoil you. They are not true to themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Everything that is covered up will be seen. Everything that is hidden will be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>What you have said in the dark will be heard in the light. What you have said in secret with the door shut will be told from the tops of the houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are my friends. I tell you, do not fear people who can kill your bodies. After that they cannot do anything more to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will tell you whom you must fear. Fear the one who, after he has killed, has the power to throw into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Are not five sparrows sold for a tiny sum of money? Yet God does not forget about one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Even the number of hairs on your head is known. So do not fear. You are worth more than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I tell you. If anyone tells people that he knows me, the Son of Man will also tell the angels of God that he knows him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if anyone tells people he does not know me, the Son of Man will also tell the angels of God that he does not know that person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Everyone who says anything against the Son of Man will be forgiven. But anyone who says wrong things against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When men take you to the meeting houses and to the rulers and to the courts, do not be troubled about what you will answer or say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Holy Spirit will teach you at the right time what you must say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>One of the people in the crowd said, Teacher, tell my brother to divide with me the things my father left when he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus said, Man, who made me a judge over you or gave me power to divide your things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said to the people, Take care. Do not be greedy in any way to get more and more things. Even if a man has much more than he needs, it cannot give him life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then he told them a story. He said, A rich man had a farm. The things that grew on it were many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to himself, "What will I do? I have no place to keep all the food I have grown."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he said, "This is what I will do. I will break down my storehouses and build bigger ones. I will keep in them all the food and everything I have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I will say to myself, Man, you have much in your storehouses for many years. Rest now. Eat, drink, and have a good time."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said to him, "You are a fool! Tonight you will die. Then who will have all the things you have kept for yourself?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So anyone who keeps things for himself is not rich in the way God wants him to be rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jesus said to his disciples, So I tell you this. Do not be troubled about what you will eat to keep alive. Do not be troubled about clothes to wear on your body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Life itself is worth more than food, and the body is worth more than clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Think of the birds. They do not plant, cut, or keep any food. Yet God feeds them. You are worth much more than the birds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Can any of you live any longer by troubling yourself about these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If you cannot do a small thing like that, why do you trouble yourself about the other things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Think about the flowers. See how they grow. They do not work or make cloth. I tell you, King Solomon was a great man. But he was not dressed as fine as one of these flowers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>God dresses the grass in the fields so it looks nice. It is in the field one day and the next day it is burned. If God dresses the grass like that, he cares much more that you have clothes to wear. You do not believe in God very much!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Do not keep asking, "What shall we eat?" and, "What shall we drink?" Do not be troubled about that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>All the people who are not Jews work for these things. Your Father in heaven knows that you need them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But work for Gods kingdom. Then you will have all these things also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Do not fear, little family. Your Father wants to give the kingdom to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell what you have and give it to poor people. Make for yourselves money bags that will not wear out. Keep the things you like in heaven. They will not be lost there. People cannot go in and steal them, and insects cannot spoil them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The place where you keep the things you like is where your heart will be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Be dressed and have your lamps lit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from a wedding. They are ready to open the door as soon as he comes and knocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Happy the servants who are ready when the master comes! The servants who are ready when the master comes will be made happy. I tell you the truth. The master will get ready to serve them. He will set them at the table and will come and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He may come in the middle of the night or when it is nearly morning. But if they are watching for the master, they will be happy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And remember this. If the owner of a house knew at what time a man would come to steal, he would not let the man break into his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So then, be ready. The Son of Man will come at a time when you are not looking for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Peter said, Lord, are you telling this story for us or for all the people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The Lord said, Who is like a wise servant who can be trusted? His master will put him in charge of his other servants. He gives them food to eat at the right time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>His master will bless that servant if he is doing this when he comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>I tell you the truth. His master will put him in charge of all that he has</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But perhaps that servant says to himself, "My master will not come just now." Then he begins to beat the other servants. He begins to eat and drink until he is drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>If he does that, his master will come on a day when he is not looking for him. He will not know the time when his master is coming. His master will punish him very much and put him away with those he cannot trust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>A servant knew what his master wanted. But he was not ready. He did not do what his master wanted him to do. So he will be beaten much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if a servant did not know and did something bad, he will be beaten only a little. To whom much has been given, from him much will be asked. When people give much to anyone, they will ask more from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I came to start a fire on the earth. I wish the fire were already burning!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>I will be going through a big trouble, and I feel like a prisoner until it is all over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Do you think that I came to bring peace on the earth? I tell you, "No". I came to take away peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>From now, if there are five in a family, they will be against each other. Three of them will be against the other two. And two of them will be against the other three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>A father will be against his son, and the son will be against his father. The mother will be against her daughter, and the daughter will be against her mother. A mans mother will be against his wife, and his wife will be against his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus also said to the people, When you see a cloud coming up in the west, you say right away, "Rain is coming." And it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When the wind is blowing from the south, you say, "It will be very hot." And it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>You are not true to yourselves! You know the meaning of these signs in the earth and sky. But you do not know the meaning of the signs about the time in which we are living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Why do you not judge for yourselves what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>If someone wants to take you to court, make an agreement with him quickly on the way.  If you do not, he will take you to the judge. The judge will give you to the guard, and the guard will put you in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell you, you will not get out of prison until you have paid up every piece of money.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
