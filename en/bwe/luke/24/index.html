They took with them the things they had made ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They saw that the stone was rolled away from the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So they went in. But they did not see the body of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They were troubled about this. Then they saw two men standing near them. They were dressed in white clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The women were afraid and bowed their faces down to the ground. The men said to them, Why do you look for a living person among dead people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here. He has risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said that the Son of Man would be given over to bad men. He would be nailed to a cross, and he would rise on the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then they remembered what he had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They left the grave and went back. They told all these things to the eleven disciples and to all the other people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The women who told these things to the apostles were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women who were with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Peter got up and ran to the grave. He bowed down and looked in. He saw the linen clothes lying there, but nothing more. Then he left, wondering about what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>That same day, two of the disciples were going to the town called Emmaus. It was about two hours walk from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They were talking together about all the things that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>While they were talking and asking each other questions, Jesus himself came and walked with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But even though they saw him, they did not know who he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus asked them, What is this that you are talking about as you walk along looking so sad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One of them named Cleophas answered him. He said, Are you a stranger in Jerusalem and do not know what has happened there these last days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus said, What things?" They said, All that has happened to Jesus of Nazareth. He was a prophet of God. He had power to do big works and to teach the people. He was respected by God and all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Our chief priests and rulers gave him over to be punished by death, and they nailed him to a cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But we were hoping that he was the one who would free the people of Israel. But that is not all. This is the third day since they did it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Some of our women told us things that surprised us. Early this morning they were at the grave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They did not find his body there. They came back and said that they saw angels. The angels told them that Jesus was living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Some of us went to the grave. And they found everything just as the women said. But they did not see Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he said to them, You foolish men! Your hearts are slow to believe all that the prophets of God have said long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Christ had to have this trouble and go to the place where he will be great, did he not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he told them the meaning of all that Moses and all the prophets of God long ago had written about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They came near the village to which they were going. It looked as if he was going on further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But they begged him not to go further. They said, Stay with us. It will soon be night. The day is almost finished. So he went in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He sat down at the table with them. Then he took the bread and thanked God for it. He broke it and gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they saw who he was. They knew him. And then suddenly they could not see him any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They said to each other, It was like a fire burning in our hearts when he talked to us on the road and told us the meaning of the holy writings!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They got up right then and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples together. Some other people were with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These people said, The Lord has really risen! He came to Simon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the men from Emmaus told them what had happened on the road. They told how they knew Jesus when he broke bread and gave it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While they were telling them this, Jesus himself stood there with them. He said to them,  Peace to you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They were troubled and afraid. They thought they were seeing a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He said to them, Why are you troubled? Why do you wonder about these things in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Look at my hands and my feet. You can see that it is I myself. Touch me with your hands and see. A spirit does not have a body and bones as you see I have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They gave him a piece of cooked fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He took the fish and ate it in front of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he said, I told you this while I was with you. I told you that things were written about me in the books of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms. And I told you that all of these things must come true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then he taught them so that they understood the things in the holy writings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said, It is written that the Christ must have trouble. On the third day he will rise from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Men will talk in his name to people in all countries. They will tell them to stop their wrong ways and ask to be forgiven. They will begin in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You are the men who have seen these things, and will tell people about them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I will send you what the Father has promised to give you. So wait in the city of Jerusalem until you have been given power from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus led the disciples out as far as the town of Bethany. He put up his hands and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>While he was blessing them, he left them. He was taken up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>They bowed down and worshipped him. They were very happy and went back to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Every day they were in the temple praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>missing fehlt/missing</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
