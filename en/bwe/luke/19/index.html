He was the head tax collector, and he was a rich man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He wanted to see who Jesus was but he could not see him because he was a short man and there were many people around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So he ran ahead and climbed into a tree to see Jesus, for he was coming that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up. He said, Zacchaeus, come down right now.  I must stay at your house today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Zacchaeus came down right then. He was glad to have Jesus come in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When all the people saw this, they did not like it. They said, He has gone to visit a bad man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, Look, Lord, I will give to the poor people half of all I have. And if I have cheated anyone, I will give him back four times as much as I took.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said to him, The head of this house has been saved today! He also is a son of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Son of Man came to look for and to save those who are lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>While they were listening to this, he started to tell them a story. He did so because they were near Jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of God would begin right away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So he said, A man who belonged to a respected family went to a country far away. He went to get power to rule. Then he was going to come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Before he left, he called ten of his servants. He gave each of them some money. He said,  "Go and trade with this money until I come back."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His people hated him. They chose some men and sent them after him to tell the king,  "We do not want this man to rule over us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he was given the power to rule and came back. Then he called the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much money each one had made by trading.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The first one came to him and said, "Sir, your money has made ten times more money."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The ruler said, "You have done well. You are a good servant. You will rule over ten cities because you have done well with a very small thing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The second one came to him and said, "Sir, your money has made five times more money."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The ruler said, "You will rule over five cities."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then another servant came and said, "Sir, here is your money. I hid it in a cloth and kept it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I was afraid of you. You are a hard man. You take in where you put nothing out. You gather where you did not plant."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The ruler said "You bad servant! I will judge you by your own words. You knew that I was a hard man! You knew that I take in where I put nothing out. You knew that I gather where I did not plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Why did you not put my money in the bank? Then when you came home I would have had my money with interest."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some men were standing there. He said to them, "Take the money from him. Give it to the man who has ten times as much."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said, "Sir, he has ten times as much already!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The ruler said, "I tell you. Anyone who has some will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But where are those people who hate me and did not want me to rule over them? Bring them here and kill them right here in front of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When Jesus had said this, he went on ahead of them towards Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He came near Bethphage and Bethany by the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then he sent two of his disciples ahead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He said, Go into the village in front of you. As soon as you go in, you will find an animal tied up. No one has ever sat on it. Untie it and bring it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If anyone asks you, "Why are you untying it?" tell him, "The Lord needs it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They went and found it just as Jesus had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they were untying the animal, the men who owned it asked them, Why are you untying the animal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They said, The Lord needs it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They brought it to Jesus and laid their coats on it. Then they put Jesus on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As he was riding along, people spread their coats on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>He came near the top of the hill called the Mount of Olives. Then all the people who believed in him began to be happy. They sang out loudly, and praised God in a loud voice for all the big works they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They said, God bless the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven where God is praised!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Some of the Pharisees who were among the people said to Jesus, Teacher, tell your disciples to stop saying that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus answered, I tell you, if they do not speak like this the stones will call out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When Jesus came near, he saw the city. His heart was very sad and he cried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He said, I wish you knew today what things would give you peace! But now you do not see what they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The time will come when the people who hate you will put a wall all around you. They will shut you up and keep you in on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>They will break you down to the ground. They will kill the people within you. They will not leave one stone of your houses on top of another. That will happen because you did not know the time when God was ready to help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Jesus went into the temple. He began to drive out the people who were buying and selling in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He said to them, It is written, "My house shall be a place where people talk with God."  But you have made it a place for people who steal!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He taught in the temple every day. The chief priests, scribes and the leaders of the people wanted to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But they did not find any way they could do it. All the people stayed around to hear what Jesus said.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
