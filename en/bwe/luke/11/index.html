When he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to talk with God as John taught his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jesus said, When you talk with God, say, "Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. May your kingdom come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Give us our food day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Forgive us for the wrong things we have done. We forgive everyone who has done wrong to us. Do not lead us to be tested."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus said to them, Maybe one of you has a friend. You go to him in the middle of the night and say to him, "Friend, lend me three loaves of bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A friend has come to my house. He has been on the road. I have no food to give him to eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Maybe the friend in the house answers you and says, "Do not trouble me. The door is locked. And my children and I are in bed. I cannot get up and give you anything."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I tell you this. Maybe he will not give him anything because he is his friend. But he will get up and give him what he needs because he keeps on asking for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I tell you, ask and you will get what you ask for. Look and you will find what you look for. Knock and the door will be opened for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Everyone who asks will get. The one who looks will find. And the one who knocks will have the door opened for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Which of you fathers will give your son a snake if he asks for a fish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Will you give him a scorpion <FI>an insect with a sting<Fi> if he asks for an egg?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You are wrong and yet you know how to give good things to your children. Much more,  the Father in heaven will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus was driving a bad spirit out of a man who could not talk. When the spirit left him,  the man could talk. The people were surprised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some of them said, This man drives out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub, the chief of bad spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Other people wanted to test Jesus. They asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said, If one part of any country fights against the other part of the country, that country is spoiled. And if one part of any family fights against the other part of the family, it cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If Satan fights against himself, how will his kingdom stand? You say I drive out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If I drive out bad spirits by the help of Beelzebub, by whose help do your own people drive them out? Your own people will judge you for this!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I drive out bad spirits by the help of God, then know this, Gods kingdom is here with you now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A strong man has something in his hand to fight. He guards his place. He will not lose his things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when a stronger man comes, he catches the man who guards his house. He will take away what is in the mans hand. And he will take his things and give them to his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Anyone who is not with me is against me. Anyone who does not work with me, works against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When a bad spirit has gone out of a man, he goes through dry places. He looks for a place to rest, but he does not find any. Then he says, "I will go back to my house from where I came."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he comes back, he finds it clean and all fixed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he goes and brings seven other spirits who are worse than he is. They go in and live there. Now the man is worse than he was at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As he said this, a woman among the people called out, Happy is your mother who gave birth to you, and fed you as a baby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Jesus said, Happy are those who hear Gods word and obey it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>More and more people were coming. He started to talk. He said, People today are bad.  They want a sign. No sign will be given them but the sign of Jonah the prophet of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jonah was a sign to the men in the city of Nineveh. In the same way the Son of Man will be a sign to the people today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the people are judged, the Queen from the South will stand up and speak against men who live today. She came a long way to hear the wise words of Solomon. The one who is here is greater than Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When people are judged, the men of Nineveh will stand up and speak against the people of today. They stopped their wrong ways when Jonah told them Gods word. And the one who is here is greater than Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>No person lights a lamp and hides it in a hole or puts it under a basket. But he puts it on a place for a lamp. Then people who come in can see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Your body gets its light through your eyes. When you have good eyes, all your body has light. But when your eyes are bad, your body is in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So be sure that it is not dark in you where it should be light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If no part of your body is dark, it will all be light. It will be like a lamp that shines to give you light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>While Jesus was saying these things, a Pharisee asked him to come to eat at his house. So Jesus went in and sat at the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The Pharisee saw that Jesus did not wash his hands before he ate. He was surprised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The Lord said to him, You Pharisees wash the outside of a cup and a dish clean. But inside you are full of greed and wrong ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You are fools! Did not God make the outside and inside also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Do good, and do it from your heart. Then everything is clean for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>You Pharisees will have trouble! You give to God a tenth part of small garden plants. But you do not judge in the right way. And you do not love God. You should do these things and the other things too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You Pharisees will have trouble! In the meeting houses you want to sit in the front seats.  And in the market you want people to greet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You will have trouble! You are not true to yourselves! You are like graves that are not marked. Men walk over them and do not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then one of the men who taught Gods law said to Jesus, Teacher, when you say these things, you talk against us too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jesus said, You men will have trouble also! You put heavy loads on peoples backs. But you yourselves will not put up one finger to help carry the loads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>You will have trouble! You build places to bury the prophets of God that your fathers killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>In this way you show you agree to the things your fathers did. They killed the prophets,  and you build places to bury them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>That is why God, who is wise, said, "I will send prophets and messengers to them. They will kill some of them. And they will trouble some of them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So the people who are living now will be punished for all the blood of the prophets of God that is on the ground since the world was made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I mean all the blood from the time of Abel to the time of Zechariah. (He was killed between the holy table and the temple.) Yes, I tell you. The people who are living now will be punished for all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>You teachers of Gods law will have trouble! You have taken away the key of the door where people can go in and know what is true. You yourselves did not go in, and you stopped those who were going in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When Jesus left the house, the scribes and Pharisees began to be very angry with him.  They asked him questions about many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>They wanted him to say something that was wrong so they could make trouble for him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
