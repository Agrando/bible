And these men helped tell the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have tried to find out all that has happened from the beginning. And so, Theophilus,  great ruler, I myself will write you the whole story.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then you will know that the things people have told you are true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah. He was one of a group of priests, and Abijah was their leader. Zechariahs wife Elizabeth came from the family of Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Both of them were good people as God saw them. They obeyed all the laws and the things that the Lord said they should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But they had no children. Elizabeth was not able to have a baby and they were both very old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Zechariah was doing his work one day as a priest to God. It was time for his group to do the work in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The priests had a certain way of dividing their work. This day it was Zechariahs turn to go into the temple of the Lord and burn the incense <FI>that smells sweet when it is burned<Fi> .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>All the people were talking to God outside the temple at this time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>An angel of the Lord came to Zechariah. He was standing on the right side of the incense table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Zechariah saw him, he was surprised and afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the angel said, Do not be afraid, Zechariah. You have been talking to God. He has heard you. Your wife Elizabeth will have a son. Name him John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You will be glad and happy. Many people will be glad when he is born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He will be great in the way the Lord calls people great. He must not drink wine or any strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the time he is born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He will go ahead of the Lord. He will have the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children. And he will bring back the people who do not obey,  so that they will want to do what good people do. He will make people ready for the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Zechariah said to the angel, How can I know that this will happen? I am an old man and my wife is also old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The angel answered him, I am Gabriel and I stand before God. I have been sent to talk to you and to bring you this good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now listen. You will be silent and not be able to talk until the day that all this has happened. This is because you did not believe what I told you. At the right time all that I said will come true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the temple. They were surprised that he stayed in so long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When he came out, he could not talk to them. They knew that he had seen something in the temple. He made signs to them with his hands and did not talk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When his time for doing the work of a priest was finished, Zechariah went home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After that, his wife Elizabeth found she was going to have a baby. For five months she stayed away from people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>She said to herself, The Lord has done this for me. At this time he has remembered me so that I need not be ashamed among people anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Elizabeth was now in her sixth month. God sent the angel Gabriel to the town of Nazareth in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The angel was sent to a young woman there. Her name was Mary. She was promised to a man named Joseph, to be his wife. He was of Davids family line.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The angel went into the house and said to her, Be happy! God has blessed you more than other women. The Lord is with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>What the angel said troubled Mary. She wondered what this greeting meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary. God has blessed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You will have a baby son. Name him Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He will be a great man. He will be called the Son of the Highest One <FI>a name for God<Fi> .  The Lord God will make him king where his father David was king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will be king over the people of Israel for ever. He will never stop being king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Mary said to the angel, How can this happen? I have no husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come to you. The power of the Highest One will be over you. That is why the holy child who is to be born will be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Your cousin Elizabeth is also going to have a baby son, though she is an old woman.  This is the sixth month for her. She is one whom people said would not have a baby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But God can do anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Mary said, I am the Lords servant. Let it be as you have said. Then the angel left her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>At that time, Mary got ready and went as quickly as she could to the hill country. She went to a town in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>She went into the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When Elizabeth heard Marys greeting, the baby in her moved. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>She said in a loud voice, God has made you happy and blessed you more than all other women. He has blessed your baby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Who am I that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Listen! When I heard your greeting, the baby inside me moved because he was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>She who has believed what was told her is blessed. What the Lord said to her will come true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Mary said, My heart is praising the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And my spirit is happy because God has saved me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He has remembered his servant even though she is not a great person. From now on all people of all times will say God has blessed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He who has all power has done a big work for me. His name is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He is kind to people of all times who respect him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He has shown how strong he is with his arm. He has taken away people who were proud in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He has moved big rulers from power, and those that were not great he has made great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He has given hungry people good things to eat, and sent away the rich people with nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He has helped his servant Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He has remembered to be kind just as he said to our fathers of long ago. He promised to be kind to Abraham and his childrens children for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three months. Then she went home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The time had now come for Elizabeths child to be born. She had a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>When her neighbours and family heard that the Lord had been so kind to her, they were glad, too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>On the eighth day people came to circumcise <FI>make a special mark on<Fi> the child. They were going to name him Zechariah like his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But his mother said, No, his name is to be John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>They said to her, But no one in your family has that name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>They made signs to the father to find out what name he wanted the child to have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>He asked for something to write on. He wrote, His name is John. They were all surprised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Right then he opened his mouth and his tongue was free. He began to speak and to praise God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Everyone who lived around there began to wonder at these things. And everywhere in the hill country of Judea, all these things were talked about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>All those who heard them thought much about them. They said, What will this child be some day? They said this because the power of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke words from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>He said, Praise the Lord God of Israel! He has remembered his people, and set them free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>He has chosen one from the family of his servant David. He has given him power to save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>That is what he promised through his holy prophets of God long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He said he would save us from our enemies and set us free from those who hate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>He said he would be kind to our fathers. He said he would remember his agreement with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>That was what he promised our father Abraham he would surely do. He promised to set us free from our enemies. He promised that we should be without fear. He promised that we would worship him and be holy and good before him as long as we live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>You, my child, will be called the prophet or messenger of the Highest One. You will go ahead of the Lord to make his way ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>You will tell his people how to be saved by being forgiven for their wrong ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>Our God is kind. A light from heaven will shine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>That light will shine on those who are in darkness, and are going to die. That light will show us how to walk in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>The child grew. He became strong in spirit. He lived in the desert until the day when he came to the people of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
