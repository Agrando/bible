But test the spirits to see if they belong to God. There are many prophets who are not true who have gone out into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Here is how you can know the Spirit of God. Every spirit that believes that Jesus Christ has come in the body of a man is from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And every spirit that does not say this about Jesus, does not belong to God. That is the spirit of the one who is against Christ. You have heard that he is coming. And now he is already in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My children, you belong to God. You have won the victory over those prophets who are not true. You have won because the Spirit that is in you is stronger than the spirit that is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Those prophets belong to the world. That is why they teach about things in the world.  And that is why the people of the world listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But we belong to God. Anyone who knows God listens to us. Anyone who does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know if a spirit is true or not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My dear brothers, we must love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves others is Gods child and he knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But anyone who does not love others does not know God, because God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This is how God showed his love for us. He sent his only Son into the world to give us life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This is love! We did not love God, but he loved us. And he sent his Son to be the sacrifice to pay for the wrong things we have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My dear brothers, if God loved us so much, we must love one another also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No man has ever seen God. But God lives in us if we love one another. And in loving one another, his love is made perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He has given us of his own Spirit. That is how we know that we are in him and he is in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and we are telling you that the Father sent his Son to save the people in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If anyone says, Jesus is the Son of God, God is in him and he is in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>We know and we believe that God loves us. God is love. And anyone who loves others is in God and God is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That is why we love each other very much. Then we will not be afraid on the day when people are judged. We are like Christ in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Where Gods love is, there is no fear. Gods perfect love takes away fear. It is punishment that makes a person fear. Anyone who has fear does not have perfect love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love others because God first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If anyone says, I love God,and he hates his brother, he is telling a lie. If he does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>God gave us this law. The person who loves God must love his brother also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
