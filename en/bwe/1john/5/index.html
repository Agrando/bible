And everyone who loves the Father loves his child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>This is how we know we love Gods children. We love God and we obey his laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>We show that we love God when we obey his laws. His laws are not hard to obey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone who is Gods child wins a victory over the world. We win because we believe God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who wins a victory over the world? It is only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There was water and there was blood when Jesus Christ came. There was not water only, but there was water and there was blood. The Spirit proves this is true, because the Spirit is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There are three in heaven who prove it is true. They are the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit. These three are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There are three on earth who prove it is true. They are the spirit, the water, and the blood. These three all prove the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We believe what people prove to us. But when God proves something it is stronger than what people prove. This is what God proved about his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Anyone who believes in Gods Son believes what God says about him. Anyone who does not believe God shows that he thinks what God says is not true. He has not believed what God says about his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Here is what God says. He has given us life that will last for ever. And this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So anyone who has the Son has this life. Anyone who does not have the Son of God does not have this life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have written these things to you who believe on the name of the Son of God. I have written them so that you will know that you will live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we are sure God will do this. If we ask him for anything that he wants us to have, he will listen to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know he listens to us when we ask for anything, then we know that we have what we asked him for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Maybe a man sees his brother do something wrong, but not so bad that he must die for it.  The man should ask God and God will let his brother live. God will let people live if the things they have done are not so bad that they must die for them. But there are things so wrong that a person must die for them. If he has done such as that, I do not tell the man to ask God to let him live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Everything that is wrong is a bad thing. But not every bad thing is so wrong that a person must die for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We know that any child of God does not do wrong things. The Son of God keeps him safe and the devil cannot touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we belong to God and the whole world belongs to the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We know that the Son of God has come. He has given us a heart to know him who is true. We belong to him who is true, because we belong to his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God. He has the life that will live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My children, have nothing to do with false gods or idols.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
