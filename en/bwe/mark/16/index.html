Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome came to the grave. They brought spices that smelled very nice to put on the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They came to the grave on the first day of the week. It was very early in the morning.  The sun was beginning to shine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>One woman said to the other, Who will roll away the big stone from the grave for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The stone was very big. When they looked up they saw that the stone was rolled away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they went in the grave. They saw a young man dressed in a white gown. He sat at the right side. They were very much surprised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said, Do not be surprised. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth who was nailed to a cross. He is risen. He is not here. Look, here is where they laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go and tell his disciples and Peter. Tell them he is going to Galilee before you. You will see him there as he said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then they left the grave quickly. They were trembling and afraid. They did not talk to anyone about it because they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus rose early on the first day of the week. He showed himself first to Mary Magdalene. Jesus had driven seven bad spirits out of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told the disciples that she had seen him. They were still crying because Jesus was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Mary told them that he was living. She had seen him. But they would not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this, Jesus came to two disciples. He looked like a different person. They were walking out in the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They went back and told the rest of the disciples, but they would not believe them either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then after that Jesus showed himself to the eleven disciples while they were eating. He said it was very bad for them not to believe and for their minds to be slow. He said they should have believed those who saw him after he rose from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jesus said to them, Go into every part of the world. Tell the good news to everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The one who believes the good news and is baptised will be saved. But he who does not believe will be judged and punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These signs will be with those who believe. They will drive bad spirits out of people by using my name. They will speak new languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They will take up snakes. If they drink poison, it will not make them sick. They will put their hands on sick people and sick people will get well again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So after the Lord Jesus had talked to them, he went up into heaven and sat down beside God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the disciples went and told the good news everywhere. The Lord worked with them. He made their words come true by the signs that happened after they talked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
