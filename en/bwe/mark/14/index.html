The chief priests and the scribes planned how to catch Jesus by some trick. They wanted to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But they said, Let us not do it on the day of the feast. We do not want the people to start fighting about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When Jesus was in the town of Bethany, he was in Simons house. Simon had leprosy.  While Jesus sat at the table, a woman came to him. She had a bottle of oil. It smelled very nice and cost much money. She broke the bottle and poured the oil on Jesus head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Some people there were angry. They said, Why was this oil wasted like that?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The oil might have been sold for a lot of money. Then the money could have been given to poor people. They said to the woman, You should not have done this!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said, Leave the woman alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good thing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You will always have poor people with you. Any time you want to, you can do good to them. But I will not always be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has done what she could. She has put oil on my body to make me ready to be buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I tell you the truth. Any place in the whole world where people tell the good news, people will also tell what she has done. People will remember her because of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests. He told them how he could help them catch Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They were glad when they heard that. They promised to give him money. So he watched for a good way to help them catch Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It was the first day of the feast with bread that has no yeast in it. The sheep had to be killed for the Passover Feast. His disciples asked Jesus Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover Feast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He sent two of his disciples and said to them, Go into the city. There you will meet a man who is carrying a pot of water. Follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When he goes into a house, talk to the master of the house. Say to him, "The Teacher says, Where is my room where I can eat the Passover Feast with my disciples?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man will show you a large room upstairs. It will be all fixed up and ready. Get the Passover food ready for us there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The disciples went to the city. They found everything just as he had said. There they made the Passover food ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the evening he came with the twelve disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While they were sitting at the table eating, Jesus said, I tell you the truth. One of you who is eating with me will give me over to people who hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They were sad and troubled. One after the other began to say to him, Lord, is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered them, It is one of you twelve. It is the one who puts his hand in the same dish with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Son of Man will go just as the holy writings tell about him. But the man who gives him over will have trouble. It would have been better for that man if he had not been born!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As they were eating, Jesus took some bread. He thanked God for it and broke it. Then he gave it to the disciples and said, Take this bread and eat it. It is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He also took a cup. He thanked God for it. Then he gave it to them. They all drank some of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he said to them, This is my blood. It is given for many people. It makes the agreement strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I tell you the truth. I will not drink any of the fruit of the vine again until I drink some of it new in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They sang a song and then went out to the hill called Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus said to them, All of you will leave me this night. the holy writings say, "I will kill the one who takes care of the sheep. And the sheep will run away."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after I am raised from death, I will go to Galilee to meet you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Peter said, Even if all the others leave you, I will never leave you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. This very night, before the cock calls two times, you will say three times that you do not know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Peter said, Even if I must die with you, I will never say I do not know you! They all said the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then they came to a place called Gethsemane. Jesus said to his disciples, Sit here. I will go and talk with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He took Peter, James, and John along with him. Jesus began to be sad and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He said to them, My heart is very sad. I am almost dying! Stay here and watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus went on a little farther. He fell on the ground and asked God that, if it could be so,  this big trouble might pass by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said, Oh, my Father, you can do all things. Take this cup away from me. But do not do what I want, but what you want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus went back and found the disciples sleeping. He said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Could you not watch one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>All of you must watch and talk with God so that you will not do wrong. A persons heart can want to do it, but his body is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus went away again and said the same words to God again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus went back again and found the disciples sleeping. They could not keep their eyes open. They did not know what to say to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then he went back the third time. He said, Are you still sleeping and resting?. It is enough. The time has come now. The Son of Man is given over to bad people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Get up. Let us go. Look, here comes the one who will give me over to people who hate me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>While he was saying this, Judas came. He was one of the twelve disciples. Many people came with him. They had long knives or swords and big sticks. The chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders had sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The man who was going to help them catch Jesus had told them that he would give them a sign. He said, The man that I kiss is the one. Catch him and take him away safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So when he came, he went to Jesus right away. He said, Master! And he kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then they caught Jesus and held him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>One of the men standing by took his sword. He cut off the ear of the high priests servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus said, Have you come to take me with knives and sticks the way you would take a man who steals?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Every day I was with you in the temple and taught. You did not catch me then. But what the holy writings say will come true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then all of the disciples left Jesus and ran away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>A young man went with Jesus. He had a piece of cloth about him. The people caught him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he left the cloth behind and ran away without any clothes on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The people took Jesus away to the high priest. All the chief priests, the leaders, and the scribes met there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Peter followed far behind Jesus. He went into the yard of the high priests house. He sat down with the people who worked for the high priest. He warmed himself by the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>The chief priests, and all the judges of the court tried to find men to say Jesus had done something wrong so they could kill him. But they found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Many people came and said things that were not true. But one said this thing and the other said that thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then some stood up to talk against Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>They said, We heard him say, "I will break down this temple which people have built with hands. In three days I will build another temple but not with hands."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Others said, No, that is not what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>The high priest stood up among the people and asked Jesus, Have you no answer? What do you have to say about this? They have said something against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Jesus said nothing at all. Then the high priest asked him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus answered, Yes, I am. You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the One who has all power. You will see him coming on the clouds of the sky!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, We do not need any more proof against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>What he has said is wrong! What do you think? They all said, He should be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Some people began to spit on him. They covered his face and hit him. They laughed at him and said, Tell us if you know who hit you! The guards took him away and hit him as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Peter sat out in the yard. A servant girl who worked for the high priest came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>She saw Peter warming himself by the fire. She looked at him and said, You were also with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But Peter said, I do not know or understand what you are talking about. Peter went out to the gate. Then a cock called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>A girl saw Peter there and said to the other people standing by, This man is one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But again Peter said he was not. A little while after, those standing around said to Peter,  Surely you are one of them also. You come from Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Then Peter began to curse and say bad words. He said, I do not know this man you are talking about!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>Right then the cock called a second time and Peter remembered that Jesus had said,  Before the cock calls two times, you will say three times that you do not know me.  Then he broke down and cried.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
