Many people came to him. So he got in a boat on the sea and sat down. The people were by the sea on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He told the people stories and taught them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He said, Listen. A man went out to sow some seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As he sowed it, some of the seed fell on the road. Birds came and ate the seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Some seed fell on the stony ground. Not much ground covered the stones. The seed started to grow right away because it was not deep in the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When the sun began to shine, it was too hot for the new plants. They died because they had no roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Some seed fell among the weeds. The weeds grew up and made the new plants die. So no seeds grew on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But some seed fell on good ground. That seed grew and the plants gave more seed. Some plants gave thirty seeds. Some gave sixty. And some gave a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said to them, Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Later, Jesus was alone. Then the twelve disciples and the other people who were there asked him about the stories.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said to them, You can learn the secret things about the kingdom of God. But we must use stories to tell the other people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They may look and look, but they will not see. They may listen and listen, but they will not understand. If they did understand, they would turn back to God and he would forgive them for the wrong things they have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus said also, Do you not understand this story? How then are you going to understand all the stories?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The man who sows the seed tells Gods message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Those beside the road are like people who hear the message. But as soon as they hear it,  Satan comes and takes it out of their hearts</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The seed that fell on the stony ground is the same. It is like people who hear the message and as soon as they hear it they are very glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They believe it for a short time. When trouble or a hard time comes because of the message, they stop believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The seed that fell among the weeds is like people who hear the message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But they think about the things of this world. They want to get money and other things to be happy. These things push the message out of their hearts. No good comes from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But some seed fell on good ground. That is like people who hear the message and understand it. Much good comes from it. Some people are like the seed that made thirty seeds. Some people are like the seed that gave sixty. Some people are like the seed that gave a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus said to them, People do not bring a light and put it under a basket or under a bed. But they put it on the place for a lamp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Everything that is hidden will be seen. Everything that is secret will be known and come out to be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Everyone who has ears to hear, listen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus said, Take care how you listen. How much you give to others is how much will be given to you. You who obey God will get more than you give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Anyone who has some will get more. But he who does not have anything, even the little that he has will be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jesus said, The kingdom of God is like this. A man sows some seed in the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he goes on just as he did before. He sleeps at night and wakes up in the morning.  The seed begins to grow but he doesnt know what makes it grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The ground itself makes the seed grow. First the plant comes up. Then it begins to have seed of its own. After a while the harvest is ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When the harvest is really ready, he cuts it right away because the harvest time has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus said, What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I say it is like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like this. A mustard seed is the smallest seed that is ever planted in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the plant that grows from that seed is bigger than any other plant. It puts out very big branches. The birds come and live in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus told the people many stories like this. He told them as much of Gods words as they were able to understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He did not tell them anything without a story. When he was alone with his disciples, he told them the meaning of the stories.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In the evening of that day, Jesus said to his disciples, Let us cross over to the other side of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The disciples left the people and took Jesus away in the boat he was in. Other little boats were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A very strong wind began to blow. Water came in the boat. It began to fill up with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus was in the back end of the boat, sleeping with his head on a pillow. The disciples woke him up. Master, they shouted. We will die! Do you not care?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Jesus got up. He said to the wind and the sea, Stop! The wind stopped. Then all was quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he said to the disciples, Why do you fear? Do you not believe in God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The disciples were surprised. They said to each other, What kind of man is this? Even the wind and the sea obey him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
