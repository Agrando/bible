He will make the way ready for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A man is calling out in the desert, "Make the way ready for the Lord. Make the road straight for him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>John baptised people in the desert. He told them to stop doing wrong things and be baptised, and God would forgive them for the wrong things they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>People from all the land of Judea and all the city of Jerusalem went out to John. He baptised them in the Jordan River when they told about the wrong things they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>John wore clothes made of camels hair and a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He told the people, Another person is coming. He is greater than I am. I am not good enough to bend down and untie his shoe strings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I have baptised you with water, but he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in the country of Galilee. John baptised him in the Jordan River.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As soon as he came up out of the water, Jesus saw the sky open. He saw Gods Holy Spirit come down on him like a bird called a dove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A voice from the sky said, You are my dear Son. I am very pleased with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Right away, the Spirit made Jesus go into the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus was in the desert for forty days. All that time Satan tried to make Jesus do wrong.  Jesus was with wild animals. Angels came and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>John was put in prison. Then Jesus went to Galilee. He told people the good news of Gods kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The time has come, he said. The kingdom of God is here. Stop your wrong ways, turn back to God and believe the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus was walking by the Sea of Galilee. There he saw Simon and his brother Andrew.  They were throwing a fishing net into the water. Their work was to catch fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to them, Come with me. The work I give you will be to catch people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Right away they left their nets and went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus went on from there and saw James and his brother John. Their fathers name was Zebedee. They were in a boat mending their nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus called them. Right away they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the workmen and went with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They went to the town of Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath day, Jesus went into their meeting house and taught the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They were very much surprised at his teaching because he taught them as if he had the right to teach them. He did not teach them like their teachers called scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man who had a bad spirit in him was in the meeting house at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He called out, Jesus of Nazareth, what do you want to do to us? Have you come to kill us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to the spirit, Be quiet! Come out of him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The bad spirit threw the man around. It called out loud and then it came out of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The people were all surprised. They said one to another, What is this? Is not this a new teaching? He tells the bad spirits what to do and even they obey him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The people all around Galilee heard right away about Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As soon as they came out of the meeting house, they went to the home of Simon and Andrew. James and John went also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Simons wifes mother was sick and was lying down. She had a fever. Right away they told Jesus about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus went to her. He took her hand and helped her up. The fever left her right away,  and she began to do things to help them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That evening when the sun went down, people brought to Jesus all the sick people and those who had bad spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>All the people in the city crowded around the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He healed many sick people. He drove the bad spirits out of people. And he did not let them speak because they knew who he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The next morning Jesus got up long before daylight. He went out to a place by himself.  There he talked with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon and his friends went out after Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When they found him they said, Everyone is looking for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus said, We must go to the next towns. I must tell the good news to the people there too. That is why I came here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Jesus talked to the people in all the meeting houses in all the country of Galilee. He also made the bad spirits come out of people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>A man who was sick with leprosy <FI>a bad skin disease<Fi> came to him. He kneeled down and begged Jesus saying, I know you can heal me if you want to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus was very sorry for him. He put out his hand and touched him. He said, I want to.  Be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>As soon as he said this, the disease left the man and he was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus talked strongly to him and sent him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He said, Do not tell anyone about this. But go and let the priest look at you. Moses gave a law about the gift you must give to God when you are healed. Give it to prove to people that you are healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But the man went out and told everyone everywhere what had happened to him. Because he did this, Jesus could not go into any large town freely. He stayed in places where only a few people were. There people came to him from everywhere.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
