Many people came to him there again. He taught them as he always did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The Pharisees came to him and asked, Is it right for a man to send his wife away from him? They asked this to test Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jesus answered, What law did Moses give you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They said, Moses allowed a man to write a paper to show that he does not want her any more. Then he may send her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus said to them, Moses wrote that law because your hearts are so hard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the time God first made people, he made them man and woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That is why a man must leave his father and mother and stay with his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The two of them will be like one person. So they are not two people any more, but they are one person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Man must not separate what God has joined together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they were in the house, the disciples asked Jesus about this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Jesus said, If any man sends away his wife and marries another woman, he commits adultery against her. <FI>He takes another woman who is not his wife.<Fi></span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If a woman sends away her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought children to Jesus. They wanted him to put his hands on them. The disciples tried to stop the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When Jesus saw what the disciples did, he did not like it. He said, Let the children come to me. Do not try to stop them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I tell you the truth. If anyone does not believe in the kingdom of God like a child, he will never go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus took the children up in his arms. He put his hands on them and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus started on the way again. A man came running and kneeled down before him. He said, Good Teacher, what must I do so that I will live for ever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Jesus said, Why do you call me good? Only God is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know the laws: "Do not commit adultery. Do not kill. Do not steal. Do not tell lies.  Do not cheat. Respect your father and your mother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The man answered Jesus. He said, Teacher, I have kept all those laws since I was a boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus looked at him. He loved him. He said, You need one thing more. Go home. Sell everything you have. Give the money to the poor people. You will be rich in heaven. So be ready to carry your own cross and come with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the young man heard that, he was sad, because he was very rich. So he went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Jesus looked around at his disciples and said to them, It is very hard for rich people to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The disciples were surprised at his words. But Jesus said again, Children, it is very hard for people who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a big animal to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They were very much surprised. They said, Then who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus looked at them and said, Men cannot do it but God can, because God can do anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter began to speak and said to him, See, we have left all things and have come with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>, fehlt/missing</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus said, I tell you the truth. If any man has left his house, or his brothers, or his sisters, his mother, or his father, or his children, or farms, for my sake and for the sake of the good news, he will receive his pay in this life. He will have a hundred times as many houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and farms. He will have trouble also. But in the next world he will live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many people who are first will be last, and those who are last will be first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus and his disciples were on the road to Jerusalem. Jesus was walking in front of them.  The disciples were surprised. And the people who came behind were afraid. He took the twelve disciples and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He said, We are going to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be given over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will judge him and say he must die. They will give him over to rulers who are not Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They will make fun of him. They will spit on him. They will beat him and kill him. After three days, he will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said, Master, we want you to do for us anything we ask you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus said, What do you want me to do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said, Let one of us sit at your right side and one at your left side when you rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said, You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink from the cup that I will drink from? Can you go through the big trouble that I will go through?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Yes, they said. We can. Then Jesus said to them, You will drink what I drink and you will have trouble the way I will have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But I cannot choose who will sit at my right hand or at my left. It has been planned who will sit there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>When the other ten disciples heard about it, they were angry with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus called them and said, You know the people who rule over countries make their people obey them. The great will tell the others what to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But that is not the way it is among you. Anyone among you who wants to be great must help the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Anyone among you who wants to be first shall be a servant to the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The Son of Man did not come to have others help him. But he came to help others. He came to give his life to make many people free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples left Jericho, many people followed him. A blind man named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the road. He was begging for money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He heard that Jesus of Nazareth was passing. So he shouted, Jesus, Son of David! Help me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Many people said, Be quiet! But he shouted louder, Son of David! Help me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus stopped and said, Call him. They called the blind man and said to him, Be glad!  Come, get up! He is calling you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>The man threw off his coat, jumped up, and went to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jesus said, What do you want me to do for you? The blind man said to him, Teacher, I want to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Jesus said, Go home. Because you believe in me, your faith has made you well. Right then he was able to see. He followed Jesus on the road.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
