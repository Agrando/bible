He says, "I know what you do. People say that you are alive, but you are dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Wake up! You still have a little life left in you. Make it stronger before it dies altogether. I have not seen you do anything that looked right to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So remember the things you were told and the things you have heard. Obey them. Stop the things you have been doing. If you do not wake up, I will come to you like a thief.  You will not know when I will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But you have a few people in Sardis who have not made their clothes dirty. They will walk with me in white clothes, because they are good enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He who wins will wear white clothes. I will not take his name out of the book of life. I will tell his name to my Father and to his angels."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Write this to the angel of the church people in Philadelphia: Here are the words of the one who is holy and true. He has Davids key. No one will shut what he opens. And no one will open what he shuts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He says, "I know what you do. Look, I have opened a door in front of you. No one can shut it. I know that you do not have much power. But you have obeyed my word and you have never said you did not believe in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Look! I will bring some people who belong to Satans group. They call themselves Jews,  but they are not real Jews. They lie. Look, I will make them come and kneel down in front of you. They will know that I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have obeyed my word and been patient. So I will keep you safe in the time of trouble which will come all over the world. It will test the people who live on earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am coming again soon! Hold on to the faith which you have, so that no one will stop you receiving your reward in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will make the person who wins become a strong post in the temple of my God. I will keep him strong. He will never leave it again. I will write on him the name of my God and the name of my Gods city. This city is the new Jerusalem. It comes down out of heaven from my God. And I will write my new name on him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Write this to the angel of the church people in Laodicea: Here are the words of the one whose name is Truth. What he says can be trusted. He is the one who began all that God made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He says, "I know what you do. I know that you are neither cold nor hot. And I wish that you were cold or hot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So I will spit you out of my mouth, because you are only warm and not hot or cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You say, I am rich and have many things. I need nothing. You do not know that you are in trouble and need help. You are poor. You are blind. And you have no clothes to wear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I tell you what you should do. You should buy from me gold that has been made clean by fire. Then you will be rich. And you should buy from me white clothes to wear. Then people will not see that you have no clothes, and you will not be ashamed. You should buy from me healing oil to put on your eyes. Then you will be able to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I tell off and punish the people I love. So get busy and stop doing wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Listen, I stand at the door and knock. If any one hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him. I will eat with him, and he will eat with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who wins will sit with me on my throne in heaven. I won too, and I sat down with my Father on his throne."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He who can hear should listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
