It had writing on the front and the back. It was locked with seven locks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I saw a strong angel calling with a loud voice. He said, Who can open the book and break its locks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the book or look in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I cried very much because no one could open the book or look in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then one of the leaders said to me, Do not cry. See, the Lion of the tribe of Judah has won! The One who was born into Davids family has won! He can open the book and break its seven locks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I saw a Lamb standing in front of the throne and the four living beings, and in front of the leaders. It looked as if it had been killed. It had seven horns and seven eyes. They are the seven Spirits of God who are sent out all over the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He went and took the book from the right hand of the One who sat on the throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he took the book, the four living beings and the twenty-four leaders kneeled down in front of the Lamb. Every one of them had a harp and a gold bowl. The bowls were full of incense that smelled very sweet when it was burned. These bowls are the words of Gods people when they talk to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the four living beings and the leaders sang a new song. The new song was: You are able to take the book and to open its locks, because you were killed. You have set the people free and bought them for God with the cost of your blood. They are from every tribe, language, nation, and country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have made them into kings and priests for our God. They will rule on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw and heard many angels. They were around the chair, and the living beings,  and the leaders. There were many, many thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They said with a loud voice, The Lamb of God who was killed is the only one good enough to be given power, riches, wisdom, strength, honour, praise, and blessing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I heard everything in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea, and everything in them say, Blessing, honour, praise, and power belong for ever and ever to the One who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the four living beings said, Amen! May it be so! And the leaders kneeled down and worshipped the One who lives for ever and ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
