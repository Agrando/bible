It sounded like many people calling. They said,  Praise our God! He saves people. He is great and power belongs to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The way God punishes is true and right. He has punished the bad woman who spoiled the earth with her wrong ways. He has made her pay for the killing of his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They said again, Praise God! The smoke where she burns goes up for ever and ever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the twenty-four leaders and the four living beings kneeled down. They worshipped God who was sitting on his throne, and they said, Amen! Yes, it is so! Praise God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A voice from the throne said, Praise our God, all his servants, all who respect and honour him: you who are great and you who are not great, praise him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I heard a sound in heaven. It sounded like many people and much water flowing and like loud thunder. They said, Praise God! The Lord our God, who has all power,  rules!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>We will be glad and very happy! We will praise him. The time has come for the Lamb to marry. The woman who will marry him is ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She was given the right to wear fine linen, shining and clean. The fine linen means the good things Gods people have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The angel said to me, Write this: God blesses those who are called to come to the wedding feast of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the true words of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then I kneeled down in front of him to worship him. But he said to me, You must not do that! I am only a servant like you and like your brothers who tell about Jesus. Worship God! Those who tell about Jesus have the spirit of a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I saw heaven open, and I saw a white horse! The One who rode him is called One who can be Trusted and The True One.He punishes and makes war in the right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes were like a flame of fire. On his head were many crowns. He had a name written on him, but no man knew what it was but he himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He wore clothes that had been dipped in blood. His name is The Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The armies of heaven followed him on white horses and they were dressed in fine linen,  shining and clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>A long knife or sword comes from his mouth. With it he will punish and control the people of the nations. He will rule them with an iron stick. He is like the winepress that presses the water out of the fruit. It is the place where God, who has all power, shows his great anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A name is written on his clothes and on his leg: it is King of kings, and Lord of lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I saw an angel standing in the sun. He called in a loud voice to all the birds that fly across the sky. He said, Come, gather for Gods big feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come to eat the bodies of kings, the bodies of captains, the bodies of strong men, the bodies of horses and those who ride them, the bodies of all free men and of slaves, those who are great and those who are not great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies. They were gathered to fight against the One riding the horse and his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the beast was caught and the prophet who is not true was caught. The prophet had done big works for the beast to see. By the things which he did, he had fooled the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshipped its idol. The beast and the prophet were thrown alive into the big fire which burns with dust that chokes people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Their armies were killed by the man riding the horse. He killed them with the sword that came out of his mouth. All the birds ate all they wanted of their dead bodies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
