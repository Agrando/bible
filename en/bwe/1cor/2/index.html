That one thing was Jesus Christ and his death on a cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I was weak, afraid, and trembling when I visited you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My words and my message were not in wise words to win you. But the power of the Spirit of God proved my words to be true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I did this so that you would not believe because of mans wise words, but you would believe because of Gods power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>However, our words are wise words to those who really believe. But they are not the kind of wise words that the people of this world speak. They are not the kind of wise words that the rulers of this world speak. Those rulers will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our wise words are Gods wise words about things people do not understand. Before God made the world he planned those things for our glory and blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>None of the rulers of this world knew about these things. If they had, they would not have killed on a cross the Lord who was full of Gods glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The holy writings say, No eye has seen the things God has made ready for those who love him. No ear has heard about them. No persons heart has ever thought of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>God has shown these things to us by his Spirit. The Spirit understands everything, even the things that God has kept secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The only one who really knows what a person is thinking is the spirit of the person himself. So also, no one knows what God is thinking, only the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We have not received the spirit of the world. But we have received the Spirit of God. In this way we may understand the blessings which God has freely given to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>We do not tell you these things in wise words which men taught us. But the Holy Spirit taught us. We teach things about the Spirit which we know about through the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The person who does not have the Spirit does not receive the blessings of the Spirit of God. He thinks they are foolish. He cannot understand them because only people who have the Spirit of God can test them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who has the Spirit of God tests all things. But others cannot test him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The holy writings say: Who knows the mind of the Lord so that he may teach him? As for us, we really do have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
