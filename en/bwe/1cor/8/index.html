We all know something about this matter. Yet knowledge makes us proud. Love is the real teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If anyone thinks he knows much, then he does not know what he really should know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But if anyone loves God, then God knows him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So here is what I say about eating food that has been given to idols or false gods. We know that an idol really is nothing in this world. There is only one true and living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There are things in the sky and on earth which are called gods. Yes, there are many gods and lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet for us there is only one God. He is the Father. All things come from him. He is the one for whom we live. And there is only one Lord. He is Jesus Christ. He made all things.  He is the one who gives us life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But not every Christian knows these things. Some of them have always believed in idols.  And when they eat food which has been given to an idol, they think the food belongs to the idol. And because they are weak Christians they feel they do wrong when they eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>One thing is sure, food will not bring us closer to God. If we eat it, it will not make us right with God. And if we do not eat, it will not make us wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Perhaps you feel it is all right for you to do it. But be careful! It might make the weak Christian do wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You know it is not wrong for you to eat these things. But if a weak Christian sees you eating in the idols house, he will also want to eat food that has been given to an idol. He will do what is against his own belief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You know the truth, and yet your knowledge will make your weak brother do wrong.  You have hurt the faith of a brother, for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In this way you do wrong to your brother. You hurt him because he is weak. And in so doing you do wrong to Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If eating such food makes my brother do wrong, I will never eat it. I do not want my brother to do wrong.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
