But you should also want other things the Spirit gives. You should want very much to be able to speak words from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The person who talks in tongues of a different language does not talk to people, but to God. People do not understand what he says. But he is saying secret things by the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the person who is a prophet speaks words from God to people plainly. He helps them to believe and to be strong, and he comforts them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The person who talks in a different tongue helps himself. But the one who tells forth Gods word helps all the people in the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I wish that you could all talk in different tongues. But I want even more that you should speak words from God for all to hear and understand. The person who speaks words from God is greater than the person who talks in tongues-unless he is able to tell the meaning of his words, so that he helps all the people in the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My brothers, if I come to you and talk in tongues of a different language, how can I help you? I cannot help you if I do not tell you something God has shown to me, or something I know, or Gods word, or some teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Such things as horns or harps have no life, but they make sounds. Now if they dont make the right noise, no one will know what the sound means.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the war drum gives a sound that has no meaning, then no one will get ready to fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If you say words that people cannot understand, they will not know what you say. You talk for nothing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are no doubt many different languages in the world. And every one of them has a meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if a person talks in a language and I do not know the meaning of it, I will be like a stranger to him and he will be like a stranger to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So it is with you. You want the gifts of the Spirit. Then you should want the gift which will make you better able to help the church people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So then, the person who talks in a tongue of a different language, should ask God to help tell the meaning of the tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I pray to God in a tongue of a different language, then I am talking with my spirit, but I do not use my mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What then shall I do? I will talk to God with my spirit and I will talk to God with my mind.  I will sing with my spirit and I will sing with my mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If you thank God with your spirit only, an ordinary person cannot say, Amen, it is so!  He does not know what you say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The way you thank God is good, but it does not help an ordinary person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank God that I can talk in tongues more than any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But in the church meeting it is better for me to say five words with my mind, so that I will teach other people also. This is better than to say ten thousand words in a tongue of a different language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My brothers, do not be like children in your thinking. When it comes to doing wrong things, be like small babies. But in your thinking be grown up people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The holy writings say, I will talk to these people by strangers and by people who talk in strange tongues. And yet, they will not listen to me. This is what the Lord says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So then, tongues are a sign to people who do not believe God. They are not a sign to those who believe him. But speaking words from God like a prophet is a sign to those who believe. It is not a sign to those who do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sometimes all the people of the church may be gathered together. If everyone talks in tongues, and if some people who do not know or believe come in, they will say that you are crazy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But what happens if everyone speaks words from God? If such people come in, then the words from God will prove to them that they have done wrong. They will all speak to the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Such a person sees everything that has been hidden in his heart. Then he will kneel down and worship God. He will say, It is true. God is here among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What shall we do about it, my brothers? When you meet together, every one of you has something to help the other. One has a song to sing. One has something to teach people.  One has something which God has shown to him. One has something to say in a tongue.  One can tell the meaning of a tongue. Do all of these things to help one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any people talk in a tongue, only two or not more than three should talk. They must talk one at a time and someone must tell the meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no one to tell the meaning, a person must not talk in a tongue of a different language in the church meeting. He should talk to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Two or three prophets may speak words from God and the others should say what they think about it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if another person is sitting by and God gives him something to say, then the first person should stop talking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>One by one you may speak words from God. In that way, all will learn something and all will be stronger in faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Those who speak words from God are able to keep their own spirits quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God does not want things to be out of order. He wants peace in the church meeting. In all the churches of Gods people, the women should be quiet in the church meetings. They must not be allowed to talk. They must obey. The holy writings say this also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If the women want to know something, they should ask their own husbands at home. It is a shame for a woman to talk in a church meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you think that you were the first ones to tell the word of God? Or do you think that you are the only people who have it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Perhaps someone thinks, I am the one to speak words from God, or, I have the Spirit.  Then know this, the Lord has told me to write these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If anyone does not know this, then God will not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So, my brothers, the thing you should want is to speak words from God. But at the same time, do not stop anyone from talking in tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But everything should be done in the right way and in good order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
