But I talked to you as people who have the spirit of this world. I talked to you as people who are very new-born, baby Christians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I gave you milk to drink, not food to eat. You were not ready for food. And even now you are not ready for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You still have the spirit of this world in you. You are jealous of each other and you are quarrelling. The spirit of this world is still in you and you live like people of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>One says, I belong to Paul. Another says, I belong to Apollos. Does not that show that you have the spirit of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>After all, who is Apollos? And who is Paul? We both work for God. You believed because of the work we did. The Lord gave each of us our work to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted the seed. Apollos put water on the seed. But God made the seed grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then the man who plants is nothing and the man who waters is nothing. God alone makes the seed grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The man who plants and the man who waters are equal. Each one will be paid for his own work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We work together for God. You are Gods farm. You are Gods house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I built the lower walls of the house because God showed me the best way to do it. Now another man builds on top of this foundation. Each man must take care how he builds on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus Christ himself is the foundation. No one can make another one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>People build with gold, silver, very fine stones, wood, grass, or straw on top of the foundation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the day will come when everyones work can be seen. Their work will be tested by fire and the fire will show what kind of work each one did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If the work a man did is not burned up in the fire, he will be paid for his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if a mans work is burned up, he will lose everything. He himself will be saved, like a man pulled out of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You know that you are Gods house. The spirit of God lives in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>God will punish anyone who spoils his house. His house is holy, and you are the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not be fooled. If any one of you thinks that he is wise in the things of this world, he should count himself as not being wise. Then he would really be wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The things that look wise to the people of this world look foolish to God. The holy writings say, He catches the wise people in their own tricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It also says, The Lord knows that the wise mens thoughts are good for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So do not be proud of men. Everything belongs to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Paul, Apollos, Peter, the world, life, death, the things which are now, and the things which are to come, everything is yours!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you belong to Christ and Christ belongs to God!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
