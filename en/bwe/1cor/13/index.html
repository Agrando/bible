Love is not jealous. Love is not proud and does not boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Love does not do things that are not nice. Love does not just think of itself. Love does not get angry. Love holds no wrong feelings in the heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Love is not glad when people do wrong things. But it is always glad when they do right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Love forgives everything. Love is always trusting, and always hoping, and never gives up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Love never ends. The gift of speaking words from God will end. The gift of speaking in different tongues or languages will stop. The gift of knowing many things will end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now we know only a little, and we can speak only a little of Gods words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when everything becomes perfect, that part will come to an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When I was a child, I talked like a child. I understood like a child. I thought like a child.  But when I became a man, I stopped doing things like a child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now it is like looking in a looking-glass which does not make things clear. We cannot see and understand things plainly. But when things become perfect, then we shall fully know and understand everything, just as God knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These three things will remain for ever. They are faith, hope, and love. And love is the greatest of them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
