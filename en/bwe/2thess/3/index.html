Ask God that the Lords message may reach many people quickly and that they may receive it gladly as you did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ask God that we may be saved from bad people who do wrong things. Not everyone believes in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the Lord can be trusted. He will make you strong. He will keep you safe from all that is wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Lord makes us feel sure about you. We are sure that you are doing, and will do,  what we tell you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>May the Lord lead you to love God and be patient like Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, my brothers, we tell you to do this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Have nothing to do with any lazy brother who is not living the way we taught you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You yourselves know how you should be like us. We were not lazy when we were with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We did not eat anyones food without paying for it. But we worked very hard day and night because we did not want to trouble any one of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We have the right to be helped. But we wanted to show you what you should do in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even when we were with you, we told you this, If any man will not work, do not let him eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We hear that some of you are lazy. You do not work, but you trouble other people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>We say to such lazy people, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Do your work quietly.  Earn your own food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My brothers, do not get tired of doing what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any one will not obey what we say in this letter, look at that man and remember him.  Have nothing to do with him, so that he will be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do not treat him like an enemy. Tell him, as you would tell a brother, what he should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Lord gives peace. May he give his peace to you at all times in every way. May the Lord be with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I, Paul, write these words of greeting with my own hand. This is the sign in all my letters that I wrote them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The loving kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
