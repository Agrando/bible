It will all happen very quickly. And there will be no way out. It will be like the pain that a woman has when a child is born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But you, my brothers, are not in the dark. That day should not surprise you like a person who comes to steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You all belong to the light. You belong to the day. We do not belong to the night or to the dark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So then, we must not go to sleep like other people. No, we must keep watching and not get drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because we belong to the day, we must not get drunk. But we must be ready like people dressed for war.
