Tell them to be ready to do any honest work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They must not say wrong things about anyone. They must not quarrel. They must be kind and polite to everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There was a time when we ourselves did not have understanding. We did not obey God.  We were fooled by people. We did many wrong things we wanted to do. We did what we pleased. We lived our days in planning to do wrong things and wanting what other people had. People hated us, and we hated each other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>God who saves us showed how kind and good he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>We were not saved by any good things we did ourselves, but he saved us because he is so kind. He washed us clean. We were born again as a new person. The Holy Spirit has made us new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>God is rich. And he gave the Holy Spirit to us because of Jesus Christ our Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He did this so that we can be put right with God, by his kindness. He did this so that we can become his children. So now we can look forward to everlasting life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>These are true words. And I want you to tell the people these things. Then those who have believed God will try to do good things. These things are right and help people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have nothing to do with: foolish quarrels; lists of people who lived long ago; those who make trouble and argue about the law. These things do not help people and are good for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Talk to any who do not believe right. Talk to them about it once or twice. Then, if they will not listen, have nothing more to do with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You know that such people are wrong and what they do is wrong. They themselves know that they are wrong. Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at the city of Nicopolis. I have planned to stay there while it is the cold time of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Do your best to send Zenas the lawyer, and Apollos on their way. Give them all they need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Our people should learn to spend their time in doing good things to help people who are poor. In that way, our people will not waste their time. Greet those who believe as we do and who love us. God bless you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>missing fehlt/missing</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
