So then,  like people running a race, we must take off everything that is heavy. We must put off all wrong, wrong things that get in our way. We must not stop running until we reach the mark that has been put in front of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>We must keep our eyes on Jesus. He believed from first to last. What was put in front of him made him glad, so he did not give up when the people nailed him on a cross. He did not care about the shame. And now he is sitting beside God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Think about him. He did not give up when bad people said wrong things about him.  When you think about him, you will not become tired and your hearts will not give up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You have been fighting against bad people. But you have not been hurt very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You have forgotten the words spoken to you as sons. My son, when the Lord punishes you, do not think it is a little thing. Do not give up when he tells you that you do wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Lord punishes the person he loves. And he beats every son he takes into his family.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not give up when you are punished. God is treating you like sons. Is there a son who has never been punished by his father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You are punished like the other children in the family. If you are not, you do not belong to the family as the other children do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And what is more, our fathers on earth punished us and we respected them. We should obey even more the Father of our spirits. If we do, we will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Our fathers on earth punished us for a short time the way they wanted to. But God punishes us the way it is good for us. He is holy and good, so he wants us to become holy also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>At the time a person is punished, he is not glad. He is sad. But after it is over, there is peace. Then those who are trained by it do what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So lift up your hands that are hanging down. Make your weak knees strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Walk straight ahead. Then weak feet will not get worse, but will be made well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Try to be at peace with all people. And try to be holy. If a person is not holy, he will not see the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Take care that no one loses Gods blessing. Take care so that no angry feeling starts to grow in anyone. It will make trouble and many people will become bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Take care that no one takes part in wrong ways of using sex. And take care that no one is like Esau and forgets God. He was the older son. But he sold all that he would get from his father. He sold it for a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You know that later he wanted to get the blessing, but he did not get it. He could not turn back. He even cried as he begged for the blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You have not come to the mountain that can be touched and is burning with a big fire.  You have not come to the place of darkness and night and storm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You have not come to a place where a loud trumpet or horn is blown, and a loud voice is talking. When the people heard the voice, they begged that God would not say anything more to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They were afraid of what he said. He said, If even an animal touches this mountain, it must be killed with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moses was afraid when he saw all this. He said, I fear very much and I tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have come to a hill called Zion. You have come to the city of the living God. It is the Jerusalem in heaven. You have come to many thousands of angels in a happy gathering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You have come to the church people. They are Gods first sons, and their names are written in heaven. You have come to God who is the judge of all people. You have come to the spirits of good people who have been made right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You have come to Jesus who is the middle man of a new agreement. You have come to the place where the spilling of his blood has more power than Abels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Take care that you listen to God who is talking now. The people were punished when they would not listen to the One who talked on earth. And we will be punished much worse if we will not listen to the One who talks from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>That time his voice shook the earth. But now he has said, Only once more I will shake the earth and the sky also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The words, Only once more mean that the things that are shaken will be taken away.  They are things that were made. The things which are not shaken will stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We have a place in heaven that cannot be shaken. So let us be glad and worship God and please him. Let us respect and fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Our God is a fire that can burn up.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
