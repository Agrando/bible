It cannot show the good things themselves. People come to worship God. But the law can never make them all right by the same sacrifices that are brought every year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If the law could make people all right, they would stop making sacrifices. The people who come to worship would be made clean for all time, and they would not remember the wrong things they had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But, by making these sacrifices, they show that they do remember the wrong things they have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The blood of bulls and goats can never clean wrong things from peoples hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That is why Christ said when he came into the world, You did not want sacrifices and gifts. But you made a body for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Animals that are burned for sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away the wrong things that people do, did not satisfy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, "See, I have come to do what you, God, want me to do." This is what is written about me in the book of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>First he said, You did not want sacrifices and gifts, and animals that are given to be burned as sacrifices, and animals killed to clean away peoples wrong ways. You did not like them. These sacrifices are made to obey the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he said, See, I have come to do what you want me to do. He took away the first kind of sacrifices so that the second kind would remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>God wanted us to be made holy. We have been made holy by Jesus Christ. He made us holy by once making his body a sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Every priest stands day after day doing his work. He makes the same sacrifices many times. But these sacrifices can never clean away the wrong things people have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Christ made one sacrifice to clean away their wrong ways for ever. Then he sat down beside God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Since then, he is waiting till his enemies are put under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>By one sacrifice Christ has made right for ever all those people who are being made holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Holy Spirit tells us about this also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>First he said, This is the agreement that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts. I will write them in their minds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he also said, I will never remember the wrong things they have done and the times they did not obey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When these wrong things have been forgiven, a sacrifice is not needed for them again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So, my brothers, we can go into the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He made a new and living way for us. He opened up Gods way specially for us. It lets us through the big curtain or cloth which hides God from us. This happened when Jesus gave his body as a sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also, we have a high priest who has charge of Gods people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So let us come to him with a true heart. Let us come because we believe all these things.  Let us come with our hearts washed clean from our wrong ways. Let us come with our bodies washed with clean water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>We must hold on to Gods promise that we have said we believed. And we must never let go. He has promised and he will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let us think of one another and help one another to love and to do good things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Do not stop going to church meetings. Some people do stop. But help each other to be strong. You must do it all the more as you see the Great Day coming closer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Do we go on doing what is wrong after we know the truth? If we do, then there is no sacrifice any more for the wrong things we do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But we will be judged, and that makes us fear. Gods anger will be like a very hot fire that will burn up those who are against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Any man who broke the law of Moses was killed, if two or three people proved that he had broken the law. He will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the person who should have much bigger punishment is the one who turns against the Son of God. That person was made holy by the blood of the new agreement and then calls it nothing. He no longer honours and respects the Spirit who has been so kind to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We know God who has said, I am the one who will punish people. I will repay them.  Also, The Lord will judge his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>People should fear very much to be punished by the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember the first days when you had the light of Gods truth. In those days you were strong, even though you had to fight against many troubles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sometimes it was because people said and did wrong things to you and everybody saw it.  And sometimes it was because you stood with others who had wrong things done to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You shared in the troubles of those who were in prison. When your things were taken from you, you were happy. You knew that you had better things in heaven, things that would always belong to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So do not stop believing God now. Your faith will bring you much reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You must not give up believing. Then you will do what God wants you to do. Then you will get what he promised you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The holy writings say In a little while, the one who is to come will come. He will not wait any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If a person does what is right because he believes in God, he will live. If he turns back, I will not be pleased with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>We are not the people who turn back and so are lost. But we are people who believe, and so we are saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
