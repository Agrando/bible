We now have a high priest who sits beside Gods throne or chief chair in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He is priest in the true holy place where God lives. The Lord made that place, man did not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Every high priest is chosen to offer gifts and sacrifices. So this high priest must have something to offer also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If he were still on earth, he would not be a priest. There are priests on earth already who offer gifts the way the law says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The work they do shows what the work of the priest in heaven is. When Moses made a house for God, here is what God told him to do. He said, Be sure you make everything like I showed you on the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Christ has been given a much better work, because he is the man who is between God and men in making an agreement. This is a much better agreement. It was made by better promises.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If the first agreement had been all right, there would have been no need to make another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the people had done wrong, Gods words to them were, The days will come, the Lord says, when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It will not be like the agreement that I made with their fathers. I made that agreement the day I led them by the hand out of the country of Egypt. But they did not keep their part of my agreement, so I left them alone, the Lord says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>After those days, the Lord says, I will make an agreement with the people of Israel. This is my agreement. I will put my laws in their minds. I will write them in their hearts. I will be their God and they will be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A man will not need to teach another man, or his brother. He will not say, "Know the Lord," because everyone from the youngest to the oldest will know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will be kind even when they do what is not right, and I will never remember the wrong things they do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>God says this is a new agreement, and that makes the first one old. When a thing is old and no good, it is about ready to be thrown away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
