You are also called to go to heaven. Take time to think carefully about Jesus. God sent him. He is the high priest we believe in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He did what God sent him to do, just as Moses did in Gods house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Jesus is much greater than Moses-as the one who builds a house is greater than the house itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Every house is built by someone, but God is the one who builds all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moses did what he was told to do as a servant in all of Gods house. He showed things that God would say later.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus Christ was true as a Son over Gods house. We are Gods house if we keep on believing and telling others what we hope to have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So as the Holy Spirit says, Today, when you hear me speak, do not make your hearts hard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is what happened when the people tested me in the desert and I became angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There your fathers tested me and tried me. And they saw what I did for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I was very angry with the people of that time. I said, "Their minds are always dark.  They have not known my ways."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I said when I was angry, "They will never go into my resting place."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My brothers, take care that not one of you has a heart that does not believe. Such a heart will take you away from the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But talk to each other every day while Today lasts, so that wrong ways will not fool any one of you and your hearts become hard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We have our part with Christ if we go on to the end and believe in him as we did at first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>God is still saying now, Today, when you hear me speak, do not make your hearts hard.  That is what happened when the people turned against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were the people who heard him and yet made him very angry? It was all the people whom Moses led out of the country of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>With whom was God angry for forty years? He was angry with the people who had done wrong. And they died in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who were the people God said would never go into his resting place? They were the people who would not listen to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then, we see that they could not go in because they did not believe him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
