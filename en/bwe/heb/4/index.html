So let us take care that not one of you will be kept out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The good news has been told to us just as it was told to the people in the desert. But the message which they heard did not do them any good. Even though they heard it, they did not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But we who believe, will go into that resting place of God. It is as God said, When I was angry, I said, "They will never go into my resting place." He said this even though his work had been finished ever since he had made the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Here is what he said, somewhere in the holy writings, about the seventh day: And God rested on the seventh day after doing all his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now here he says again, They will never go into my resting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So that means some people will go in. But the people who first heard the good news about it did not go in. They did not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So he chose another day called Today. He spoke through David many years later, who said, Today, when you hear his voice, do not make your hearts hard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If Joshua had led those people to rest, God would not have talked later about another day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So there is still a rest for Gods people, like a Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The person who goes into Gods resting place will rest after doing his work, just as God rested after doing his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So let us do our best to go into that resting place. Those people died in the wilderness because they did not believe. So let us take care that the same thing does not happen to one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Gods word is living and full of power. It is more sharp than any sword that cuts on both sides. What God says cuts through and divides the mind and spirit. It cuts through and divides the place where the bones are joined, and the part inside the bone. What God says is able to judge the things people think and plan in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>God is the one we must meet. Nothing can be hidden from him. Everything is open and he can see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We have a great high priest who has gone into heaven. He is Jesus, the Son of God.  Because we have such a great high priest, let us hold on to the things we believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We have a high priest who can feel with us when we are weak. He has been tested in every way, just as we are. But he did not do anything wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So let us trust him when we come to worship God. He is so good. He will be kind to us and help us when we need it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
