I am an apostle of Christ Jesus because God wanted me to be. This is because God has promised life through Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Timothy, you are my son and I love you very much. May God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord, bless you. May they be kind to you and give you peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I worship God with a clean heart, as my fathers did. And I thank God when I talk to him about you. I always do this night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I want very much to see you. I remember how you cried when we left you. When I see you, how happy I shall be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I remember that you really believe. Your grandmother Lois believed first. Your mother Eunice believed too. I am sure that you believe in the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That is why I am telling you again. You must use Gods gift. It was given to you when I put my hands on your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>God has not given us a spirit of fear. But he has given us a spirit of power and love and self-control.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So do not be ashamed to talk about our Lord. And do not be ashamed of me. I am his prisoner. Be patient in your trouble also, because you tell the good news. God will give you the power to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God saved us and called us to live a holy life. He did not do it because of the good things we have done. He did it because he himself planned to do it, and wanted to do it. That was the blessing he gave us in Christ Jesus. He had this plan before he made the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But now he has made it real through the coming of Jesus Christ who saves. He has put death out of the way. He has shown people can have everlasting life by telling them the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have been chosen to tell that good news. I have been chosen to go out and teach it to those who are not Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>That is why I have this trouble. But I am not ashamed of it because I know the one whom I have trusted. And I am sure he is able to keep safe what I have trusted to him. He will keep it safe until that great day when he comes again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Take what I have taught you as a guide for good teaching. Keep believing in Christ Jesus and loving him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Keep safe that good thing which was trusted to you. The Holy Spirit who lives in us will help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You know that all the men who live in the country of Asia Minor have left me. Phygellus and Hermogenes are among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I hope the Lord will be kind to the family of Onesiphorus. He has often helped me. He has not been ashamed of me in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When he came to the city of Rome, he looked for me until he found me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I hope the Lord will be kind to him on that great day. You know very well all that he did for me in the city of Ephesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
