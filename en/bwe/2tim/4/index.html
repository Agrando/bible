I say this to you because he will come back and rule over all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Tell people the word of God. Be ready to do it at any time. Show people they are wrong and talk to them about it. Tell them what they should do. Be very patient with them and teach them in many ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The time is coming when people will not listen to good teaching. They will want to listen to the things they like to hear. And they will bring in many teachers who will teach them just what they want to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They will not listen to what is true, but will turn away and listen to strange stories.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you, Timothy, must always be watching. Be patient in your troubles. Tell the good news. Do all the work God has given you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My life is already being poured out as an offering to God. The time is here for me to leave this life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have fought the kind of fight that is good. I have reached the mark on the road that God wanted me to reach. And I have kept on believing in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>From now on, my reward is waiting for me, because I have done what is right. The Lord will repay me on the day when he comes back. He judges the right way. I will not be the only one to get a reward from him. But he will repay all those who want very much to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Try to come to me soon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Demas has left me because he loved the things of this world. He has gone to the city of Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you. He helps me very much in my work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I left a coat with Carpus in Troas. Bring it with you when you come, and also bring the books. But most of all, I want the written papers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Alexander, the man who makes things from copper, did many wrong things to me. The Lord will punish him for what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You too must keep away from him, for he was very much against what we said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The first time I spoke for myself in court, no one was on my side. All left me. I hope that God will forgive them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the Lord was with me. He gave me strength to tell the message. All those who are not Jews heard it. And I was saved out of the mouth of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord will save me from every wrong thing. He will bring me safely into the kingdom of heaven. Praise him for ever and ever. Yes, he will!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, and to the people who belong to the house of Onesiphorus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Erastus stayed in the city of Corinth. Trophimus was sick when I left him at Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Try to come before the cold time of the year. Eubulus sends you greetings. So do Pudens, Linus, and Claudia and all the Christian brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Lord be with your spirit. May he in his kindness bless you. Amen. May it be so!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
