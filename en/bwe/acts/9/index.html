He said he would kill them. He went to the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He asked him for letters to take to the meeting places at Damascus. In this way he was given the power to catch any men or women disciples. He could tie them and bring them back to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He went on his way. All at once, near the city of Damascus, a light from the sky shone around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He fell to the ground and heard someone say, Saul, Saul, why are you troubling me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Saul said, Who are you, Lord? The Lord said, I am Jesus. You are troubling me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But get up and go to the city. There you will be told what you must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The men who had come with Saul stood there. They did not say a word. They heard a voice but did not see anyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Saul got up off the ground. When he opened his eyes, he was blind. They took his hand and led him to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For three days he could not see, and he did not eat or drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>A disciple named Ananias lived in Damascus. The Lord came to him in a vision and said.  Ananias. He replied, Here I am, Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Lord said, Go into the street which is called Straight. At the house of Judas, ask for a man named Saul, from the city of Tarsus. He is there, talking with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming to him. He has seen him put his hands on him so that he may see again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Ananias replied, Lord, often I have heard of this man. He has brought much trouble to your people at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The chief priests have given him power in this city to put into prison all those who call on your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord said, Go, I have chosen him to take my name to the people who are not Jews,  to kings, and to the people of Israel also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will show him how much he must suffer for my names sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Ananias went. He went into the house and put his hands on Saul. He said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus came to you on the road while you were coming here. He has sent me to you so that you may see again, and that you may be filled with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At once some kind of skin which had covered Sauls eyes came off. He was able to see again from then on. He got up and was baptised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had eaten food, he was strong again. Saul stayed for some days with the disciples at Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Right away he went to the Jewish meeting places and told the people that Jesus is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All the people who heard him were surprised. They said, This man killed the people who called on Jesus name in Jerusalem. He came here to catch them and tie them and take them to the chief priests!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul became stronger and stronger. He proved that Jesus is the Christ and made it so plain that the Jews at Damascus did not know what to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then some time after that, the leaders of the Jews planned to kill Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he found out that they were waiting for him. The Jewish leaders watched the gates of the city night and day. They were waiting for a chance to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then one night the disciples put him in a basket and let him down outside the city wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When Saul came to Jerusalem, he wanted to join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him. They did not believe that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them, Saul has seen the Lord on the road. The Lord has talked to him. After that he told Gods word in the name of Jesus, without fear at Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Saul stayed with the apostles and went around in Jerusalem. He told Gods word in the name of the Lord Jesus without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He talked to the Jews who spoke the Greek language. But they did not agree with Saul,  and so they made plans to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When the Christian brothers knew that, they took him to Caesarea. Then they sent him to Tarsus <FI>the city where he was born<Fi> .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>After that, the churches in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria were not troubled any more and they believed more strongly. The people obeyed the Lord, and the Holy Spirit helped them to believe. And many more people joined them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>While Peter was travelling through all the towns, he came to visit Gods people who lived in the city of Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>There he saw a man named Aeneas who was sick. He could not stand up. He had been on his bed for eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed! The man got up at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>All the people who lived at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>In the city of Joppa there was a disciple. Her name was Tabitha. That means Dorcas or Gazelle. She did much good work and she gave many things to the poor people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>She became sick and died. They bathed her body and put her in a room upstairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Lydda was near Joppa. When the disciples heard that Peter was at Lydda, they sent two men and asked for him to come quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Peter got up and went with them. When he got there, they took him to the room upstairs.  Women whose husbands were dead stood there crying. They showed Peter the clothes and coats that Dorcas had made for them while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Peter put them all out. He kneeled down and talked to God. He turned to the body and said, Tabitha, get up. She opened her eyes. When she saw Peter, she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He took her hand and helped her get up. Then he called in Gods people and the women,  and he gave her back to them alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>All over Joppa people heard about this. Many people believed on the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Peter stayed in Joppa for many days. He was with a man named Simon, who made skins into leather.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
