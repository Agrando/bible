The priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>They were angry at Peter and John because they taught the people. They were angry because they told them that Jesus was brought back from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They caught them and put them in prison until the next day, because it was already evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But many of the people who heard them speak the word of God, believed what they said.  The number of men who believed was about five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The next day their rulers, leaders, and scribes met in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all of the high priests family were there also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Peter and John were brought before them. They asked the apostles, By what power or in what name have you done this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and leaders of Israel, have you brought us to court today because of the good thing that was done to the lame man? Do you want to find out how he was healed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Well, let it be known by all the people of Israel. This man standing before you is healed by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth. He has done this. You nailed him to a cross, but God raised him from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus Christ is the stone which you, the builders, would not use. But he is now the chief corner stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No one else can save us. Of all the people in the world, God chose him to save us. It is by him we must be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They saw that Peter and John were not afraid to speak out. They knew that they were like any other men. They did not have much training. So the people were very much surprised. They knew that Peter and John had been with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They saw the man who had been healed standing beside them. So they could say nothing against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They told Peter and John to leave the court. Then they talked the matter over among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They said, What shall we do to these men? All the people who live in Jerusalem know about this big work they have done. And we cannot say they did not do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But we do not want any more people to hear about it. So let us say to these men, "Take care! Never speak to anyone in this name again."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They called them in and said, Never speak or teach in this name again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Peter and John answered them, How does God look at it? Is it right for us to obey you or to obey him? You judge that for yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As for us, we must tell the things we have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the high priest and those with him told them again. Then they let them go. They could not punish them because of the people. They all praised God for what had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The man who had been healed was more than forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When they were free, Peter and John went back to their own friends. They told them all that the chief priests and leaders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When they heard it, they talked to God together. They said, Lord, you are God. You made the sky, and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Our father David was your servant. Through him you said by the Holy Spirit, "Why are the people who are not Jews so angry? And why do the people plan things for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The kings of the earth joined their forces. And the rulers met together against the Lord and his Christ."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It is true that Herod and Pontius Pilate met together with Jews and those who were not Jews here in this city. They met to make secret plans against your holy Son Jesus, whom you made Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But they only did what you had already planned should be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Lord, hear their words. Listen to the wrong things they say against us. We are your servants. Help us to speak your word without fear. And heal the sick by your own power.  Let signs and wonderful things be done in the name of your holy Son Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they had talked to God, the room they were in shook. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. And they spoke the word of God without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>All the believers were one in heart and mind. Not one of them said, This is mine. But everything they had was for the use of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>With much power the apostles told how the Lord Jesus was raised from death. And God blessed them all very much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>None of them was in need of anything. Those who owned fields and houses sold them.  They brought the money to the apostles. Then the apostles gave each one what he needed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>There was a man named Joseph, a Levite. He was born in the country of Cyprus. The apostles called him Barnabas. That means "one who helps."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He had a field and sold it. He brought the money to the apostles and gave it to them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
