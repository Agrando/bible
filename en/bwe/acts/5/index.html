He brought some of the money to the apostles. But he kept the rest of it. His wife knew what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart? Why do you lie to the Holy Spirit?  You have kept some of the money which you got for the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As long as you had the field, it belonged to you. When you had the money, you could do what you wanted to do with it. Why then did you plan to do a thing like this? You have not lied to men, but to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As Ananias heard Peters words, he fell down and died. All who heard these things were very much afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The young men came and wrapped him up. They carried him out and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>About three hours later, his wife came in. She did not know what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Peter asked her, Tell me, did you sell the field for so much money? and she answered,  Yes, that is how much it was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Peter said to her, Why did you two agree together to test the Spirit of the Lord?  Listen, I hear the footsteps of the men who buried your husband. They are at the door.  They will carry you out too.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she fell down at Peters feet and died. The young men came in and saw that she was dead. They carried her out and buried her beside her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then all the church people, and all the people who heard about this were very much afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The apostles did many signs and wonderful things for the people who met together in the place called Solomons porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Other people feared to join them, but they spoke well of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Many more men and women believed and came to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They brought sick people out into the streets and laid them on beds and mats. They hoped that at least Peters shadow would touch them as he passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Many people also came from the cities around Jerusalem. They brought others who were sick and those who were controlled by bad spirits. Every one of them was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some Sadducees were with the high priest. They all became very jealous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They caught the apostles and put them in prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But that night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Go, said the angel. Stand in the temple and tell the people all about this new life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When the apostles heard that, they went into the temple early in the morning and taught the people there. The high priest and his men came. They called a meeting of the court and all the leaders of the Jews. Then they sent men to the prison to bring the apostles out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When the men came to the prison, they did not find the apostles there. Then they went back and told the high priest and those with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said, The prison was locked very well. And the police were guarding the doors.  But when we opened the doors, no one was inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When the high priest, the captain of the temple, and the chief priests heard this, they did not know what to think. We wonder what will come from all this, they thought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Just then someone came and told them, The men you put in prison are standing in the temple teaching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the captain went with the men and brought the apostles quietly. They did not bring them by force because they were afraid the people would kill them with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So they brought them in and put them before the court. The high priest asked them, Did we not tell you that you must never teach again in this name? But here you are, teaching people all over Jerusalem in this name. You are trying to put on us the blame for this mans death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter and the other apostles answered them, We must obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, the one you killed by hanging on a dead tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>God has made him great at his right side. He has made him leader and Saviour. He has done this so that the people of Israel may stop doing wrong things and be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We know these things are true. So does the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the judges heard this, they were very, very angry and wanted to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then a lawyer named Gamaliel stood up in the court. He was a Pharisee and all the people respected him. He asked that the apostles be taken out for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then he said, Men of Israel, you had better take care what you plan to do to these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Before this time, there was a man named Theudas. He tried to make people believe that he was a great man. He had about four hundred followers. He was killed, and all of his followers were scattered, and the whole thing ended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then after that, at tax time, another man named Judas from Galilee made trouble. Many people followed him. He also was killed and all of his followers were scattered. 38,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So now, I say, do nothing to these men. Leave them alone. If this is the teaching or work of men, it will come to an end. But if it is of God, you cannot stop these men. You might even be fighting against God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They agreed to do what he said. They called in the apostles and had them beaten. They told them not to speak in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The apostles left the court. They were very glad to think that God let them be punished for the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Every day, in the temple and in homes, they kept on teaching and talking about Jesus Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
