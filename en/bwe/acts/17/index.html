Then they reached the town of Thessalonica. Here the Jews had a meeting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As he had done in other places, Paul went into it. On three Sabbath days he explained what was written in the holy writings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He proved these things from the writings. He said. It was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise again from death. And this Jesus, whom I am talking about, is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Some of the people believed him and they followed Paul and Silas. Some of them were Greek people who worshipped God. And some were leading women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But some Jews did not believe, and they were jealous. So they called some of the bad men together and made a crowd. They started to fight and to make plenty of trouble and noise in the city. At Jasons house they went in by force to find Paul and Silas. They wanted to bring them outside to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But they did not find them. So they took Jason and some of the Christian brothers to the rulers of the city. They shouted, These men have turned the world upside down. Now they have come here also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jason has taken them into his house. None of them obeys the laws of Caesar. They say there is another king named Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the people and the rulers of the city became angry when they heard this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They made Jason and the other Christians pay much money. Then they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>That night the Christian brothers sent Paul and Silas to the town of Berea. When they reached there, they went into the Jews meeting place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The people in Berea were better than the people of Thessalonica. They were glad to listen to Pauls words. Every day they studied the holy writings to see if what Paul said was right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Through this, many of them believed. Some of the leading women of the Greek people and some of the men also believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The leaders of the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul told the word of God to the people at Berea. They came to Berea and talked to the people. They said things that made the people very angry against Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Christian brothers sent Paul to the seaside right away. But Silas and Timothy stayed on at Berea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The men took Paul to the city of Athens. Paul told them to tell Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as they could.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy at Athens. He saw that the city was full of idols.  His spirit was troubled about this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the meeting place he talked with the Jews and those who believed in the true God. In the market every day, he talked to people he met there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There were some wise men who believed the teachings of Epicurius. They believed the teaching of other wise men called Stoics. Some of them began to talk with Paul. And some said, What does this talker have to say? Others said, He seems to be talking about new gods. This was because he was telling them about Jesus and how he was raised from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they took Paul and brought him to a meeting at the hill called Areopagus. They said,  We want to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You are telling us things we never heard before. We want to understand them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All the people of Athens and the strangers who lived there passed their time in one way.  They liked to tell and to hear some new thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Paul stood up in the court and said, You men of Athens, I see that you are very religious and worship many gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As I walked about, I looked at the things you worship. I saw one place where you make sacrifices. You have written on it, "To the God we do not know." You are worshipping that God, but you do not know him. I will tell you about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He made the world and everything in it. He is the Lord of the sky and the earth. He does not live in houses that people make with their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Men cannot worship him by things they make with their hands because he does not need anything. He is the one who gives life and breath and everything else to all people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>God made one man. From that one man he has made all the nations of men to live on the whole earth. He has given to each nation a certain time and a certain place to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He did this so they would look for him. He wanted them to reach out and find him. But he is not far from each one of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In him we live, and move, and are alive. Some of your own writers have said, "We have come from him".</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore we have all come from God. So we should not think that God is something made of gold, or silver, or stone. He is not made by mens hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In times past God did not look at what people did. They did not know any better then.  But now he is calling all people to stop doing those things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>God has set a day when he will judge the whole world in the right way. He has chosen a man to do this. He has proved to all people who the man is. He has raised him from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>When the people of Athens heard that someone had been raised from death, some of them laughed. Others said, We want to hear you talk about this matter again some time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So then Paul left them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But some men followed him and believed. Among those who believed was Dionysius. He was a judge in the Areopagus court. And a woman named Damaris believed. There were others also.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
