I want them to understand everything. I want them to know in a more perfect way about Gods plan, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All the wonderful things there are to know about the plan are found in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I say this so that no one may lead you the wrong way by their fine words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even though I am not with you in body, I am with you in spirit. I am happy to see that you stand together well and that you keep on believing in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You received Christ Jesus the Lord. So live in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let your heart be planted in him. Grow up in him. Believe with all your heart what you were taught. And be very thankful to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do not let anyone fool you by his wise words. They are not true. They are what men say. They are the teachings of this world and not what Christ says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Christ has everything that God has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you, too, have everything when you are in him. He rules over every power and ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>In Christ you were not circumcised by mens hands. But you were circumcised in Christs way when all the wrong things you did in your bodies were taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You were buried with Christ when you were baptised. You were also raised with him to a new life when you were baptised. You were raised because you believed in the power of God who raised Christ from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You were dead because of the wrong things you had done, and because your lives had not been made clean. But God gave you life with Christ. He forgave you for all the wrong things you did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He wiped out all the things that were written against us in the laws. He took the writing away and nailed it to a cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He won the victory over powers and rulers. He showed that they had no power at all. He showed the world his victory through the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So do not let anyone say you are wrong about what you eat or drink, or about a feast, or a special holy day or a Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are like a shadow of what is to come. But Christ is the body that makes the shadow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do not let anyone tell you that you are wrong and that to be humble you must worship angels. He talks about things he has not seen. He is very proud, but he has nothing to be proud of, because his thoughts come from his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He is not joined to the real head which is Christ. It is from him that the whole body receives strength and is held together by its joints and muscles. It is from him that the body grows as God makes it grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Did you die with Christ? Then you left the teachings of this world. So why do you obey laws as if you were still living in this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I mean laws like this: "Do not touch that. Do not eat this. Do not put your hand on that."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All such things are gone as soon as they are used. These are laws made and taught by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These laws look as if they are good laws. They make a show of doing things for God.  They make people humble themselves in some way. They make people control their bodies in certain ways. But they have no power to keep people from doing all the wrong things they want to do.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
