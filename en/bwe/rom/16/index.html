They make people do wrong because they teach things you have not been taught. Have nothing to do with those people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Those people do not work for our Lord Jesus Christ. They work only for themselves.

The message was kept secret for a long time in the past. But it has now been made known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The books of the prophets have told this message. The God who lives for ever told the prophets to write this message so that all the people who are not Jews will believe and obey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>God is the only one who is wise.
