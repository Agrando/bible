Do not judge what he thinks about things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>One person believes he may eat anything. Another person, who does not believe that,  eats only things that grow in the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The one who eats anything must not despise the one who does not eat everything. And the one who does not eat must not judge the person who does. God has accepted him as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why do you judge another persons servant? He stands or he falls before his own master.  But he will stand because the Lord can give him power to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>One man thinks, This day is better than that day. But another man thinks, All days are alike. Every man should be sure in his own mind what he believes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>One man honours the day to honour the Lord; another man does not honour the day to honour the Lord. The person who eats everything, eats it because he honours the Lord.  And he thanks God. And the person who will not eat every kind of food also does so to honour the Lord. And he still gives thanks to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Not one of us lives for himself. And not one of us dies for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If we live, we live for the Lord. And if we die, we die for the Lord. So then, if we live or if we die we belong to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Christ wanted to be Lord, both of dead people and of living people. That is why he died and lived again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? We shall all stand before God to be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The holy writings say, The Lord says, "As sure as I live, every knee will bow to me.  Every tongue will praise God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So each of us will tell God about what he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So we must not judge each other any longer. But it is better for us to judge this. Never put anything in a brothers way that will hurt him or that will make him fall down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As a Christian, I know and believe that nothing in itself is not right to eat. But it is not right for anyone to eat who thinks it is not right to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Does what you eat trouble your brother? If it does, you are no longer living in love. Do not destroy the faith of someone because of what you eat. Christ died for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What is good for you must not be something that other people say is wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The kingdom of God is not about what a person eats and drinks. But it is about living in a way which is right with God. It is peace. It is joy because a person has the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A person who does the work of Christ in this way pleases God. And people like him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But we must do the things that make peace and that help each other to do better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not spoil what God has done because you want some food. Everything is right. But it is wrong for anyone to eat anything if that will make his brother fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The right thing is to eat no meat, and drink no wine, and not do anything that makes your brother fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Keep to yourself and God what you believe about these things. God blesses a man who does not feel he has done wrong when he did what he thought was right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But a man who is not sure that he should eat something, does wrong if he eats it. That is because he does not believe the thing he is doing is right to do. And it is wrong to do what you do not believe is right.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
