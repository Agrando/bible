Moreover I tell you that Yahweh will build you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It shall happen, when your days are fulfilled that you must go to be with your fathers, that I will set up your seed after you, who shall be of your sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom forever; and his throne shall be established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This was a small thing in your eyes, God; but you have spoken of your servant`s house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, Yahweh God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What can David [say] yet more to you concerning the honor which is done to your servant? for you know your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yahweh, for your servant`s sake, and according to your own heart, have you worked all this greatness, to make known all [these] great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yahweh, there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to himself for a people, to make you a name by great and awesome things, in driving out nations from before your people, whom you redeem out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For your people Israel did you make your own people forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now, Yahweh, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, be established forever, and do as you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let your name be established and magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of Hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and the house of David your servant is established before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build him a house: therefore has your servant found [in his heart] to pray before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now, Yahweh, you are God, and have promised this good thing to your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and now it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you: for you, Yahweh, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
