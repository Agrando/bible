Why Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. All those of Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew sword: and in Judah were four hundred seventy thousand men who drew sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he didn`t count Levi and Benjamin among them; for the king`s word was abominable to Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beg you, the iniquity of your servant; for I have done very foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yahweh spoke to Gad, David`s seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose you one of them, that I may do it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Take which you will:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or else three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Yahweh saw, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay your hand. The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and the sky, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David said to God, Isn`t it I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is even I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father`s house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to tell David, that David should go up, and raise an altar to Yahweh in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing floor, that I may build thereon an altar to Yahweh: for the full price shall you give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: behold, I give [you] the oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>King David said to Ornan, No; but I will most assuredly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is your for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings and peace-offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from the sky by fire on the altar of burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the tent of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But David couldn`t go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
