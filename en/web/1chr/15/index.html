and he prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has Yahweh chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of Yahweh to its place, which he had prepared for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David gathered together the sons of Aaron, and the Levites:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brothers one hundred twenty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred twenty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brothers one hundred thirty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brothers two hundred;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brothers eighty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brothers one hundred twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and said to them, You are the heads of the fathers` [houses] of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both you and your brothers, that you may bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel, to [the place] that I have prepared for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For because you didn`t carry it at the first, Yahweh our God made a breach on us, because we didn`t seek him according to the ordinance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The children of the Levites bore the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brothers the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel;
