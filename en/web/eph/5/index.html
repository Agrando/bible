For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Don`t be therefore partakers with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the things which are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that is revealed is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore he says, "Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore don`t be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Don`t be drunken with wine, in which is an abandoned life, but be filled with the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing, and singing praises in your heart to the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the assembly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. The two will become one flesh."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This mystery is great, but I speak in regard of Christ and of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
