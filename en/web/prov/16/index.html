By the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When a man`s ways please Yahweh,    He makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Better is a little with righteousness,    Than great revenues with injustice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A man`s heart plans his course,    But Yahweh directs his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king.    His shall not betray his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Honest balances and scales are Yahweh`s;    All the weights in the bag are his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is an abomination for kings to do wrong,    For the throne is established by righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Righteous lips are the delight of kings.    They value one who speaks the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The king`s wrath is a messenger of death,    But a wise man will pacify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the light of the king`s face is life.    His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>How much better it is to get wisdom than gold!    Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The highway of the upright is to depart from evil.    He who keeps his way preserves his soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pride goes before destruction,    A haughty spirit before a fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,    Than to divide the plunder with the proud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who gives heed to the word finds prosperity.    Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wise in heart shall be called prudent.    Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it,    But the punishment of fools is their folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The heart of the wise instructs his mouth,    And adds learning to his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pleasant words are a honeycomb,    Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There is a way which seems right to a man,    But in the end it leads to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The appetite of the laboring man labors for him;    For his mouth urges him on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>A worthless man devises mischief.    His speech is like a scorching fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A perverse man stirs up strife.    A whisperer separates close friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A man of violence entices his neighbor,    And leads him in a way that is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>One who winks his eyes to plot perversities,    One who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Gray hair is a crown of glory.    It is attained by a life of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty;    One who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The lot is cast into the lap,    But its every decision is from Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
