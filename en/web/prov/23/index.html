In your wisdom, show restraint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why do you set your eyes on that which is not?    For it certainly sprouts wings like an eagle and flies in the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Don`t eat the food of him who has a stingy eye,    And don`t crave his delicacies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For as he thinks about the cost, so he is.    "Eat and drink!" he says to you,    But his heart is not with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The morsel which you have eaten you shall vomit up,    And lose your good words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Don`t speak in the ears of a fool,    For he will despise the wisdom of your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Don`t move the ancient boundary stone.    Don`t encroach on the fields of the fatherless:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For their Defender is strong.    He will plead their case against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Apply your heart to instruction,    And your ears to the words of knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Don`t withhold correction from a child.    If you punish him with the rod, he will not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Punish him with the rod,    And save his soul from Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My son, if your heart is wise,    Then my heart will be glad, even mine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yes, my heart will rejoice,    When your lips speak what is right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Don`t let your heart envy sinners;    But rather fear Yahweh all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Indeed surely there is a future hope,    And your hope will not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Listen, my son, and be wise,    And keep your heart on the right path!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Don`t be among ones drinking too much wine,    Or those who gorge themselves on meat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the drunkard and the glutton shall become poor;    And drowsiness clothes them in rags.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Listen to your father who gave you life,    And don`t despise your mother when she is old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Buy the truth, and don`t sell it:    Get wisdom, discipline, and understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The father of the righteous has great joy.    Whoever fathers a wise child delights in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let your father and your mother be glad!    Let her who bore you rejoice!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My son, give me your heart;    And let your eyes keep in my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For a prostitute is a deep pit;    And a wayward wife is a narrow well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yes, she lies in wait like a robber,    And increases the unfaithful among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife?    Who has complaints? Who has needless bruises? Who has bloodshot eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Those who stay long at the wine;    Those who go to seek out mixed wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Don`t look at the wine when it is red,     When it sparkles in the cup,    When it goes down smoothly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>At the last it bites like a snake,    And poisons like a viper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Your eyes will see strange things,    And your mind will imagine confusing things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yes, you will be as he who lies down in the midst of the sea,    Or as he who lies on top of the rigging:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>"They hit me, and I was not hurt;    They beat me, and I don`t feel it!    When will I wake up? I can do it again.    I can find another."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
