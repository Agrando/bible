Pay attention and know understanding;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For I give you sound learning.    Don`t forsake my law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I was a son to my father,    Tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He taught me, and said to me:    "Let your heart retain my words.    Keep my commandments, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Get wisdom. Get understanding.    Don`t forget, neither swerve from the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Don`t forsake her, and she will preserve you.    Love her, and she will keep you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom.    Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Esteem her, and she will exalt you.    She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She will give to your head a garland of grace.    A crown of splendor will she deliver to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Listen, my son, and receive my sayings.    The years of your life will be many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have taught you in the way of wisdom.    I have led you in paths of uprightness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you go, your steps will not be hampered.    When you run, you will not stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Take firm hold of instruction.    Don`t let her go.    Keep her, for she is your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Don`t enter into the path of the wicked.    Don`t walk in the way of evil men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Avoid it, and don`t pass by it.    Turn from it, and pass on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For they don`t sleep, unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For they eat the bread of wickedness,    And drink the wine of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light,    That shines more and more until the perfect day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of the wicked is like darkness.    They don`t know what they stumble over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My son, attend to my words.    Turn your ear to my sayings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Let them not depart from your eyes.    Keep them in the midst of your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For they are life to those who find them,    And health to their whole body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Keep your heart with all diligence,    For out of it is the wellspring of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Put away from yourself a perverse mouth.    Put corrupt lips far from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let your eyes look straight ahead.    Fix your gaze directly before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Make the path of your feet level.    Let all of your ways be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Don`t turn to the right hand nor to the left.    Remove your foot from evil.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
