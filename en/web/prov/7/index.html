Lay up my commandments within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Keep my commandments and live;    Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Bind them on your fingers.    Write them on the tablet of your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell wisdom, "You are my sister."    Call understanding your relative,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That they may keep you from the strange woman,    From the foreigner who flatters with her words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For at the window of my house,    I looked forth through my lattice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw among the simple ones.    I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Passing through the street near her corner,    He went the way to her house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In the twilight, in the evening of the day,    In the middle of the night and in the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute,    And with crafty intent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She is loud and defiant.    Her feet don`t stay in her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now she is in the streets, now in the squares,    And lurking at every corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So she caught him, and kissed him.    With an impudent face she said to him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me.    This day I have paid my vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore I came out to meet you,    To diligently seek your face,    And I have found you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,    With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come, let`s take our fill of loving until the morning.    Let`s solace ourselves with loving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For my husband isn`t at home.    He has gone on a long journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He has taken a bag of money with him.    He will come home at the full moon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>With persuasive words, she led him astray.    With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He followed her immediately,    As an ox goes to the slaughter,    As a fool stepping into a noose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Until an arrow strikes through his liver,    As a bird hurries to the snare,    And doesn`t know that it will cost his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now therefore, sons, listen to me.    Pay attention to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Don`t let your heart turn to her ways.    Don`t go astray in her paths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For she has thrown down many wounded.    Yes, all her slain are a mighty host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Her house is the way to Sheol,    Going down to the chambers of death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
