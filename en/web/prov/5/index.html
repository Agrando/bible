Turn your ear to my understanding:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>That you may maintain discretion,    That your lips may preserve knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the lips of an adulteress drip honey.    Her mouth is smoother than oil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood,    And as sharp as a two-edged sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Her feet go down to death.    Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>She gives no thought to the way of life.    Her ways are crooked, and she doesn`t know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore, my sons, listen to me.    Don`t depart from the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remove your way far from her.    Don`t come near the door of her house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lest you give your honor to others,    And your years to the cruel one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Lest strangers feast on your wealth,    And your labors enrich another man`s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You will groan at your latter end,    When your flesh and your body are consumed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And say, "How I have hated instruction,    And my heart despised reproof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,    Nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have come to the brink of utter ruin,    In the midst of the gathered assembly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Drink water out of your own cistern,    Running water out of your own well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Should your springs overflow in the streets,    Streams of water in the public squares?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let them be for yourself alone,    Not for strangers with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let your spring be blessed.    Rejoice in the wife of your youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>A loving hind and a pleasant doe --    Let her breasts satisfy you at all times.    Be captivated always with her love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress?    Why embrace the bosom of another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh.    He examines all his paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him.    The cords of his sin hold him firmly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He will die for lack of instruction.    In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
