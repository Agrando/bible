Bind them around your neck.    Write them on the tablet of your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God       and man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Trust in Yahweh with all your heart,    And don`t lean on your own understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all your ways acknowledge him,    And he will direct your paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Don`t be wise in your own eyes.    Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It will be health to your body,    And nourishment to your bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Honor Yahweh with your substance,    With the first fruits of all your increase:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So your barns will be filled with plenty,    And your vats will overflow with new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My son, don`t despise Yahweh`s discipline,    Neither be weary of his reproof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For whom Yahweh loves, he reproves;    Even as a father the son in whom he delights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Happy is the man who finds wisdom,    The man who gets understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver,    The profit of it better than fine gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She is more precious than rubies.    None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Length of days is in her right hand.    In her left hand are riches and honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Her ways are ways of pleasantness.    All her paths are peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.    Happy is everyone who retains her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth.    By understanding, he established the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By his knowledge, the depths were broken up,    And the skies drop down the dew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, let them not depart from your eyes.    Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they will be life to your soul,    And grace for your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then you shall walk in your way securely.    Your foot won`t stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When you lie down, you will not be afraid.    Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Don`t be afraid of sudden fear,    Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Yahweh will be your confidence,    And will keep your foot from being taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Don`t withhold good from those to whom it is due,    When it is in the power of your hand to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Don`t say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again,    Tomorrow I will give,"    When you have it by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Don`t devise evil against your neighbor,    Seeing he dwells securely by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Don`t strive with a man without cause,    If he has done you no harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Don`t envy the man of violence.    Choose none of his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh,    But his friendship is with the upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The curse of Yahweh is in the house of the wicked,    But he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Surely he mocks the mockers,    But he gives grace to the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The wise will inherit glory,    But shame will be the promotion of fools.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
