Oh, son of my womb!    Oh, son of my vows!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Don`t give your strength to women,    Nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It is not for kings, Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine;    Nor for princes to say, `Where is strong drink?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Lest they drink, and forget the law,    And pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish;    And wine to the bitter in soul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let him drink, and forget his poverty,    And remember his misery no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Open your mouth for the mute,    In the cause of all who are left desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Open your mouth, judge righteously,    And serve justice to the poor and needy."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who can find a worthy woman?    For her price is far above rubies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The heart of her husband trusts in her.    He shall have no lack of gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She does him good, and not harm,    All the days of her life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>She seeks wool and flax,    And works eagerly with her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She is like the merchant ships.    She brings her bread from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>She rises also while it is yet night,    Gives food to her household,    And their task to her servant girls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She considers a field, and buys it.    With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She girds her loins with strength,    And makes her arms strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She perceives that her merchandise is profitable.    Her lamp doesn`t go out by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>She lays her hands to the distaff,    And her hands hold the spindle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>She stretches out her hand to the poor;    Yes, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>She is not afraid of the snow for her household;    For all her household are clothed with scarlet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>She makes for herself carpets of tapestry.    Her clothing is fine linen and purple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Her husband is respected in the gates,    When he sits among the elders of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>She makes linen garments and sells them,    And delivers sashes to the merchant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Strength and dignity are her clothing.    She laughs at the time to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She opens her mouth with wisdom.    The law of kindness is on her tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She looks well to the ways of her household,    And doesn`t eat the bread of idleness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Her children rise up and call her blessed.    Her husband also praises her:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>"Many women do noble things,    But you excel them all."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain;    But a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Give her of the fruit of her hands;    Let her works praise her in the gates.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
