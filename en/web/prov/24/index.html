The mocker is detested by men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you falter in the time of trouble,    Your strength is small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Rescue those who are being led away to death!    Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If you say, "Behold, we didn`t know this;"    Doesn`t he who weighs the hearts consider it?     He who keeps your soul, doesn`t he know it?    Shall he not render to every man according to his work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>My son, eat honey, for it is good;    The droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So you shall know wisdom to be to your soul;    If you have found it, then will there be a reward,    Your hope will not be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Don`t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous.    Don`t destroy his resting-place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again;    But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Don`t rejoice when your enemy falls.    Don`t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him,    And he turn away his wrath from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Don`t fret yourself because of evildoers;    Neither be envious of the wicked:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For there will be no reward to the evil man;    And the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My son, fear Yahweh and the king.    Don`t join those who are rebellious:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For their calamity will rise suddenly;    The destruction from them both -- who knows?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These also are sayings of the wise.     To show partiality in judgment is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who says to the wicked, "You are righteous;"    Peoples shall curse him, and nations shall abhor him --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But it will go well with those who convict the guilty,    And a rich blessing will come on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>An honest answer    Is like a kiss on the lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Prepare your work outside.    Make it ready for you in the field.    Afterwards, build your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Don`t be a witness against your neighbor without cause.
