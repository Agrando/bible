Won`t you tell me? Amnon said to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom`s sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jonadab said to him, Lay you down on your bed, and feign yourself sick: and when your father comes to see you, tell him, Please let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and dress the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Amnon lay down, and feigned himself sick: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said to the king, Please let her sister Tamar come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to your brother Amnon`s house, and dress him food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon`s house; and he was laid down. She took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She took the pan, and poured them out before him; but he refused to eat. Amnon said, Have out all men from me. They went out every man from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Amnon said to Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand. Tamar took the cakes which she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When she had brought them near to him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, Come, lie with me, my sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She answered him, No, my brother, do not force me; for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Don`t you do this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I, where shall I carry my shame? and as for you, you will be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, please speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>However he would not listen to her voice; but being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Amnon hated her with exceeding great hatred; for the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. Amnon said to her, Arise, be gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She said to him, Not so, because this great wrong in putting me forth is [worse] than the other that you did to me. But he would not listen to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he called his servant who ministered to him, and said, Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She had a garment of various colors on her; for with such robes were the king`s daughters who were virgins dressed. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the door after her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Tamar put ashes on her head, and tore her garment of various colors that was on her; and she laid her hand on her head, and went her way, crying aloud as she went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but now hold your peace, my sister: he is your brother; don`t take this thing to heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom`s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when king David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Absalom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It happened after two full years, that Absalom had sheep-shearers in Baal-hazor, which is beside Ephraim: and Absalom invited all the king`s sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Absalom came to the king, and said, See now, your servant has sheep-shearers; let the king, I pray you, and his servants go with your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you. He pressed him: however he would not go, but blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then said Absalom, If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us. The king said to him, Why should he go with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Absalom pressed him, and he let Amnon and all the king`s sons go with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Absalom commanded his servants, saying, Mark you now, when Amnon`s heart is merry with wine; and when I tell you, Smite Amnon, then kill him; don`t be afraid; haven`t I commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king`s sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It happened, while they were in the way, that the news came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king`s sons, and there is not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the king arose, and tore his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David`s brother, answered, Don`t let my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king`s sons; for Amnon only is dead; for by the appointment of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore don`t let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king`s sons are dead; for Amnon only is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But Absalom fled. The young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people by the way of the hill-side behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jonadab said to the king, Behold, the king`s sons are come: as your servant said, so it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>It happened, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that behold, the king`s sons came, and lifted up their voice, and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammihur, king of Geshur. [David] mourned for his son every day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>[the soul of] king David longed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
