My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My savior, you save me from violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the waves of death compassed me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In my distress I called on Yahweh; Yes, I called to my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, My cry [came] into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked Were shaken, because he was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, Fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; Thick darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He rode on a cherub, and did fly; Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yahweh thundered from heaven, The Most High uttered his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and confused them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came on me in the day of my calamity; But Yahweh was my stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, And have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his ordinances were before me; As for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I was also perfect toward him; I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore has Yahweh recompensed me according to my       righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With the pure you will show yourself pure; With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The afflicted people you will save; But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For you are my lamp, Yahweh; Yahweh will lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For by you I run on a troop; By my God do I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Yahweh is tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who is God, save Yahweh? Who is a rock, save our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God is my strong fortress; He guides the perfect in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He makes his feet like hinds` [feet], Sets me on my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He teaches my hands to war, So that my arms do bend a bow of brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You have also given me the shield of your salvation; Your gentleness has made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You have enlarged my steps under me; My feet have not slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again until they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they       can`t arise: Yes, they are fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For you have girded me with strength to the battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, That I might cut off those who hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They looked, but there was none to save; Even to Yahweh, but he didn`t answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then did I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I did crush them as the mire of the streets, and did spread them abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people; You have kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The foreigners shall submit themselves to me: As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The foreigners shall fade away, Shall come trembling out of their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yahweh lives; Blessed be my rock; Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Even the God who executes vengeance for me, Who brings down peoples under me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Who brings me forth from my enemies: Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me; You deliver me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations, Will sing praises to your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Great deliverance gives he to his king, Shows lovingkindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, forevermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
