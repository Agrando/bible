For Yahweh had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, to the intent that Yahweh might bring evil on Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then said Hushai to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counseled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Don`t lodge this night at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people who are with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying by En-rogel; and a maid-servant used to go and tell them; and they went and told king David: for they might not be seen to come into the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But a boy saw them, and told Absalom: and they went both of them away quickly, and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court; and they went down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman took and spread the covering over the well`s mouth, and strewed bruised grain thereon; and nothing was known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Absalom`s servants came to the woman to the house; and they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? The woman said to them, They have gone over the brook of water. When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It happened, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well, and went and told king David; and they said to David, Arise you, and pass quickly over the water; for thus has Ahithophel counseled against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they passed over the Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not one of them who had not gone over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, and arose, and got him home, to his city, and set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then David came to Mahanaim. Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Absalom set Amasa over the host instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man, whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab`s mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It happened, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and meal, and parched [grain], and beans, and lentils, and parched [pulse],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David, and for the people who were with him, to eat: for they said, The people are hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the wilderness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
