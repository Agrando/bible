So they were shut up to the day of their death, living in widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said the king to Amasa, Call me the men of Judah together within three days, and be you here present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So Amasa went to call [the men of] Judah together; but he stayed longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>David said to Abishai, Now will Sheba the son of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take your lord`s servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fortified cities, and escape out of our sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There went out after him Joab`s men, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Joab was girded with his apparel of war that he had put on, and thereon was a sash with a sword fastened on his loins in the sheath of it; and as he went forth it fell out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Joab said to Amasa, Is it well with you, my brother? Joab took Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab`s hand: so he struck him therewith in the body, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and didn`t strike him again; and he died. Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There stood by him one of Joab`s young men, and said, He who favors Joab, and he who is for David, let him follow Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the midst of the highway. When the man saw that all the people stood still, he carried Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a garment over him, when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Beth-maacah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered together, and went also after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They came and besieged him in Abel of Beth-maacah, and they cast up a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart; and all the people who were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then cried a wise woman out of the city, "Hear, hear! Please say to Joab, `Come near here, that I may speak with you.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He came near to her; and the woman said, Are you Joab? He answered, I am. Then she said to him, Hear the words of your handmaid. He answered, I do hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then she spoke, saying, They were wont to speak in old time, saying, They shall surely ask [counsel] at Abel: and so they ended [the matter].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel: you seek to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why will you swallow up the inheritance of Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Joab answered, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should swallow up or destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The matter is not so: but a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand against the king, even against David; deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. The woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the woman went to all the people in her wisdom. They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and threw it out to Joab. He blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed from the city, every man to his tent. Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now Joab was over all the host of Israel; and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and Adoram was over the men subject to forced labor; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was the recorder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and Sheva was scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and also Ira the Jairite was chief minister to David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
