He said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David said to him, How went the matter? Please tell me. He answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>David said to the young man who told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The young man who told him said, As I happened by chance on Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning on his spear; and, behold, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. I answered, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to me, Who are you? I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and kill me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I stood beside him, and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David took hold on his clothes, and tore them; and likewise all the men who were with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>David said to the young man who told him, Whence are you? He answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David said to him, How were you not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh`s anointed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. He struck him, so that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh`s anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(and he bade them teach the children of Judah [the song of] the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your glory, Israel, is slain on your high places! How are the mighty fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Don`t tell it in Gath, Don`t publish it in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain on you, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan didn`t turn back, The sword of Saul didn`t return empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, In their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold on your clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant have you been to me: Your love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How are the mighty fallen, The weapons of war perished!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
