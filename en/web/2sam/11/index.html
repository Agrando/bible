But David stayed at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>It happened at evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king`s house: and from the roof he saw a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>David send and inquired after the woman. One said, Is not this Bath-sheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in to him, and he lay with her (for she was purified from her uncleanness); and she returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>David sent to Joab, [saying], Send me Uriah the Hittite. Joab sent Uriah to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When Uriah was come to him, David asked of him how Joab did, and how the people fared, and how the war prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David said to Uriah, Go down to your house, and wash your feet. Uriah departed out of the king`s house, and there followed him a mess [of food] from the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Uriah slept at the door of the king`s house with all the servants of his lord, and didn`t go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When they had told David, saying, Uriah didn`t go down to his house, David said to Uriah, Haven`t you come from a journey? why did you not go down to your house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Uriah said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah, abide in booths; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open field; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>David said to Uriah, Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day, and the next day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When David had called him, he ate and drink before him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, but didn`t go down to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It happened in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He wrote in the letter, saying, Set you Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retire you from him, that he may be struck, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It happened, when Joab kept watch on the city, that he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew that valiant men were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and there fell some of the people, even of the servants of David; and Uriah the Hittite died also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he charged the messenger, saying, "When you have made an end of telling all the things concerning the war to the king,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>it shall be that, if the king`s wrath arise, and he tells you, `Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Didn`t you know that they would shoot from the wall?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Didn`t a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?` then shall you say, `Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the messenger went, and came and showed David all that Joab had sent him for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and came out to us into the field, and we were on them even to the entrance of the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The shooters shot at your servants from off the wall; and some of the king`s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then David said to the messenger, Thus shall you tell Joab, Don`t let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another; make your battle more strong against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage you him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When the mourning was past, David sent and took her home to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
