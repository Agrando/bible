Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king`s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The king said, Where is your master`s son? Ziba said to the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem; for he said, Today will the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, all that pertains to Mephibosheth is yours. Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When king David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came out, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera. He came out, and cursed still as he came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus said Shimei when he cursed, Be gone, be gone, you man of blood, and base fellow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and, behold, you are [taken] in your own mischief, because you are a man of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please let me go over and take off his head."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The king said, What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, Curse David; who then shall say, Why have you done so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? let him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has invited him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be that Yahweh will look on the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hill-side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It happened, when Hushai the Archite, David`s friend, was come to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your friend? Why didn`t you go with your friend?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him will I abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again, whom should I serve? Shouldn`t I serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in your father`s presence, so will I be in your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give your counsel what we shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father`s concubines, that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred of your father: then will the hands of all who are with you be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father`s concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
