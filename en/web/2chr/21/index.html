His people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thirty-two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years: and he departed without being desired; and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
