Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel, the rulers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the Passover-offerings two thousand and six hundred [small cattle], and three hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel, his brothers, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the Passover-offerings five thousand [small cattle], and five hundred oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites by their courses, according to the king`s commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They killed the Passover, and the priests sprinkled [the blood which they received] of their hand, and the Levites flayed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They removed the burnt offerings, that they might give them according to the divisions of the fathers` houses of the children of the people, to offer to Yahweh, as it is written in the book of Moses. So did they with the oxen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They roasted the Passover with fire according to the ordinance: and the holy offerings boiled they in pots, and in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the children of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterward they prepared for themselves, and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron [were busied] in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night: therefore the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king`s seer; and the porters were at every gate: they didn`t need to depart from their service; for their brothers the Levites prepared for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So all the service of Yahweh was prepared the same day, to keep the Passover, and to offer burnt-offerings on the altar of Yahweh, according to the commandment of king Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The children of Israel who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There was no Passover like that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a Passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this Passover kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight against Carchemish by the Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? [I come] not against you this day, but against the house with which I have war; and God has commanded me to make haste: forbear you from [meddling with] God, who is with me, that he not destroy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and didn`t listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So his servants took him out of the chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had, and brought him to Jerusalem; and he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day; and they made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold, they are written in the lamentations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his good deeds, according to that which is written in the law of Yahweh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
