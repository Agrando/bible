He was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him with a great slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed in Judah one hundred twenty thousand in one day, all of them valiant men; because they had forsaken Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the king`s son, and Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah who was next to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The children of Israel carried away captive of their brothers two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a prophet of Yahweh was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out to meet the host that came to Samaria, and said to them, Behold, because Yahweh, the God of your fathers, was angry with Judah, he has delivered them into your hand, and you have slain them in a rage which has reached up to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now you purpose to keep under the children of Judah and Jerusalem for bondservants and bondmaids to you: [but] aren`t there even with you trespasses of your own against Yahweh your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now hear me therefore, and send back the captives, that you have taken captive of your brothers; for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and said to them, You shall not bring in the captives here: for you purpose that which will bring on us a trespass against Yahweh, to add to our sins and to our trespass; for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The men who have been mentioned by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all who were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them on donkeys, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to their brothers: then they returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time did king Ahaz send to the kings of Assyria to help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For again the Edomites had come and struck Judah, and carried away captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland, and of the South of Judah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aijalon, and Gederoth, and Soco with the towns of it, and Timnah with the towns of it, Gimzo also and the towns of it: and they lived there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For Yahweh brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had dealt wantonly in Judah, and trespassed sore against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came to him, and distressed him, but didn`t strengthen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of Yahweh, and out of the house of the king and of the princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria: but it didn`t help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against Yahweh, this same king Ahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus, which struck him; and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helped them, [therefore] will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up the doors of the house of Yahweh; and he made him altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In every city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of his acts, and all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, even in Jerusalem; for they didn`t bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
