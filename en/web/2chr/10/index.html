The people departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What counsel give you me to return answer to this people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They spoke to him, saying, If you be kind to this people, and please them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him, and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to them, What counsel give you, that we may return answer to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke that your father did put on us lighter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you tell the people who spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father`s loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king bade, saying, Come to me again the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chastised you with whips, but I [will chastise you] with scorpions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king didn`t listen to the people; for it was brought about of God, that Yahweh might establish his word, which he spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When all Israel saw that the king didn`t listen to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to your tents, Israel: now see to your own house, David. So all Israel departed to their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as for the children of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the men subject to forced labor; and the children of Israel stoned him to death with stones. King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
