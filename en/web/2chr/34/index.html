Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to your servants, they are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. Shaphan read therein before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It happened, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he tore his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king`s servant, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go you, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do according to all that is written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Hilkiah, and they whom the king [had commanded], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she lived in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to her to that effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>She said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Tell you the man who sent you to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on the inhabitants of it, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place, and it shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of Yahweh, thus shall you tell him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: As touching the words which you have heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because your heart was tender, and you did humble yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against the inhabitants of it, and have humbled yourself before me, and have torn your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, neither shall your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on the inhabitants of it. They brought back word to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand [to it]. The inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they didn`t depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
