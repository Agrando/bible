He who sounded the trumpet was by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I said to the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>in whatever place you hear the sound of the trumpet, resort you there to us; our God will fight for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So we worked in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let everyone with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, everyone [went with] his weapon [to] the water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
