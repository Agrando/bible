But they thought to do me mischief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I sent messengers to them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I can`t come down: why should the work cease, while I leave it, and come down to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They sent to me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then sent Sanballat his servant to me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>in which was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu says it, that you and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause you are building the wall: and you would be their king, according to these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You have also appointed prophets to preach of you at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then I sent to him, saying, There are no such things done as you say, but you feign them out of your own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it not be done. But now, [God], strengthen you my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I went to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to kill you; yes, in the night will they come to kill you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I discerned, and, behold, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remember, my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the wall was finished in the twenty-fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty-two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It happened, when all our enemies heard [of it], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was worked of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For there were many in Judah sworn to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also they spoke of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
