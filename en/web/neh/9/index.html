But you are a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and didn`t forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt, and had committed awful blasphemies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>yet you in your manifold mercies didn`t forsake them in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud didn`t depart from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way in which they should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You gave also your good Spirit to instruct them, and didn`t withhold your manna from their mouth, and gave them water for their thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yes, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, [and] they lacked nothing; their clothes didn`t grow old, and their feet didn`t swell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover you gave them kingdoms and peoples, which you did allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Their children also multiplied you as the stars of the sky, and brought them into the land concerning which you did say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and olive groves, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in your great goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their back, and killed your prophets that testified against them to turn them again to you, and they committed awful blasphemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after they had rest, they did evil again before you; therefore left you them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried to you, you heard from heaven; and many times did you deliver them according to your mercies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law. Yet they dealt proudly, and didn`t listen to your commandments, but sinned against your ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in them,) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yet many years did you bear with them, and testified against them by your Spirit through your prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gave you them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Nevertheless in your manifold mercies you did not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for you are a gracious and merciful God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keep covenant and lovingkindness, don`t let all the travail seem little before you, that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all your people, since the time of the kings of Assyria to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>However you are just in all that is come on us; for you have dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you did testify against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For they have not served you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave them, and in the large and fat land which you gave before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that you gave to our fathers to eat the fruit of it and the good of it, behold, we are servants in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>It yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, [and] our priests, seal to it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
