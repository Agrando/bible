Working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You are witnesses with God, how holy, righteously, and blamelessly we behaved ourselves toward you who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As you know how we exhorted, comforted, and implored everyone of you, as a father does his own children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you received from us the word of the message of God, you accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For you, brothers, became imitators of the assemblies of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus; for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they did from the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and didn`t please God, and are contrary to all men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always. But wrath has come on them to the uttermost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because we wanted to come to you -- indeed, I, Paul, once and again -- but Satan hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Isn`t it even you, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are our glory and our joy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
