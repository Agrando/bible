They have divided my land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And have cast lots for my people,    And have given a boy for a prostitute,    And sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon,    And all the regions of Philistia? Will you repay me?    And if you repay me,    I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because you have taken my silver and my gold,    And have carried my finest treasures into your temples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And have sold the children of Judah and the children of       Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks,    That you may remove them far from their border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold       them,    And will return your repayment on your own head;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of       the children of Judah,    And they will sell them to the men of Sheba,    To a faraway nation,    For Yahweh has spoken it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Proclaim this among the nations:    Prepare war.    Stir up the mighty men. Let all the warriors draw near.    Let them come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Beat your plowshares into swords,    And your pruning hooks into spears.    Let the weak say, "I am strong."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations,    And gather yourselves together." Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Let the nations arouse themselves,    And come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat;    For there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Put in the sickle;    For the harvest is ripe.    Come, tread, for the winepress is full,    The vats overflow, for their wickedness is great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision!    For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sun and the moon are darkened,    And the stars withdraw their shining."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yahweh will roar from Zion,    And thunder from Jerusalem;    And the heavens and the earth will shake;    But Yahweh will be a refuge to his people,    And a stronghold to the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God,    Dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. Then Jerusalem will be holy,    And no strangers will pass through her any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It will happen in that day,    That the mountains will drop down sweet wine,    The hills will flow with milk,    All the brooks of Judah will flow with waters;    And a fountain will come forth from the house of Yahweh,    And will water the valley of Shittim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Egypt will be a desolation,    And Edom will be a desolate wilderness,    For the violence done to the children of Judah,    Because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Judah will be inhabited forever,    And Jerusalem from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will cleanse their blood,    That I have not cleansed:    For Yahweh dwells in Zion."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
