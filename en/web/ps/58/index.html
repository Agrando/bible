Do you judge blamelessly, you sons of men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>No, in your heart you plot injustice.    You measure out the violence of your hands in the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The wicked go astray from the womb.    They are wayward as soon as they are born, speaking lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their poison is like the poison of a snake;    Like a deaf cobra that stops its ear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Which doesn`t listen to the voice of charmers,    No matter how skillful the charmer may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Break their teeth, God, in their mouth.    Break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let them vanish as water that flows away.    When they draw the bow, let their arrows be made blunt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let them be as a snail which melts and passes away,    Like the stillborn child, who has not seen the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Before your pots can feel the thorns,    He will sweep away, the green and the burning alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.    He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So that men shall say, "Most assuredly there is a reward for       the righteous. Most assuredly there is a God who judges the earth."      Psalm 59       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A poem by David, when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
