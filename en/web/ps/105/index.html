They ran as a river in the dry places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For he remembered his holy word,    And Abraham, his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He brought forth his people with joy,    His chosen with singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He gave them the lands of the nations.    They took the labor of the peoples in possession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>That they might keep his statutes,    And observe his laws.    Praise Yah!
