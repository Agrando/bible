You afflicted the peoples,    But you spread them abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For they didn`t get the land in possession by their own sword,    Neither did their own arm save them; But your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your face,    Because you were favorable to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are my King, God.    Command victories for Jacob!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Through you, will we push down our adversaries.
