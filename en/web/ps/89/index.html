With my mouth, I will make known your faithfulness to all       generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I indeed declare, "Love stands firm forever.    You established the heavens.    Your faithfulness is in them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>"I have made a covenant with my chosen one,    I have sworn to David, my servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>`I will establish your seed forever,    And build up your throne to all generations.`" Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh;    Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh?    Who among the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A very awesome God in the council of the holy ones,    To be feared above all those who are around him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yahweh, God of hosts, who is a mighty one, like you?    Yah, your faithfulness is around you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You rule the pride of the sea.    When its waves rise up, you calm them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.    You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The heavens are yours, the earth also is yours;    The world and its fullness. You have founded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The north and the south, you have created them.    Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You have a mighty arm.    Your hand is strong, and your right hand is exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.    Lovingkindness and truth go before your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.    They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In your name do they rejoice all day.    In your righteousness, they are exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you are the glory of their strength.    In your favor, our horn will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For our shield belongs to Yahweh;    Our king to the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then you spoke in vision to your saints,    And said, "I have bestowed strength on the warrior.    I have exalted a young man from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have found David, my servant.    I have anointed him with my holy oil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>With whom my hand shall be established.    My arm will also strengthen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>No enemy will tax him.    No wicked man will oppress him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will beat down his adversaries before him,    And strike those who hate him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness will be with him.    In my name, his horn will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I will set his hand also on the sea,    And his right hand on the rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He will call to me, `You are my Father,    My God, and the rock of my salvation!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I will also appoint him my firstborn,    The highest of the kings of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I will keep my lovingkindness for him forevermore.    My covenant will stand firm with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I will also make his seed endure forever,    And his throne as the days of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If his children forsake my law,    And don`t walk in my ordinances;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If they break my statutes,    And don`t keep my commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then I will punish their sin with the rod,    And their iniquity with stripes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But I will not completely take my lovingkindness from him,    Nor allow my faithfulness to fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I will not break my covenant,    Nor alter what my lips have uttered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Once have I sworn by my holiness,    I will not lie to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>His seed will endure forever,    His throne like the sun before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>It will be established forever like the moon,    The faithful witness in the sky." Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But you have rejected and spurned.    You have been angry with your anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You have renounced the covenant of your servant.    You have defiled his crown in the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You have broken down all his hedges.    You have brought his strongholds to ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>All who pass by the way rob him. He has become a reproach to his neighbors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.    You have made all of his enemies rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword,    And haven`t supported him in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You have ended his splendor,    And thrown his throne down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You have shortened the days of his youth.    You have covered him with shame. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>How long, Yahweh?    Will you hide yourself forever?    Will your wrath burn like fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Remember how short my time is!    For what vanity have you created all the children of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>What man is he who shall live and not see death,    Who shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol? Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Lord, where are your former lovingkindnesses,    Which you swore to David in your faithfulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants,    How I bear in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh,    With which they have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Blessed be Yahweh forevermore. Amen, and Amen.     BOOK IV      Psalm 90       A Prayer by Moses, the man of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
