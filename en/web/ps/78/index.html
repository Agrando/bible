Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I will open my mouth in a parable.    I will utter dark sayings of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Which we have heard and known,    Our fathers have told us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>We will not hide them from their children,    Telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh,    His strength, and his wondrous works that he has done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For he established a testimony in Jacob,    And appointed a law in Israel,    Which he commanded our fathers,    That they should make them known to their children;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That the generation to come might know, even the children who       should be born;    Who should arise and tell their children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>That they might set their hope in God,    And not forget the works of God,    But keep his commandments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And might not be as their fathers,    A stubborn and rebellious generation,    A generation that didn`t make their hearts loyal,    Whose spirit was not steadfast with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,    Turned back in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They didn`t keep the covenant of God,    And refused to walk in his law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They forgot his doings,    His wondrous works that he had showed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Marvelous things did he in the sight of their fathers,    In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He split the sea, and caused them to pass through;    He made the waters stand as a heap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,    All the night with a light of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He split rocks in the wilderness,    And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He brought streams also out of the rock,    And caused waters to run down like rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet they still went on to sin against him,    To rebel against the Most High in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They tempted God in their heart    By asking food according to their desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yes, they spoke against God.    They said, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,    Streams overflowed. Can he give bread also?    Will he provide flesh for his people?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.    A fire was kindled against Jacob,    Anger also went up against Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because they didn`t believe in God,    And didn`t trust in his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet he commanded the skies above,    And opened the doors of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He rained down manna on them to eat,    And gave them food from the sky.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Man ate the bread of angels.    He sent them food to the full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.    By his power he guided the south wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He rained also flesh on them as the dust;    Winged birds as the sand of the seas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He let them fall in the midst of their camp,    Around their habitations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So they ate, and were well filled.    He gave them their own desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They didn`t turn from their cravings.    Their food was yet in their mouths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the anger of God went up against them,    And killed some of the fattest of them,    And struck down the young men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For all this they still sinned,    And didn`t believe in his wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,    And their years in terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>When he killed them, then they inquired after him.    They returned and sought God earnestly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They remembered that God was their rock,    The Most High God their redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But they flattered him with their mouth,    And lied to him with their tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For their heart was not right with him,    Neither were they faithful in his covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn`t destroy       them.    Yes, many times he turned his anger away,    And didn`t stir up all his wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He remembered that they were but flesh,    A wind that passes away, and doesn`t come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>How often did they rebel against him in the wilderness,    And grieve him in the desert!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They turned again and tempted God,    And provoked the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They didn`t remember his hand,    Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>How he set his signs in Egypt,    His wonders in the field of Zoan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Turned their rivers into blood,    Their streams, so that they could not drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;    Frogs, which destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,    Their labor to the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He destroyed their vines with hail,    Their sycamore-fig trees with frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He gave over their cattle also to the hail,    And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,    Wrath, indignation, and trouble,    And a band of angels of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He made a path for his anger.    He didn`t spare their soul from death,    But gave their life over to the pestilence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And struck all the firstborn in Egypt,    The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But he led forth his own people like sheep,    And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He led them safely, so that they weren`t afraid,    But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,    To this mountain, which his right hand had taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>He also drove out the nations before them,    Allotted them for an inheritance by line,    And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,    And didn`t keep his testimonies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.    They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For they provoked him to anger with their high places,    And moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>When God heard this, he was angry,    And greatly abhorred Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh,    The tent which he placed among men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And delivered his strength into captivity,    His glory into the adversary`s hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>He also gave his people over to the sword,    And was angry with his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Fire devoured their young men;    Their virgins had no wedding song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Their priests fell by the sword;    Their widows made no lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,    Like a mighty man who shouts by reason of wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>He struck his adversaries backward.    He put them to a perpetual reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,    And didn`t choose the tribe of Ephraim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But chose the tribe of Judah,    Mount Zion which he loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>He built his sanctuary like the heights,    Like the earth which he has established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>He also chose David his servant,    And took him from the sheepfolds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>From following the ewes that have their young he brought him    To be the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his       heart,    And guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.      Psalm 79       A Psalm by Asaph.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
