Let my cry come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Don`t hide your face from me in the day of my distress.    Turn your ear to me.    Answer me quickly in the day when I call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For my days consume away like smoke.    My bones are burned as a firebrand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart is blighted like grass, and withered,    For I forget to eat my bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>By reason of the voice of my groaning,    My bones stick to my skin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am like a pelican of the wilderness.    I have become as an owl of the waste places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone on the       housetop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My enemies reproach me all day.    Those who are mad at me use my name as a curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I have eaten ashes like bread,    And mingled my drink with tears,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because of your indignation and your wrath,    For you have taken me up, and thrown me away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My days are like a long shadow.    I have withered like grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But you, Yahweh, will abide forever;    Your renown endures to all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You will arise and have mercy on Zion;    For it is time to have pity on her.    Yes, the set time has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For your servants take pleasure in her stones,    And have pity on her dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the nations will fear the name of Yahweh;    All the kings of the earth your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Yahweh has built up Zion.    He has appeared in his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He has responded to the prayer of the destitute,    And has not despised their prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This will be written for the generation to come.    A people which will be created will praise Yah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.    From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To hear the groans of the prisoner;    To free those who are condemned to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That men may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion,    And his praise in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When the peoples are gathered together,    The kingdoms, to serve Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He weakened my strength along the course.    He shortened my days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said, "My God, don`t take me away in the midst of my days.    Your years are throughout all generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.    The heavens are the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They will perish, but you will endure.    Yes, all of them will wear out like a garment.    You will change them like a cloak, and they will be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But you are the same.    Your years will have no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The children of your servants will continue.    Their seed will be established before you."
