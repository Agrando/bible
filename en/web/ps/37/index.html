Dwell in the land, and enjoy safe pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Also delight yourself in Yahweh,    And he will give you the desires of your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Commit your way to Yahweh.    Trust also in him, and he will do this:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He will make your righteousness go forth as the light,    And your justice as the noon day sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him.    Don`t fret because of him who prospers in his way,    Because of the man who makes wicked plots happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath.    Don`t fret, it leads only to evildoing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evildoers shall be cut off,    But those who wait for Yahweh, they shall inherit the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For yet a little while, and the wicked will be no more.    Yes, though you look for his place, he isn`t there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the humble shall inherit the land,    And shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked plots against the just,    And gnashes at him with his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Lord will laugh at him,    For he sees that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,    To cast down the poor and needy,    To kill those who are upright in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their sword shall enter into their own heart.    Their bows shall be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is a little that the righteous has,    Than the abundance of many wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked shall be broken,    But Yahweh upholds the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yahweh knows the days of the perfect.    Their inheritance shall be forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They shall not be put to shame in the time of evil.    In the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked shall perish.    The enemies of Yahweh shall be like the beauty of the fields.    They will vanish --    Vanish like smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked borrow, and don`t pay back,    But the righteous give generously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For such as are blessed by him shall inherit the land.    Those who are cursed by him shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man`s goings are established by Yahweh.    He delights in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Though he stumble, he shall not fall,    For Yahweh holds him up with his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and now am old,    Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,    Nor his children begging for bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day long he deals graciously, and lends.    His seed is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Depart from evil, and do good;    Live securely forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For Yahweh loves justice,    And doesn`t forsake his saints.    They are preserved forever,    But the children of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous shall inherit the land,    And live in it forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom.    His tongue speaks justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The law of his God is in his heart.    None of his steps shall slide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wicked watches the righteous,    And seeks to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Yahweh will not leave him in his hand,    Nor condemn him when he is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way,    And he will exalt you to inherit the land.    When the wicked are cut off, you shall see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the wicked in great power,    Spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But he passed away, and, behold, he was not.    Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,    For there is a future for the man of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together.    The future of the wicked shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh.    He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Yahweh helps them, and rescues them.    He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them,    Because they have taken refuge in him.      Psalm 38  A Psalm by David, for a memorial.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
