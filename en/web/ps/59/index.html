Set me on high from those who rise up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Deliver me from the workers of iniquity.    Save me from the bloodthirsty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul.    The mighty gather themselves together against me,    Not for my disobedience, nor for my sin, Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have done no wrong, yet they are ready to attack me.    Rise up, behold, and help me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You, Yahweh God of hosts, the God of Israel,    Rouse yourself to punish the nations.    Show no mercy to the wicked traitors.

Swords are in their lips,    "For," they say, "who hears us?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you, Yahweh, laugh at them.    You scoff at all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Oh, my Strength, I watch for you,    For God is my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My God will go before me with his lovingkindness.    God will let me look at my enemies in triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Don`t kill them, or my people may forget.    Scatter them by your power, and bring them down, Lord our shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,    Let them be caught in their pride,    For the curses and lies which they utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Consume them in wrath.    Consume them, and they will be no more. Let them know that God rules in Jacob,    To the ends of the earth. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At evening let them return.    Let them howl like a dog, and go around the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They shall wander up and down for food,    And wait all night if they aren`t satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I will sing of your strength.    Yes, I will sing aloud of your lovingkindness in the morning.
