I will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I was mute with silence. I held my peace, even from good.    My sorrow was stirred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My heart was hot within me.    While I meditated, the fire burned: I spoke with my tongue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Yahweh, make me to know my end,    What is the measure of my days.    Let me know how frail I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, you have made my days handbreadths.    My lifetime is as nothing before you. Surely every man stands as a breath." Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>"Surely every man walks like a shadow.    Surely they busy themselves in vain. He heaps up, and doesn`t know who shall gather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, Lord, what do I wait for?    My hope is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Deliver me from all my transgressions.    Don`t make me the reproach of the foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was mute, I didn`t open my mouth,    Because you did it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Remove your scourge away from me.    I am overcome by the blow of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When you rebuke and correct man for iniquity,    You consume his wealth like a moth. Surely every man is but a breath." Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Hear my prayer, Yahweh, and give ear to my cry.    Don`t be silent at my tears. For I am a stranger with you,    A sojourner, as all my fathers were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,    Before I go away, and be no more."
