Never let me be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.    Turn your ear to me, and save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.    Give the command to save me,    For you are my rock and my fortress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked,    From the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh;    My confidence from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have relied on you from the womb.    You are he who took me out of my mother`s womb.    I will always praise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I am a marvel to many,    But you are my strong refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My mouth shall be filled with your praise,    With your honor all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Don`t reject me in my old age.    Don`t forsake me when my strength fails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For my enemies talk about me.    Those who watch for my soul conspire together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Saying, "God has forsaken him.    Pursue and take him, for no one will rescue him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>God, don`t be far from me.    My God, hurry to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let my accusers be put to shame and consumed.    Let them be covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I will always hope,    And will add to all of your praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My mouth will tell about your righteousness,    And of your salvation all day,    Though I don`t know its full measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh.    I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>God, you have taught me from my youth.    Until now, I have declared your wondrous works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes, even when I am old and gray-headed, God, don`t forsake me,    Until I have declared your strength to the next generation,    Your might to everyone who is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens;    You who have done great things. God, who is like you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You, who have showed us many and bitter troubles,    You will let me live.    You will bring us up again from the depths of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Increase my honor,    And comfort me again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my       God.    I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>My lips shall shout for joy!    My soul, which you have redeemed, sings praises to you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,    For they are put to shame, and they are confounded,    who want to harm me.
