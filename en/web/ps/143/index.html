Listen to my petitions.    In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Don`t enter into judgment with your servant,    For in your sight no man living is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For the enemy pursues my soul.    He has struck my life down to the ground.    He has made me live in dark places, as those who have been long dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me.
