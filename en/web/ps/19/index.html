The expanse shows his handiwork.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Day after day they pour forth speech,    And night after night they display knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>There is no speech nor language,    Where their voice is not heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their voice has gone out through all the earth,    Their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tent for the sun,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,    Like a strong man rejoicing to run his course.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>His going forth is from the end of the heavens,    His circuit to the ends of it;    There is nothing hid from the heat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The law of Yahweh is perfect, restoring the soul.    The testimony of Yahweh is sure, making wise the simple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The precepts of Yahweh are right, rejoicing the heart.    The commandment of Yahweh is pure, enlightening the eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The fear of Yahweh is clean, enduring forever.    The ordinances of Yahweh are true, and righteous altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold;    Sweeter also than honey and the extract of the honeycomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover by them is your servant warned.    In keeping them there is great reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who can discern his errors?    Forgive me from hidden errors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins.    Let them not have dominion over me. Then I will be upright,    I will be blameless and innocent of great transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart    Be acceptable in your sight,    Yahweh, my rock, and my redeemer.
