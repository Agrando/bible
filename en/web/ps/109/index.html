They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They have also surrounded me with words of hatred,    And fought against me without a cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In return for my love, they are my adversaries;    But I am in prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They have rewarded me evil for good,    And hatred for my love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Set a wicked man over him.    Let an adversary stand at his right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When he is judged, let him come forth guilty.    Let his prayer be turned into sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let his days be few.    Let another take his office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let his children be fatherless,    And his wife a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let his children be wandering beggars.    Let them be sought from their ruins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the creditor seize all that he has.    Let strangers plunder the fruit of his labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let there be none to extend kindness to him,    Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let his posterity be cut off.    In the generation following let their name be blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh.    Don`t let the sin of his mother be blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be before Yahweh continually,    That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because he didn`t remember to show kindness,    But persecuted the poor and needy man,    The broken in heart, to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.    He didn`t delight in blessing, and it was far from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.    It came into his inward parts like water,    Like oil into his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,    For the belt that is always around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh,    Of those who speak evil against my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord, for your name`s sake,    Because your lovingkindness is good, deliver me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I am poor and needy.    My heart is wounded within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I fade away like an evening shadow.    I am shaken off as the locust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>My knees are weak through fasting.    My body is thin and lacks fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have also become a reproach to them.    When they see me, they shake their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Help me, Yahweh, my God.    Save me according to your lovingkindness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That they may know that this is your hand;    That you, Yahweh, have done it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They may curse, but you bless.    When they arise, they will be put to shame,    But your servant shall rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.    Let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth.    Yes, I will praise him among the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,    To save him from those who judge his soul.      Psalm 110       A Psalm by David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
