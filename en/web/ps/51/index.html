According to the multitude of your tender mercies, blot out my       transgressions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity.    Cleanse me from my sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I know my transgressions.    My sin is constantly before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Against you, and you only, have I sinned,    And done that which is evil in your sight; That you may be proved right when you speak,    And justified when you judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity.    In sin did my mother conceive me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Behold, you desire truth in the inward parts.    You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean.    Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Let me hear joy and gladness,    That the bones which you have broken may rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Hide your face from my sins,    And blot out all of my iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Create in me a clean heart, God.    Renew a right spirit within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Don`t throw me away from your presence.    Don`t take your holy Spirit from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Restore to me the joy of your salvation.    Uphold me with a willing spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I will teach transgressors your ways.    Sinners shall be converted to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, God, you God of my salvation.    My tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Lord, open my lips.    My mouth shall declare your praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For you don`t delight in sacrifice, or else I would give it.    You have no pleasure in burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit.    A broken and contrite heart, God, you will not despise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Do well in your good pleasure to Zion.    Build the walls of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then will you delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,    In burnt offerings and in whole burnt offerings. Then they will offer bulls on your altar.      Psalm 52       For the Chief Musician.
