As a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My wounds are loathsome and corrupt,    Because of my foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am pained and bowed down greatly.    I go mourning all the day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For my loins are filled with burning.    There is no soundness in my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I am faint and severely bruised.    I have groaned by reason of the anguish of my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lord, all my desire is before you.    My groaning is not hidden from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My heart throbs. My strength fails me.    As for the light of my eyes, it also is gone from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague.    My kinsmen stand afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They also who seek after my life lay snares.    Those who seek my hurt speak mischievous things,    And meditate deceits all day long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I, as a deaf man, don`t hear.    I am as a mute man who doesn`t open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yes, I am as a man who doesn`t hear,    In whose mouth are no reproofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For in you, Yahweh, do I hope.    You will answer, Lord my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I said, "Don`t let them gloat over me,    Or exalt themselves over me when my foot slips."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I am ready to fall.    My pain is continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I will declare my iniquity.    I will be sorry for my sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But my enemies are vigorous and many.    Those who hate me without reason are numerous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They who also render evil for good are adversaries to me,    Because I follow what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Don`t forsake me, Yahweh.    My God, don`t be far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hurry to help me,    Lord, my salvation.      Psalm 39  For the Chief Musician. For Jeduthun.
