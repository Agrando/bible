Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,    Which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance;    Mount Zion, in which you have lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins,    All the evil that the enemy has done in the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly.    They have set up their standards as signs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They behaved like men wielding axes,    Cutting through a thicket of trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now all its carved work    They break down with hatchet and hammers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.    They have profaned the dwelling-place of your Name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They said in their heart, "We will crush them completely."    They have burned up all the places in the land where God was       worshipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We see no miraculous signs.    There is no longer any prophet,    Neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?    Shall the enemy blaspheme your name forever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?    Take it out of your pocket and consume them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet God is my King of old,    Working salvation in the midst of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You divided the sea by your strength.    You broke the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.    You gave him as food to people and desert creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You opened up spring and stream.    You dried up mighty rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The day is yours, the night is also yours.    You have prepared the light and the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You have set all the boundaries of the earth.    You have made summer and winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh.    Foolish people have blasphemed your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Don`t deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.    Don`t forget the life of your poor forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Honor your covenant,    For haunts of violence fill the dark places of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Don`t let the oppressed return ashamed.    Let the poor and needy praise your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Arise, God! Plead your own cause.    Remember how the foolish man mocks you all day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Don`t forget the voice of your adversaries.    The tumult of those who rise up against you ascends continually.      Psalm 75       For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "Do Not Destroy." A Psalm by Asaph. A song.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
