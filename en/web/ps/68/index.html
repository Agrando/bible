Let his enemies be scattered!    Let them who hate him also flee before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As smoke is driven away, so drive them away.    As wax melts before the fire,    So let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But let the righteous be glad.    Let them rejoice before God.
