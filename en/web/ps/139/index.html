You perceive my thoughts from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You search out my path and my lying down,    And are acquainted with all my ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For there is not a word on my tongue,    But, behold, Yahweh, you know it altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You hem me in behind and before.    You laid your hand on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This knowledge is beyond me.    It is lofty. I can`t attain it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Where could I go from your Spirit?    Or where could I flee from your presence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.    If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If I take the wings of the dawn,    And settle in the uttermost parts of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even there your hand will lead me,    And your right hand will hold me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me;    The light around me will be night;"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Even the darkness doesn`t hide from you,    But the night shines as the day.    The darkness is like light to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you formed my inmost being.    You knit me together in my mother`s womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will give thanks to you,    For I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful.    My soul knows that very well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My frame wasn`t hidden from you,    When I was made in secret,    Woven together in the depths of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Your eyes saw my body.    In your book they were all written,    The days that were ordained for me,    When as yet there were none of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How precious to me are your thoughts, God!    How vast is the sum of them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.    When I wake up, I am still with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If only you, God, would kill the wicked.    Get away from me, you bloodthirsty men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For they speak against you wickedly.    Your enemies take your name in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yahweh, don`t I hate those who hate you?    Am I not grieved with those who rise up against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I hate them with perfect hatred.    They have become my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Search me, God, and know my heart.    Try me, and know my thoughts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>See if there is any wicked way in me,    And lead me in the everlasting way.      Psalm 140  For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
