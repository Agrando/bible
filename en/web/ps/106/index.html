Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,    For his lovingkindness endures forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh,    Or fully declare all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed are those who keep justice,    He who does righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your       people.    Visit me with your salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That I may see the prosperity of your chosen,    That I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation,    That I may glory with your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers.    We have committed iniquity.    We have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers didn`t understand your wonders in Egypt.    They didn`t remember the multitude of your lovingkindnesses,    But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless he saved them for his name`s sake,    That he might make his mighty power known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;    So he led them through the depths, as through a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,    And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The waters covered their adversaries.    There was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they believed his words.    They sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They soon forgot his works.    They didn`t wait for his counsel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But gave in to craving in the desert,    And tested God in the wasteland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He gave them their request,    But sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They envied Moses also in the camp,    And Aaron, Yahweh`s saint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,    And covered the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A fire was kindled in their company.    The flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb,    And worshipped a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus they exchanged their glory    For an image of a bull that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot God, their Savior,    Who had done great things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wondrous works in the land of Ham,    And awesome things by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore he said that he would destroy them,    Had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in the breach,    To turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn`t destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, they despised the pleasant land.    They didn`t believe his word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But murmured in their tents,    And didn`t listen to the voice of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore he swore to them    That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That he would overthrow their seed among the nations,    And scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They joined themselves also to Baal-peor,    And ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.    The plague broke in on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment,    So the plague was stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>That was credited to him for righteousness,    To all generations forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,    So that Moses was troubled for their sakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because they were rebellious against his spirit,    He spoke rashly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They didn`t destroy the peoples,    As Yahweh commanded them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But mingled themselves with the nations,    Learned their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>They served their idols,    Which became a snare to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They shed innocent blood,    Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,    Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.    The land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus were they defiled with their works,    And prostituted themselves in their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was kindled against his people.    He abhorred his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He gave them into the hand of the nations.    Those who hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies also oppressed them.    They were brought into subjection under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times he delivered them,    But they were rebellious in their counsel,    And were brought low in their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless he regarded their distress,    When he heard their cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>He remembered for them his covenant,    And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He made them also to be pitied    By all those who carried them captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, Yahweh, our God,    Gather us from among the nations,    To give thanks to your holy name,    To triumph in your praise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,    From everlasting even to everlasting! Let all the people say, "Amen." Praise Yah!          BOOK V      Psalm 107</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
