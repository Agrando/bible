A fire devours before him.    It is very tempestuous around him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He calls to the heavens above,    To the earth, that he may judge his people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Gather my saints together to me,    Those who have made a covenant with me by sacrifice."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The heavens shall declare his righteousness,    For God himself is judge. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Hear, my people, and I will speak;    Israel, and I will testify against you. I am God, your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I don`t rebuke you for your sacrifices.    Your burnt offerings are continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have no need for a bull from your stall,    Nor male goats from your pens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For every animal of the forest is mine,    And the cattle on a thousand hills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I know all the birds of the mountains.    The wild animals of the field are mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I were hungry, I would not tell you,    For the world is mine, and all that is in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Will I eat the flesh of bulls,    Or drink the blood of goats?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Offer to God the sacrifice of thanksgiving.    Pay your vows to the Most High.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Call on me in the day of trouble.    I will deliver you, and you will honor me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to the wicked God says,    "What right do you have to declare my statutes,    That you have taken my covenant on your lips,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Seeing you hate instruction,    And throw my words behind you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When you saw a thief, you consented with him,    And have participated with adulterers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>"You give your mouth to evil.    Your tongue harnesses deceit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You sit and speak against your brother.    You slander your own mother`s son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have done these things, and I kept silence.    You thought that the "I AM" was just like you.    I will rebuke you, and accuse you in front of your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Now consider this, you who forget God,    Lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whoever offers the sacrifice of thanksgiving glorifies me,    And prepares his way so that I will show God`s salvation to him."      Psalm 51       For the Chief Musician. A Psalm by David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
