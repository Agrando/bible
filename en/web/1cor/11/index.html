For it is one and the same thing as if she were shaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For if a woman is not covered, let her also be shorn. But if it is shameful for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a man indeed ought not to have his head covered, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For man is not from woman, but woman from man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for neither was man created for the woman, but woman for the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this cause the woman ought to have authority on her head, because of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless, neither is the woman independent of the man, nor the man independent of the woman, in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as the woman is from the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Judge for yourselves. Is it appropriate that a woman pray to God unveiled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Doesn`t even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, for her hair is given to her for a covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if any man seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither do God`s assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But in giving you this command, I don`t praise you, that you come together not for the better but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For first of all, when you come together in the assembly, I hear that divisions exist among you, and I partly believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For there must be also factions among you, that those who are approved may be revealed among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When therefore you assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord`s supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For in your eating each one takes his own supper before others. One is hungry, and another is drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What, don`t you have houses to eat and to drink in? Or do you despise God`s assembly, and put them to shame who don`t have? What will I tell you? Will I praise you? In this I don`t praise you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "Take, eat. This is my body, which is broken for you. Do this in memory of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way he also took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink, in memory of me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord`s death until he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks the Lord`s cup in an unworthy manner, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he doesn`t discern the Lord`s body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we discerned ourselves, we wouldn`t be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged, we are punished by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that your coming together may not be to judgment. The rest I will set in order whenever I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
