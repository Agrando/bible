that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn`t run in vain nor labor in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
