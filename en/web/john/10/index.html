He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don`t know the voice of strangers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn`t understand what he was telling them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus therefore said to them again, "Most assuredly, I tell you, I am the sheep`s door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn`t listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy. I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn`t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn`t care for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I`m known by my own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I have other sheep, which are not of this fold. I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down by myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. I received this commandment from my Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore a division arose again among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Many of them said, "He has a demon, and is mad! Why do you listen to him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, "These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple, in Solomon`s porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Jews therefore came around him and said to him, "How long will you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, "I told you, and you don`t believe. The works that I do in my Father`s name, these testify about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you don`t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I give eternal life to them. They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all. No one is able to snatch them out of my Father`s hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore Jews took up stones again to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, "I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, "We don`t stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy: because you, being a man, make yourself God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, "Isn`t it written in your law, `I said, you are gods?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the scripture can`t be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, `You blaspheme,` because I said, `I am the Son of God?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I don`t do the works of my Father, don`t believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do them, though you don`t believe me, believe the works; that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They sought again to seize him, and he went forth out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing, and there he stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Many came to him. They said, "John indeed did no sign, but everything whatever that John said about this man is true."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Many believed in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
