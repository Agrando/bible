But, that the works of God might be revealed in him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. The night is coming, when no one can work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When he had said this, he spat on the ground, made mud with the saliva, anointed the blind man`s eyes with the mud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means "Sent"). So he went away, washed, and came seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbors therefore, and those who saw that he was blind, before, said, "Isn`t this he who sat and begged?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Others said, "It is he." Still others said, "He is like him."     He said, "I am he."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They said therefore to him, "How were your eyes opened?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, "A man called Jesus made mud, anointed my eyes, and said to me, "Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash." So I went away and washed, and I received sight."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they asked him, "Where is he?"     He said, "I don`t know."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought him who before was blind to the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It was a Sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. He said to them, "He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and I see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, because he doesn`t keep the Sabbath." Others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore they asked the blind man again, "What do you say about him, in that he opened your eyes?"     He said, "He is a prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered them, "We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but how he now sees, we don`t know; or who opened his eyes, we don`t know. He is of age. Ask him. He will speak for himself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>His parents said these things because they feared the Jews; for the Jews had already agreed that if any man would confess him as Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they called the man who was blind a second time, and said to him, "Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He therefore answered, "I don`t know if he is a sinner. One thing I know: that though I was blind, now I see."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said to him again, "What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them, "I told you already, and you didn`t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They became abusive towards him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God has spoken to Moses. But as for this man, we don`t know where he comes from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered them, "How amazing! You don`t know where he comes from, yet he opened my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God doesn`t listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and does his will, he listens to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Since the world began it has never been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered him, "You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us?" They threw him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, "Do you believe in the Son of God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said, "Lord, I believe!" and he worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, "I came into this world for judgment, that those who don`t see may see; and that those who see may become blind."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, "Are we also blind?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, "If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, `We see.` Therefore your sin remains.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
