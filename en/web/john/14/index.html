Believe in God. Believe also in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In my Father`s house are many mansions. If it weren`t so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will receive you to myself; that where I am, you may be there also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Where I go, you know, and you know the way."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thomas says to him, "Lord, we don`t know where you are going. How can we know the way?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, but by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you had known me, you would have known my Father also. From now on, you know him, and have seen him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jesus said to him, "Have I been with you such a long time, and do you not know me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, `Show us the Father?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Don`t you believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I tell you, I speak not from myself; but the Father living in me does his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for the very works` sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Most assuredly I tell you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, he will do also; and greater works than these will he do; because I am going to my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whatever you will ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you will ask anything in my name, that will I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If you love me, keep my commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will pray to the Father, and he will give you another Counselor, that he may be with you forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>-- the Spirit of truth, whom the world can`t receive; for it doesn`t see him, neither knows him. You know him, for he lives with you, and will be in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet a little while, and the world will see me no more; but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Someone who has my commandments, and keeps them, that person is one who loves me. One who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will reveal myself to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Judas (not Iscariot) said to him, "Lord, what will happen that you will reveal yourself to us, and not to the world?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him, "If a man loves me, he will keep my word. My Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He who doesn`t love me doesn`t keep my words. The word which you hear isn`t mine, but the Father`s who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have said these things to you, while still living with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your memory all that I said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you; not as the world gives, give I to you. Don`t let your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You heard how I told you, `I go away, and I come to you.` If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I said `I am going to my Father;` for the Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now I have told you before it happens so that, when it happens, you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world comes, and he has nothing in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
