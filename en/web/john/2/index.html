Jesus` mother was there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, to the marriage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When the wine ran out, Jesus` Mother said to him, "They have no wine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jesus said to her, "Woman, what does that have to do with you and me? My hour has not yet come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother said to the servants, "Whatever he says to you, do it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were six water pots of stone set there after the Jews` manner of purifying, containing two or three metretes apiece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to them, "Fill the water pots with water." They filled them up to the brim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the ruler of the feast." They took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and didn`t know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast called the bridegroom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said to him, "Everyone serves the good wine first, and when the guests have drunk freely, then that which is worse. You have kept the good wine until now!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This beginning of his signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory. His disciples believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After this, he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and there they stayed not many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He found in the temple those who sold oxen, sheep, and doves, and the changers of money sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He made a whip of cords, and threw all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers` money, and overthrew their tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To those who sold the doves, he said, "Take these things out of here! Don`t make my Father`s house a marketplace!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will eat me up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews therefore answered him, "What sign do you show to us, seeing that you do these things?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jews therefore said, "Forty-six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in his name, observing his signs which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jesus didn`t trust himself to them, because he knew all people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and because he didn`t need for anyone to testify concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
