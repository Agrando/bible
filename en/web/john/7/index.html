If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even his brothers didn`t believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus therefore said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world can`t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, "Where is he?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, "He is a good man." Others said, "Not so, but he leads the multitude astray."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, "How does this man know letters, having never been educated?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus therefore answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone desires to do his will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I speak from myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Didn`t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The multitude answered, "You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered them, "I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Don`t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, "Isn`t this he whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, "You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don`t know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They sought therefore to take him. No one laid a hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, "When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than those which this man has done?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus said, "Yet a little while, am I with you, then I go to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You will seek me, and won`t find me; and where I am, you can`t come."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews therefore said among themselves, "Where will this man go that we won`t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What is this word that he said, `You will seek me, and won`t find me; and where I am, you can`t come?`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn`t yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, "This is truly the prophet."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Hasn`t the scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Some of them would have taken him, but no one laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, "Why didn`t you bring him?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees therefore answered them, "Are you also led astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Has any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this cursed multitude doesn`t know the law."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>"Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered him, "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Everyone went to his own house,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
