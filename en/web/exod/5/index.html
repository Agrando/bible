I don`t know Yahweh, and moreover I will not let Israel go."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go three days` journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us with pestilence, or with the sword."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The king of Egypt said to them, "Why do you, Moses and Aaron, take the people from their work? Get back to your burdens!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you make them rest from their burdens."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require from them. You shall not diminish anything of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, `Let us go and sacrifice to our God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein; and don`t let them pay any attention to lying words."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, This is what Pharaoh says: "I will not give you straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing of your work shall be diminished."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The taskmasters were urgent saying, "Fulfill your work quota daily, as when there was straw!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh`s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, "Why haven`t you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today, in making brick as before?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us, `Make brick!` and, behold, your servants are beaten; but the fault is in your own people."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he said, "You are idle! You are idle! Therefore you say, `Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you, yet shall you deliver the same number of bricks!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in trouble, when it was said, "You shall not diminish anything from your daily quota of bricks!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they said to them, "May Yahweh look at you, and judge, because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Lord, why have you brought trouble on this people? Why is it that you have sent me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered your people at all."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
