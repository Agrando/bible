It is mine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Moses said to the people, "Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place. No leavened bread shall be eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>This day you go forth in the month Abib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this service in this month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be yeast seen with you, in all your borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You shall tell your son in that day, saying, `It is because of that which Yahweh did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial between your eyes, that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth; for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>"It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and shall give it you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb, and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal.
