Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever." Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and be ready against the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, `Be careful that you don`t go up onto the mountain, or touch its border. Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.` When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to the people, "Be ready by the third day. Don`t have sexual relations with a woman."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the lower part of the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yahweh said to Moses, "Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, lest Yahweh break forth on them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moses said to Yahweh, "The people can`t come up to Mount Sinai, for you charged us, saying, `Set bounds around the mountain, and sanctify it.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yahweh said to him, "Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you, but  don`t let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he break forth on them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses went down to the people, and told them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
