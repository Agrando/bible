on whom, though now you don`t see him, yet believing, you rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Concerning this salvation, the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that would come to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>searching for what or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ, which was in them, pointed to, when he testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you, did they minister these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, prepare your minds for action, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ --</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as children of obedience, not conforming yourselves according to your former lusts as in your ignorance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but just as he who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all of your behavior;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because it is written, "You shall be holy; for I am holy."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man`s work, pass the time of your living as strangers here in reverent fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>knowing that you were redeemed, not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from the useless way of life handed down from your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with precious blood, as of a lamb without spot, the blood of Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was revealed at the end of times for your sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your faith and hope might be in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seeing you have purified your souls in your obedience to the truth through the Spirit in sincere brotherly affection, love one another from the heart fervently:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>having been born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and remains forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, "All flesh is like grass, And all of man`s glory like the flower in the grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the Lord`s word endures forever."     This is the word of good news which was preached to you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
