For they stumble at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also they were appointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God`s own possession, that you may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who in time past were no people, but now are the people of God, who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lust, which war against the soul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>having good behavior among the nations, so in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they see, glorify God in the day of visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore subject yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord`s sake: whether to the king, as supreme;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>or to governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to those who do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For so is the will of God, that by well-doing you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is commendable if someone endures pain, suffering unjustly, because of conscience toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what glory is it, if, when you sin, you patiently endure beating? But if, when you do well, you patiently endure suffering, this is commendable with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to this were you called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who did not sin, "neither was deceit found in his mouth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who, when he was reviled, didn`t revile back. When he suffered, didn`t threaten, but committed himself to him who judges righteously;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who his own self bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live to righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were going astray like sheep; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
