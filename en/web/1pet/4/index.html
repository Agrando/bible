Therefore be of sound mind, self-controlled, and sober in prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And above all things be earnest in your love among yourselves, for love covers a multitude of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be hospitable one to another without grumbling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According as each has received a gift, be ministering it among yourselves, as good stewards of the grace of God in its various forms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If any man speaks, let it be as it were oracles of God. If any man serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, whose is the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Beloved, don`t be astonished at the fiery trial which has come upon you, to test you, as though a strange thing happened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But because you are partakers of Christ`s sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also you may rejoice with exceeding joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you are insulted for the name of Christ, blessed are you; because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you. On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or as a meddler in other men`s matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the time [has come] for judgment to begin at the house of God. If it begins first at us, what will happen to those who don`t obey the gospel of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and the sinner?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore let them also who suffer according to the will of God in doing good entrust their souls to him, as to a faithful Creator.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
