He has also set eternity in their hearts, yet so that man can`t find out the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice, and to do good as long as they live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know that whatever God does, it shall be forever. Nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it; and God has done it, that men should fear before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That which is has been long ago, and that which is to be has been long ago: and God seeks again that which is passed away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I said in my heart, "God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I said in my heart, "As for the sons of men, God tests them, so that they may see that they themselves are like animals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they have all one breath; and man has no advantage over the animals: for all is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All go to one place.
