Not only idle, but also gossips and busybodies, saying things which they ought not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For already some have turned aside after Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any man or woman who believes has widows, let them relieve them, and don`t let the assembly be burdened; that it might relieve those who are widows indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain." And, "The laborer is worthy of his wages."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Don`t receive an accusation against an elder, except at the word of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Those who sin, reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other men`s sins. Keep yourself pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine for your stomach`s sake and your frequent infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some men`s sins are evident, going before to judgment, and some men also they follow after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In the same way also there are good works that are obvious, and those that are otherwise can`t be hidden.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
