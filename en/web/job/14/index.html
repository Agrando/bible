He also flees like a shadow, and doesn`t continue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Do you open your eyes on such a one,    And bring me into judgment with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?    Not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Seeing his days are determined,    The number of his months is with you,    And you have appointed his bounds that he can`t pass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Look away from him, that he may rest,    Until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"For there is hope for a tree,    If it is cut down, that it will sprout again,    That the tender branch of it will not cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though the root of it grows old in the earth,    And the stock of it dies in the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yet through the scent of water it will bud,    And put forth boughs like a plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But man dies, and is laid low.    Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As the waters fail from the sea,    And the river wastes and dries up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So man lies down and doesn`t rise;    Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake,    Nor be roused out of their sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Oh that you would hide me in Sheol,    That you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past,    That you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a man dies, shall he live again?    All the days of my warfare would I wait,    Until my release should come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You would call, and I would answer you.    You would have a desire to the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you number my steps.    Don`t you watch over my sin?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My disobedience is sealed up in a bag.    You fasten up my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"But the mountain falling comes to nothing;    The rock is removed out of its place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The waters wear the stones;    The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth:    So you destroy the hope of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You forever prevail against him, and he passes;    You change his face, and send him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His sons come to honor, and he doesn`t know it;    They are brought low, but he doesn`t perceive it of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his flesh on him has pain;    His soul within him mourns."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
