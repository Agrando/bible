They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They pluck salt herbs by the bushes.     The roots of the broom are their food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are driven forth from the midst of men;    They cry after them as after a thief;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So that they dwell in frightful valleys,    And in holes of the earth and of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Among the bushes they bray;    And under the nettles they are gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They are children of fools, yes, children of base men.    They were flogged out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"Now I have become their song.    Yes, I am a byword to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They abhor me, they stand aloof from me,    And don`t hesitate to spit in my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he has loosed his cord, and afflicted me;    And they have thrown off restraint before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On my right hand rise the rabble.    They thrust aside my feet,    They cast up against me their ways of destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They mar my path,    They set forward my calamity,    Without anyone`s help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As through a wide breach they come,    In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Terrors are turned on me.    They chase my honor as the wind.    My welfare has passed away as a cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"Now my soul is poured out within me.    Days of affliction have taken hold on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the night season my bones are pierced in me,    And the pains that gnaw me take no rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By great force is my garment disfigured.    It binds me about as the collar of my coat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He has cast me into the mire.    I have become like dust and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I cry to you, and you do not answer me.    I stand up, and you gaze at me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have turned to be cruel to me.    With the might of your hand you persecute me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it.    You dissolve me in the storm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I know that you will bring me to death,    To the house appointed for all living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"However doesn`t one stretch out a hand in his fall?    Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Didn`t I weep for him who was in trouble?    Wasn`t my soul grieved for the needy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I looked for good, then evil came;    When I waited for light, there came darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My heart is troubled, and doesn`t rest.     Days of affliction have come on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I go mourning without the sun.    I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I am a brother to jackals,    And a companion to ostriches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>My skin grows black and peels from me.    My bones are burned with heat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore is my harp turned to mourning,    And my pipe into the voice of those who weep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
