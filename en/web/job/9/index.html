He passes on also, but I don`t perceive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, he snatches away; who can hinder him?    Who will ask him, `What are you doing?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"God will not withdraw his anger;    The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How much less shall I answer him,    Choose my words to argue with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer.    I would make supplication to my judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If I had called, and he had answered me,    Yet would I not believe that he listened to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he breaks me with a tempest,    Multiplies my wounds without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He will not allow me to take my breath,    But fills me with bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty!    If of justice, `Who,` says he, `will summon me?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me.    Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I am blameless. I don`t regard myself.    I despise my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"It is all the same. Therefore I say,    He destroys the blameless and the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If the scourge kills suddenly,    He will mock at the trial of the innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.    He covers the faces of the judges of it.    If not he, then who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>"Now my days are swifter than a runner.    They flee away, they see no good,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They have passed away as the swift ships,    As the eagle that swoops on the prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If I say, `I will forget my complaint,    I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I am afraid of all my sorrows,    I know that you will not hold me innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I shall be condemned;    Why then do I labor in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I wash myself with snow,    And cleanse my hands with lye,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet you will plunge me in the ditch.    My own clothes shall abhor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,    That we should come together in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>There is no umpire between us,    That might lay his hand on us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let him take his rod away from me,    Let his terror not make me afraid:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then I would speak, and not fear him,    For I am not so in myself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
