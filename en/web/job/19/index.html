You aren`t ashamed that you attack me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If it is true that I have erred,    My error remains with myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me,    And plead against me my reproach;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Know now that God has subverted me,    And has surrounded me with his net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:    I cry for help, but there is no justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He has walled up my way so that I can`t pass,    And has set darkness in my paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He has stripped me of my glory,    And taken the crown from my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone.    My hope he has plucked up like a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He has also kindled his wrath against me.    He counts me among his adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His troops come on together,    Build a siege ramp against me,    And encamp around my tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"He has put my brothers far from me.    My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My relatives have gone away.    My familiar friends have forgotten me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a       stranger.    I am an alien in their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer;    I beg him with my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My breath is offensive to my wife.    I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even young children despise me.    If I arise, they speak against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All my familiar friends abhor me.    They whom I loved have turned against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh.    I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends;    For the hand of God has touched me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Why do you persecute me as God,    And are not satisfied with my flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>"Oh that my words were now written!    Oh that they were inscribed in a book!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That with an iron pen and lead    They were engraved in the rock forever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives.    In the end, he will stand upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>After my skin is destroyed,    Then in my flesh shall I see God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whom I, even I, shall see on my side.    My eyes shall see, and not as a stranger.  "My heart is consumed within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If you say, `How we will persecute him!`    Because the root of the matter is found in me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Be afraid of the sword,    For wrath brings the punishments of the sword,    That you may know there is a judgment."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
