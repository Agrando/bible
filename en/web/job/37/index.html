He thunders with the voice of his majesty;    He doesn`t hold back anything when his voice is heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>God thunders marvelously with his voice.    He does great things, which we can`t comprehend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For he says to the snow, `Fall on the earth;`    Likewise to the shower of rain,    And to the showers of his mighty rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He seals up the hand of every man,    That all men whom he has made may know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the animals go into coverts,    And remain in their dens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Out of its chamber comes the storm,    And cold out of the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By the breath of God, ice is given,    And the breadth of the waters is frozen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture.    He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is turned round about by his guidance,    That they may do whatever he commands them    On the surface of the habitable world,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whether it is for correction, or for his land,    Or for lovingkindness, that he causes it to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Listen to this, Job:    Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Do you know how God controls them,    And causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do you know the workings of the clouds,    The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You whose clothing is warm,    When the earth is still by reason of the south wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Can you, with him, spread out the sky,    Which is strong as a cast metal mirror?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Teach us what we shall tell him;    For we can`t make our case by reason of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall it be told him that I would speak?    Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now men don`t see the light which is bright in the skies,    But the wind passes, and clears them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Out of the north comes golden splendor;    With God is awesome majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>We can`t reach the Almighty,    He is exalted in power;    In justice and great righteousness he will not oppress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore men revere him.    He doesn`t regard any who are wise of heart."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
