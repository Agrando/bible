Let us know among ourselves what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For Job has said, `I am righteous,    God has taken away my right:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar;    My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What man is like Job,    Who drinks up scoffing like water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity,    And walks with wicked men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he has said, `It profits a man nothing    That he should delight himself with God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding:    Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness,    From the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the work of a man will he render to him,    And cause every man to find according to his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yes surely, God will not do wickedly,    Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who gave him a charge over the earth?    Or who has appointed him over the whole world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If he set his heart on himself,    If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All flesh would perish together,    And man would turn again to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"If now you have understanding, hear this.    Listen to the voice of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall even one who hates justice govern?    Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who says to a king, `Vile!`    Or to nobles, `Wicked!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who doesn`t respect the persons of princes,    Nor regards the rich more than the poor;    For they all are the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment they die, even at midnight;    The people are shaken and pass away,    The mighty are taken away without hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"For his eyes are on the ways of a man,    He sees all his goings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,    Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he doesn`t need to consider a man further,    That he should go before God in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,    And sets others in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he takes knowledge of their works.    He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He strikes them as wicked men    In the open sight of others;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because they turned aside from following him,    And wouldn`t have regard in any of his ways:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him,    He heard the cry of the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he gives quietness, who then can condemn?    When he hides his face, who then can see him?    Alike whether to a nation, or to a man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That the godless man may not reign,    That there be no one to ensnare the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>"For has any said to God,    `I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Teach me that which I don`t see.    If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more`?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?    For you must choose, and not I.    Therefore speak what you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Men of understanding will tell me,    Yes, every wise man who hears me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>`Job speaks without knowledge,    His words are without wisdom.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I wish that Job were tried to the end,    Because of his answering like wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he adds rebellion to his sin.    He claps his hands among us,    And multiplies his words against God."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
