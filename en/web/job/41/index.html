Or press down his tongue with a cord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Can you put a rope into his nose?    Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Will he make many petitions to you?    Or will he speak soft words to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will he make a covenant with you,    That you should take him for a servant forever?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Will you play with him as with a bird?    Or will you bind him for your girls?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Will traders barter for him?    Will they part him among the merchants?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Can you fill his skin with barbed irons,    Or his head with fish-spears?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Lay your hand on him.    Remember the battle, and do so no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Behold, the hope of him is in vain.    Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>None is so fierce that he dare stir him up.    Who then is he who can stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Who has first given to me, that I should repay him?    Everything under the heavens is mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,    Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who can strip off his outer garment?    Who shall come within his jaws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who can open the doors of his face?    Around his teeth is terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Strong scales are his pride,    Shut up together with a close seal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>One is so near to another,    That no air can come between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are joined one to another;    They stick together, so that they can`t be pulled apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His sneezing flashes forth light,    His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Out of his mouth go burning torches,    Sparks of fire leap forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Out of his nostrils a smoke goes,    As of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His breath kindles coals.    A flame goes forth from his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In his neck there is strength.    Terror dances before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The flakes of his flesh are joined together.    They are firm on him. They can`t be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His heart is as firm as a stone,    Yes, firm as the lower millstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid.    They retreat before his thrashing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If one lay at him with the sword, it can`t avail;    Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He counts iron as straw;    And brass as rotten wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The arrow can`t make him flee.    Sling stones are like chaff to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Clubs are counted as stubble.    He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>His undersides are like sharp potsherds,    Leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He makes the deep to boil like a pot.    He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He makes a path to shine after him.    One would think the deep had white hair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>On earth there is not his equal,    That is made without fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He sees everything that is high:    He is king over all the sons of pride."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
