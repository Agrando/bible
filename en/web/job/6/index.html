The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My soul refuses to touch them; They are as loathsome food to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"Oh that I might have my request;    That God would grant the thing that I long for!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Even that it would please God to crush me;    That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be it still my consolation,    Yes, let me exult in pain that doesn`t spare,    That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What is my strength, that I should wait?    What is my end, that I should be patient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is my strength the strength of stones?    Or is my flesh of brass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Isn`t it that I have no help in me,    That wisdom is driven quite from me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his       friend;    Even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook,    As the channel of brooks that pass away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Which are black by reason of the ice,    in which the snow hides itself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In the dry season, they vanish.    When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The caravans that travel beside them turn aside;    They go up into the waste, and perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The caravans of Tema looked,    The companies of Sheba waited for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They were put to shame because they had hoped;    They came there, and were confounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For now you are nothing.
