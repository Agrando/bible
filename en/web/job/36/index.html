One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>"Behold, God is mighty, and doesn`t despise anyone.    He is mighty in strength of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He doesn`t preserve the life of the wicked,    But gives to the afflicted their right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He doesn`t withdraw his eyes from the righteous,    But with kings on the throne,    He sets them forever, and they are exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If they are bound in fetters,    And are taken in the cords of afflictions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he shows them their work,    And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He also opens their ears to instruction,    And commands that they return from iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If they listen and serve him,    They shall spend their days in prosperity,    And their years in pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if they don`t listen, they shall perish by the sword;    They shall die without knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"But those who are godless in heart lay up anger.    They don`t cry for help when he binds them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They die in youth.    Their life perishes among the unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He delivers the afflicted by their affliction,    And opens their ear in oppression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yes, he would have allured you out of distress,    Into a broad place, where there is no restriction.    That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"But you are full of the judgment of the wicked.    Judgment and justice take hold of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Don`t let riches entice you to wrath,    Neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Would your wealth sustain you in distress,    Or all the might of your strength?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Don`t desire the night,    When people are cut off in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Take heed, don`t regard iniquity;    For this you have chosen rather than affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, God is exalted in his power.    Who is a teacher like him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who has prescribed his way for him?    Or who can say, `You have committed unrighteousness?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>"Remember that you magnify his work,    Whereof men have sung.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>All men have looked thereon.    Man sees it afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold, God is great, and we don`t know him.    The number of his years is unsearchable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For he draws up the drops of water,    Which distill in rain from his vapor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Which the skies pour down    And drop on man abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds,    And the thunderings of his pavilion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Behold, he spreads his light around him.    He covers the bottom of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For by these he judges the people.    He gives food in abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He covers his hands with the lightning,    And commands it to strike the mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The noise of it tells about him,    And the cattle also concerning the storm that comes up.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
