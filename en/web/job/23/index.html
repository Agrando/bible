His hand is heavy in spite of my groaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Oh that I knew where I might find him!    That I might come even to his seat!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I would set my cause in order before him,    And fill my mouth with arguments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I would know the words which he would answer me,    And understand what he would tell me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power?    No, but he would listen to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There the upright might reason with him,    So I should be delivered forever from my judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"If I go east, he is not there;    If west, I can`t find him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He works to the north, but I can`t see him;    He turns south, but I can`t catch a glimpse of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But he knows the way that I take.    When he has tried me, I shall come forth like gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My foot has held fast to his steps.    His way have I kept, and not turned aside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I haven`t gone back from the commandment of his lips.    I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary       food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he stands alone, and who can oppose him?    What his soul desires, even that he does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For he performs that which is appointed for me.    Many such things are with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore I am terrified at his presence.    When I consider, I am afraid of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For God has made my heart faint.    The Almighty has terrified me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because I was not cut off before the darkness,    Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
