He who argues with God, let him answer it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Job answered Yahweh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>"Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer you?    I lay my hand on my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have spoken once, and I will not answer;    Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Now brace yourself like a man.    I will question you, and you will answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will you even annul my judgment?    Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or have you an arm like God?    Can you thunder with a voice like him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>"Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity.    Array yourself with honor and majesty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Pour forth the fury of your anger.    Look on everyone who is proud, and bring him low.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Look on everyone who is proud, and humble him.    Crush the wicked in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Hide them in the dust together.    Bind their faces in the hidden place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I will also admit to you    That your own right hand can save you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you.    He eats grass as an ox.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Look now, his strength is in his loins,    His force is in the muscles of his belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He moves his tail like a cedar:    The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>His bones are like tubes of brass.    His limbs are like bars of iron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He is the chief of the ways of God.    He who made him gives him his sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely the mountains bring him forth food,    Where all the animals of the field do play.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He lies under the lotus-trees,    In the covert of the reed, and the marsh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The lotuses cover him with their shade.    The willows of the brook surround him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn`t tremble.    He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shall any take him when he is on the watch,    Or pierce through his nose with a snare?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
