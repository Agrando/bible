Let this be your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Allow me, and I also will speak;    After I have spoken, mock on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>As for me, is my complaint to man?    Why shouldn`t I be impatient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Look at me, and be astonished.     Lay your hand on your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When I remember, I am troubled.    Horror takes hold of my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Why do the wicked live,    Become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their child is established with them in their sight,    Their offspring before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their houses are safe from fear,    Neither is the rod of God upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Their bulls breed without fail.    Their cows calve, and don`t miscarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They send forth their little ones like a flock.    Their children dance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They sing to the tambourine and harp,    And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They spend their days in prosperity.    In an instant they go down to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They tell God, `Depart from us,    For we don`t want to know about your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?    What profit should we have, if we pray to him?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand:    The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>"How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?    That their calamity comes on them?    That God distributes sorrows in his anger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That they are as stubble before the wind,    As chaff that the storm carries away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You say, `God lays up his iniquity for his children.`    Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let his own eyes see his destruction.    Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For what does he care for his house after him,    When the number of his months is cut off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"Shall any teach God knowledge,    Seeing he judges those who are high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One dies in his full strength,    Being wholly at ease and quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>His pails are full of milk.    The marrow of his bones is moistened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Another dies in bitterness of soul,    And never tastes of good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They lie down alike in the dust,    The worm covers them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>"Behold, I know your thoughts,    The devices with which you would wrong me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For you say, `Where is the house of the prince?    Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Haven`t you asked wayfaring men?    Don`t you know their evidences,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity?    That they are led forth to the day of wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Who shall declare his way to his face?    Who shall repay him what he has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet shall he be borne to the grave,    Men shall keep watch over the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him.    All men shall draw after him,    As there were innumerable before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So how can you comfort me with nonsense,    Seeing that in your answers there remains only falsehood?"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
