Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous?    Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Is it for your piety that he reproves you,    That he enters with you into judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Isn`t your wickedness great?    Neither is there any end to your iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing,    And stripped the naked of their clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You haven`t given water to the weary to drink,    And you have withheld bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But as for the mighty man, he had the earth.    The honorable man, he lived in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You have sent widows away empty,    And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore snares are round about you.    Sudden fear troubles you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Or darkness, so that you can not see,    And floods of waters cover you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"Isn`t God in the heights of heaven?    See the height of the stars, how high they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You say, `What does God know?    Can he judge through the thick darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn`t see.    He walks on the vault of the sky.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Will you keep the old way    Which wicked men have trodden,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were snatched away before their time,    Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Who said to God, `Depart from us;`    And, `What can the Almighty do for us?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet he filled their houses with good things,    But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The righteous see it, and are glad;    The innocent laugh them to scorn,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Saying, `Surely those who rose up against us are cut off,    The fire has consumed the remnant of them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>"Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace.    Thereby good shall come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Please receive the law from his mouth,    And lay up his words in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up,    If you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Lay your treasure in the dust,    The gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The Almighty will be your treasure,    Precious silver to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For then shall you delight yourself in the Almighty,    And shall lift up your face to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you.    You shall pay your vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to       you.    Light shall shine on your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they cast down, you shall say, `be lifted up.`    He will save the humble person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He will even deliver him who is not innocent;    Yes, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
