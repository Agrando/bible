My justice was as a robe and a diadem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I was eyes to the blind,    And feet to the lame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I was a father to the needy.

Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I smiled on them when they had no confidence.    They didn`t reject the light of my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I chose out their way, and sat as chief.    I lived as a king in the army,    As one who comforts the mourners.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
