Should a man full of talk be justified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Should your boastings make men hold their peace?    When you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For you say, `My doctrine is pure,    I am clean in your eyes.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But oh that God would speak,    And open his lips against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>That he would show you the secrets of wisdom!    For true wisdom has two sides.    Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity       deserves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>"Can you fathom the mystery of God?    Or can you probe the limits of the Almighty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They are high as heaven. What can you do?    Deeper than Sheol: what can you know?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The measure of it is longer than the earth,    And broader than the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If he passes by, or confines,    Or convenes a court, then who can oppose him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knows false men.    He sees iniquity also, even though he doesn`t consider it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But vain man can become wise    If a man can be born as a wild donkey`s colt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"If you set your heart aright,    Stretch out your hands toward him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away,    Don`t let unrighteousness dwell in your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Surely then shall you lift up your face without spot;    Yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For you shall forget your misery;    You shall remember it as waters that are passed away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Life shall be clearer than the noonday;     Though there is darkness, it shall be as the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall be secure, because there is hope;    Yes, you shall search, and shall take your rest in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid;    Yes, many shall court your favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the eyes of the wicked shall fail,    They shall have no way to flee;    Their hope shall be the giving up of the spirit."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
