Your abundance at this present time supplies their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply for your lack; that there may be equality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As it is written, "He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself very earnest, he went forth to you of his own accord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel is known through all the assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us in concerning this bounty which is served by us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker toward you. As for our brothers, they are the messengers of the assemblies, the glory of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
