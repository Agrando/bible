They had brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They said, "Come, let`s build us a city, and a tower, whose top reaches to the sky, and let`s make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yahweh said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do.
