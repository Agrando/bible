Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish of the sea are delivered into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Every moving thing that lives will be food for you. As the green herb, I have given everything to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But flesh with the life of it, the blood of it, you shall not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will surely require your blood of your lives. At the hand of every animal I will require it. At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man`s brother, I will require the life of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whoever sheds man`s blood, by man will his blood be shed, for in the image of God made he man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be fruitful, and multiply.

Of all that go out of the ark, even every animal of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will establish my covenant with you; neither will all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither will there any more be a flood to destroy the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The rainbow will be in the cloud. I will look at it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The sons of Noah who went forth from the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

Their faces were backwards, and they didn`t see their father`s nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He said, "Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants will he be to his brothers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem; Let Canaan be his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>God enlarge Japheth, Let him dwell in the tents of Shem; Let Canaan be his servant."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, then he died.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
