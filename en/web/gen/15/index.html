I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Abram said, "Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is Eliezer of Damascus?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Abram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, "This man will not be your heir, but he who will come forth out of your own body will be your heir."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yahweh brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky, and count the stars, if you be able to count them." He said to Abram, "So shall your seed be."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He said to him, "I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said, "Lord Yahweh, whereby will I know that I will inherit it?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to him, "Take me a heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn`t divide the birds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. Now terror and great darkness fell on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them. They will afflict them four hundred years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve.
