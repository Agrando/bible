There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram`s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot`s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived then in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Isn`t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot journeyed east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, "Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
