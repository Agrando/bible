He sojourned in Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Abraham said about Sarah his wife, "She is my sister." Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man`s wife."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now Abimelech had not come near her. He said, "Lord, will you kill even a righteous nation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Didn`t he tell me, `She is my sister?` She, even she herself said, `He is my brother.` In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands have I done this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn`t allow you to touch her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore, restore the man`s wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If you don`t restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all who are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. The men were very scared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, "What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you have done this thing?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Abraham said, "Because I thought, `Surely the fear of God is not in this place. They will kill me for my wife`s sake.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It happened, when God caused me to wander from my father`s house, that I said to her, `This is your kindness which you shall show to me. Everywhere that we go, say of me, "He is my brother."`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Abimelech took sheep and oxen, men-servants and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all that are with you. In front of all you are vindicated."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Abraham prayed to God. God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham`s wife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
