He called the name of that place Mahanaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He commanded them, saying, "This is what you shall tell my lord, Esau: `This is what your servant, Jacob, says. I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, men-servants, and maid-servants. I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau. Not only that, but he comes to meet you, and four hundred men with him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he said, "If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it, then the company which is left will escape."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jacob said, "God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, `Return to your country, and to your relatives, and I will do you good.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant; for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers with the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You said, `I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which can`t be numbered because there are so many.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He lodged there that night, and took from that which he had with him, a present for Esau, his brother:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass over before me, and put a space between herd and herd."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau, my brother, meets you, and asks you, saying, `Whose are you? Where are you going? Whose are these before you?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then you shall say, `They are your servant, Jacob`s. It is a present sent to my lord, Esau. Behold, he also is behind us.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau, when you find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall say, `Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob, is behind us.`" For, he said, "I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face. Perhaps he will accept me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until the breaking of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he saw that he didn`t prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob`s thigh was strained, as he wrestled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The man said, "Let me go, for the day breaks."     Jacob said, "I won`t let you go, unless you bless me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He said to him, "What is your name?"     He said, "Jacob."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said, "Your name will no longer be called `Jacob,` but, `Israel,` for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."     He said, "Why is it that you ask what my name is?" He blessed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, he said, "I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped because of his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore the children of Israel don`t eat the sinew of the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob`s thigh in the sinew of the hip.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
