Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves, change your garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Let us arise, and go up to Bethel. I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They journeyed: and a terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they didn`t pursue the sons of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Bethel), he and all the people who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He built an altar there, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Deborah, Rebekah`s nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>God said to him, "Your name is Jacob. Your name shall not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel." He named him Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>God said to him, "I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings will come out of your loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you, and to your seed after you will I give the land."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him, a pillar of stone. He poured out a drink-offering on it, and poured oil on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him "Bethel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They journeyed from Bethel. There was still some distance to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed. She had hard labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It happened that, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, "Don`t be afraid, for now you will have another son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It happened, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she named him Ben-oni, but his father named him Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jacob set up a pillar on her grave. The same is the Pillar of Rachel`s grave to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It happened, while Israel lived in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father`s concubine, and Israel heard of it.     Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob`s firstborn), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The sons of Bilhah (Rachel`s handmaid): Dan and Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The sons of Zilpah (Leah`s handmaid): Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people, old and full of days. Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
