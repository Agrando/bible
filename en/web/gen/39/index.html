Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh`s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought him down there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man. He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made all that he did prosper in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Joseph found favor in his sight. He ministered to him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Yahweh blessed the Egyptian`s house for Joseph`s sake; and the blessing of Yahweh was on all that he had, in the house and in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He left all that he had in Joseph`s hand. He didn`t concern himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.     Joseph was handsome, and well-favored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It happened after these things, that his master`s wife cast her eyes on Joseph; and she said, "Lie with me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he refused, and said to his master`s wife, "Behold, my master doesn`t know what is with me in the house, and he has put all that he has into my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He isn`t greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It happened that as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he didn`t listen to her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It happened about this time, that he went into the house to do his work, and there were none of the men of the house inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!"     He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It happened, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had run outside,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them, saying, "Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us. He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It happened, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She spoke to him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It happened, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your servant did to me," that his wrath was kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Joseph`s master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king`s prisoners were bound, and he was there in the custody.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph`s hand all the prisoners who were in the prison. Whatever they did there, he was the doer of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The keeper of the prison didn`t look after anything that was under his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did, Yahweh made it prosper.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
