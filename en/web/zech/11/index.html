I took to me two poles; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I cut off the three shepherds in one month; for my soul was weary of them, and their soul also loathed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, I will not feed you: that which dies, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let those who are left eat everyone the flesh of another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I took my staff Beauty, and cut it apart, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It was broken in that day; and thus the poor of the flock that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I said to them, If you think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my hire thirty [pieces] of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yahweh said to me, Cast it to the potter, the goodly price that I was prized at by them. I took the thirty [pieces] of silver, and cast them to the potter, in the house of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I cut apart my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yahweh said to me, Take to you yet again the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For, behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not visit those who are cut off, neither will seek those who are scattered, nor heal that which is broken, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the flesh of the fat [sheep], and will tear their hoofs in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Woe to the worthless shepherd who leaves the flock! the sword shall be on his arm, and on his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
