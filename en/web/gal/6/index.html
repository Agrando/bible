God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that will he also reap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don`t give up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For even they who receive circumcision don`t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As many as will walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God`s Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of Jesus branded on my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.
