You have fallen away from grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For we, through the Spirit, by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision amounts to anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You were running well! Who interfered with you that you should not obey the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This persuasion is not from him who calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little yeast grows through the whole lump.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have confidence toward you in the Lord that you will think no other way. But he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? Then the stumbling-block of the cross has been removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I wish that those who disturb you would cut themselves off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you, brothers, were called for freedom. Only don`t use your freedom for gain to the flesh, but through love be servants to one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you don`t consume one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you won`t fulfill the lust of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other, that you may not do the things that you desire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the works of the flesh are obvious, which are: adultery, sexual immorality, uncleanness, lustfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strife, jealousies, outbursts of anger, rivalries, divisions, heresies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envyings, murders, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live by the Spirit, let`s also walk by the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let`s not become conceited, provoking one another, and envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
