Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and there isn`t another gospel. Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any gospel other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any gospel other than that which you received, let him be cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn`t be a servant of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews` religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I advanced in the Jews` religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother`s womb, and called me through his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn`t immediately confer with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord`s brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I`m not lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but they only heard: "He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
