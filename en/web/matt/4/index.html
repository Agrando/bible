He set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,  `He will give his angels charge concerning you.`     and, `On their hands they will bear you up, So that you don`t dash your foot against a stone.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, `You shall not test the Lord, your God.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, the devil took him to an exceedingly high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to him, "I will give you all of these things, if you will fall down and worship me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind me, Satan!
