For they don`t wash their hands when they eat bread."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He answered them, "Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God commanded, `Honor your father and your mother,` and, `He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say, `Whoever will tell his father or his mother, "Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he will not honor his father or mother.` You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>`These people draw near to me with their mouth, And honor me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as doctrine rules made by men.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He called the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear, and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That which enters into the mouth doesn`t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the disciples came, and said to him, "Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered, "Every plant which my heavenly Father didn`t plant will be uprooted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Peter answered him, "Explain the parable to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jesus said, "Do you also still not understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Don`t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart, and they defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn`t defile the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, "Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David. My daughter is grievously vexed with a demon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answered her not a word.     His disciples came and begged him, saying, "Send her away; for she cries after us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he answered, "I wasn`t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But she came and worshipped him, saying, "Lord, help me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he answered, "It is not appropriate to take the children`s bread and throw it to the dogs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters` table."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered her, "Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire." And her daughter was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There came to him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that the multitude wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the injured whole, lame walking, and the blind seeing -- and they glorified the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, "I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don`t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples said to him, "Where should we get so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, "How many loaves do you have?"     They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
