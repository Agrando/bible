The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a great furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those men who don`t have God`s seal on their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In those days men will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like gold crowns, and their faces were like men`s faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They had hair like women`s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails is their power to harm men for five months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon," but in Greek, he has the name "Apollyon."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, "Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they would kill one third of mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million. I heard the number of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn`t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn`t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They didn`t repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
