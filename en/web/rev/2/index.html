To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>"To the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write:     "The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life says these things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"I know your oppression, and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Don`t be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He who overcomes won`t be hurt by the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>"To the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write:     "He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"I know your works and where you dwell, where Satan`s throne is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn`t deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Repent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes, to him will I give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"To the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write:     "The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know your works, your love, faith, service, patient endurance, and that your last works are more than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have this against you, that you tolerate your woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent of her works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will kill her children with Death, and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as don`t have this teaching, who don`t know what some call `the deep things of Satan,` to you I say, I don`t lay on you any other burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nevertheless that which you have, hold firmly until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end, to him will I give authority over the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He will rule them with a rod of iron, shattering them like clay pots; as I also have received of my Father:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I will give him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
