He laid his right hand on me, saying, "Don`t be afraid. I am the first and the last,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. I have the keys of Death and of Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies. The seven lampstands are seven assemblies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
