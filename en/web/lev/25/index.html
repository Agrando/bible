of them shall you take your bondservants forever: but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule, one over another, with rigor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>If a stranger or sojourner with you has grown rich, and your brother has grown poor beside him, and sell himself to the stranger [or] sojourner with you, or to the stock of the stranger`s family;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>after that he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brothers may redeem him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>or his uncle, or his uncle`s son, may redeem him, or any who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him; or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall he be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there be yet many years, according to them he shall give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>If there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he shall reckon with him; according to his years shall he give back the price of his redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him: he shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>If he isn`t redeemed by these [means], then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his children with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For to me the children of Israel are servants;
