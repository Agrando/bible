Whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goes from him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>or whoever touches any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he has;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>the soul that touches any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That which dies of itself, or is torn by animals, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest`s, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If a priest`s daughter be married to a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if a priest`s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned to her father`s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father`s bread: but there shall no stranger eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part of it to it, and shall give to the priest the holy thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to Yahweh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and [so] cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and tell them, Whoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offers his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer to Yahweh for a burnt offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>that you may be accepted, [you shall offer] a male without blemish, of the bulls, of the sheep, or of the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But whatever has a blemish, that shall you not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Whoever offers a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to Yahweh, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking in his parts, that may you offer for a freewill-offering;

you shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore shall you keep my commandments, and do them: I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You shall not profane my holy name;
