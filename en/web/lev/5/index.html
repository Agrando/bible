when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or if anyone swear rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it be that a man shall utter rashly with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these [things].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these [things], that he shall confess that in which he has sinned:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and he shall bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If his means aren`t sufficient for a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass-offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, to Yahweh; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide it apart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if his means aren`t sufficient for two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, then he shall bring his offering for that in which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon; for it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it as the memorial of it, and burn it on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The priest shall make atonement for him as touching his sin that he has sinned in any of these things, and he shall be forgiven: and [the remnant] shall be the priest`s, as the meal-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If anyone commits a trespass, and sin unwittingly, in the holy things of Yahweh; then he shall bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he shall make restitution for that which he has done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he shall be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone sins, and does any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done; though he didn`t know it, yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning the thing in which he erred unwittingly and didn`t know it, and he shall be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
