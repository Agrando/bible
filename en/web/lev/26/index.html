and you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil animals to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will have respect to you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall bring forth the old because of the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will set my tent among you: and my soul won`t abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you shall be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that you should not be their bondservants; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also will do this to you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck before your enemies: those who hate you shall rule over you; and you shall flee when none pursues you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If you will not yet for these things listen to me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your sky as iron, and your earth as brass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If you walk contrary to me, and won`t listen to me, I will bring seven times more plagues on you according to your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will send the animal of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If by these things you won`t be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then will I also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you, even I, seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I will bring a sword on you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and you shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and you shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If you won`t for all this listen to me, but walk contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies on the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries to desolation, and I won`t smell the savor of your sweet odors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the land enjoy its Sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you are in your enemies` land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it didn`t have in your Sabbaths, when you lived on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As for those who are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They shall stumble one on another, as it were before the sword, when none pursues: and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>You shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Those who are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies` lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its Sabbaths, while it lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
