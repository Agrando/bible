if it be a male, then your estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If it be a animal, whereof men offer an offering to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change animal for animal, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If it be any unclean animal, of which they do not offer an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal before the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you the priest value it, so shall it be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of it to your estimation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If he who sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If a man shall sanctify to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to the sowing of it: the sowing of a homer of barley [shall be valued] at fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it shall stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the year of jubilee;

he shall surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is Yahweh`s: it is holy to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If a man will redeem anything of his tithe, he shall add to it the fifth part of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>All the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These are the commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses for the children of Israel in Mount Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
