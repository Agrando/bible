The word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and the lamp of God hadn`t yet gone out, and Samuel had laid down [to sleep], in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God was;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. He said, I didn`t call; lie down again. He went and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yahweh called yet again, Samuel. Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. He answered, I didn`t call, my son; lie down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Samuel didn`t yet know Yahweh, neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. He arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me. Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, Yahweh; for your servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for your servant hears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yahweh said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring a curse on themselves, and he didn`t restrain them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli`s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. He said, Here am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said, "What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you? Please don`t hide it from me. God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. He said, It is Yahweh: let him do what seems him good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
