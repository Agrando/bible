Abiathar brought there the ephod to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David inquired of Yahweh, saying, If I pursue after this troop, shall I overtake them? He answered him, Pursue; for you shall surely overtake [them], and shall without fail recover [all].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those who were left behind stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn`t go over the brook Besor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him; for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>David said to him, To whom belong you? and whence are you? He said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop? He said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me, nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring you down to this troop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>David struck them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day: and there not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything that they had taken to them: David brought back all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove before those [other] cattle, and said, This is David`s spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people who were with him: and when David came near to the people, he greeted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who went with David, and said, Because they didn`t go with us, we will not give them anything of the spoil that we have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children, that he may lead them away, and depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers, with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us, and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who will listen to you in this matter? for as his share is who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries by the baggage: they shall share alike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>To those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth, and to those who were in Eshtemoa,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Bor-ashan, and to those who were in Athach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men used to stay.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
