They went out both of them into the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Jonathan said to David, Yahweh, the God of Israel, [be witness]: when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow, [or] the third day, behold, if there be good toward David, shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my father to do you evil, if I don`t disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in peace: and Yahweh be with you, as he has been with my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You shall not only while yet I live show me the lovingkindness of Yahweh, that I not die;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever; no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone from the surface of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying], Yahweh will require it at the hand of David`s enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon: and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly, and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, I will send the boy, [saying], Go, find the arrows. If I tell the boy, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you; take them, and come; for there is peace to you and no hurt, as Yahweh lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond you; go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold, Yahweh is between you and me forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was come, the king sat him down to eat food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul`s side: but David`s place was empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Nevertheless Saul didn`t say anything that day: for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It happened on the next day after the new moon, [which was] the second [day], that David`s place was empty: and Saul said to Jonathan his son, Why doesn`t the son of Jesse come to meat, neither yesterday, nor today?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Beth-lehem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and he said, Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me [to be there]: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers. Therefore he is not come to the king`s table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Saul`s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don`t I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother`s nakedness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall not be established, nor your kingdom. Why now send and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? what has he done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Saul cast his spear at him to strike him; whereby Jonathan knew that is was determined of his father to put David to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He said to his boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot. As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>When the boy was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said, Isn`t the arrow beyond you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jonathan cried after the boy, Go fast! Hurry! Don`t delay! Jonathan`s boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the boy didn`t know anything: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, Go, carry them to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, because we have sworn both of us in the name of Yahweh, saying, Yahweh shall be between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever. He arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
