Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn`t find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they weren`t there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn`t find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to him, See now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes surely to pass: now let us go there; peradventure he can tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a Prophet was before called a Seer.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you: make haste now, for he is come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>as soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat who are invited. Now therefore get you up; for at this time you shall find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They went up to the city; [and] as they came within the city, behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry is come to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Behold, the man of whom I spoke to you! this same shall have authority over my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, Please, where the seer`s house is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago, don`t set your mind on them; for they are found. For whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father`s house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you to me after this manner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the best place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. [Samuel] said, Behold, that which has been reserved! set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they were come down from the high place into the city, he talked with Saul on the housetop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They arose early: and it happened about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I may send you away. Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand you still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
