They said, He is witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Samuel said to the people, It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh, which he did to you and to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab; and they fought against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They cried to Yahweh, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side; and you lived in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No, but a king shall reign over us; when Yahweh your God was your king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have asked for: and, behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, and both you and also the king who reigns over you be followers of Yahweh your God, [well]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh be against you, as it was against your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh will do before your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Isn`t it wheat harvest today? I will call to Yahweh, that he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of Yahweh, in asking you a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Samuel called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins [this] evil, to ask us a king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Samuel said to the people, "Don`t be afraid; you have indeed done all this evil; yet don`t turn aside from following Yahweh, but serve Yahweh with all your heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and don`t turn aside; for [then would you go] after vain things which can`t profit nor deliver, for they are vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name`s sake, because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you: but I will instruct you in the good and the right way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart; for consider how great things he has done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
