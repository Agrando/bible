They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was kindled greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn`t come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen. The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They said to the messengers who came, Thus shall you tell the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.
