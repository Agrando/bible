am I not a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall you be our servants, and serve us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Beth-lehem-judah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man was an old man in the days of Saul, stricken [in years] among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons who went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father`s sheep at Beth-lehem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves, and carry [them] quickly to the camp to your brothers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the vale of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the place of the wagons, as the host which was going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage, and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father`s house free in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man who kills him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab`s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why are you come down? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you have come down that you might see the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He turned away from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul; and he sent for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>David said to Saul, Let no man`s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>David said to Saul, Your servant was keeping his father`s sheep; and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered it out of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Your servant struck both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David said, Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. Saul said to David, Go, and Yahweh shall be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Saul clad David with his clothing, and he put a helmet of brass on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>David girded his sword on his clothing, and he tried to go; for he had not proved it. David said to Saul, I can`t go with these; for I have not proved them. David put them off him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd`s bag which he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man who bore the shield went before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him; for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks? The Philistine cursed David by his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a javelin: but I come to you in the name of Yahweh of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>This day will Yahweh deliver you into my hand; and I will strike you, and take your head from off you; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn`t save with sword and spear: for the battle is Yahweh`s, and he will give you into our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead; and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath of it, and killed him, and cut off his head therewith. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron. The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I can`t tell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The king said, Inquire you whose son the stripling is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man? David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Beth-lehemite.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
