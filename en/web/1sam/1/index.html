The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why don`t you eat? and why is your heart grieved? am I not better to you than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the door-post of the temple of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept sore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli marked her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your wine from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Don`t count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression wasn`t sad any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It happened, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah didn`t go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not go up] until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and there abide forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good; wait until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word. So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh: and the child was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh. He worshipped Yahweh there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
