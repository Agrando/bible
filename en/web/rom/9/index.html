I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers` sake, my relatives according to the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>whose are the fathers, and of whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Neither, because they are Abraham`s seed, are they all children. But, "In Isaac will your seed be called."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this is a word of promise, "At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>it was said to her, "The elder will serve the younger."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Even as it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What will we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Certainly not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say then to me, "Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But no, man, who are you who replies against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or hasn`t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As he says also in Hosea, "I will call them `my people,` which were not my people; And her `beloved,` who was not beloved."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>"It will be that in the place where it was said to them, `You       are not my people,` There will they be called `sons of the living God.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Isaiah cries concerning Israel, "If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, It is the remnant who will be saved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, Because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>As Isaiah has said before, "Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us a seed, We would have become like Sodom, And would have been made like Gomorrah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What will we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn`t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn`t arrive at the law of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why? Because they didn`t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>even as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. And no one who believes in him will be put to shame."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
