Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>rejoicing in hope; enduring in oppression; continuing steadfastly in prayer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don`t curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don`t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don`t be wise in your own conceits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Repay no one evil for evil.

For it is written, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him.    If he is thirsty, give him a drink.
