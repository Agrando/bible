As it is written, "But the righteous shall live by faith."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because that which is known by God is revealed in them, for God revealed it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Because, knowing God, they didn`t glorify him as God, neither gave thanks, but became vain in their reasoning, and their senseless heart was darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and traded the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore God also gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this reason, God gave them up to vile passions. For their women changed the natural function into that which is against nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Likewise also the men, leaving the natural function of the woman, burned in their lust toward one another, men doing what is inappropriate with men, and receiving in themselves the due penalty of their error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even as they refused to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil habits, secret slanderers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>backbiters, hateful to God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unforgiving, unmerciful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with those who practice them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
