Or what is the profit of circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Much in every way! Because first of all, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For what if some were without faith? Will their lack of faith make of no effect the faithfulness of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Certainly not! Yes, let God be found true, but every man a liar. As it is written, "That you might be justified in your words, And might prevail when you come into judgment."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what will we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath? I speak like men do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Certainly not! For then how will God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if the truth of God through my lie abounded to his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), "Let us do evil, that good may come?" Those who say so are justly condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Are we better than they? No, in no way. For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As it is written, "There is no one righteous. No, not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks after God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have all turned aside. They have together become unprofitable. There is no one who does good, no, not, so much as one."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>"Their throat is an open tomb. With their tongues they have used deceit."  "The poison of vipers is under their lips;"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>"Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>"Their feet are swift to shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Destruction and misery are in their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The way of peace, they haven`t known."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>"There is no fear of God before their eyes."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be closed, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because by the works of the law, no flesh will be justified in his sight. For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now apart from the law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified by the law and the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all and on all those who believe. For there is no distinction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God set forth to be an atoning sacrifice, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done before, in the forbearance of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for the showing of his righteousness at this present time; that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him who has faith in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. By what manner of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We maintain therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or is God the God of Jews only? Isn`t he the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>if it is so that God is one. He will justify the circumcised by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we then make the law of no effect through faith? Certainly not! No, we establish the law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
