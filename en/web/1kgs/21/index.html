He laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you [another] vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So she wrote letters in Ahab`s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles who were in his city, [and] who lived with Naboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>She wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and set two men, base fellows, before him, and let them testify against him, saying, You did curse God and the king. Then carry him out, and stone him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, according as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The two men, the base fellows, came in and sat before him: and the base fellows bore witness against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did curse God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him to death with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It happened, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It happened, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to take possession of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, Have you killed and also taken possession? You shall speak to him, saying, Thus says Yahweh, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even your.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, my enemy? He answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will utterly sweep you away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and him who is shut up and him who is left at large in Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of Jezebel also spoke Yahweh, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Him who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him who dies in the field shall the birds of the sky eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(But there was none like Ahab, who did sell himself to do that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did, whom Yahweh cast out before the children of Israel.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It happened, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son`s days will I bring the evil on his house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
