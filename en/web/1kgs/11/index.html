He answered, Nothing: however only let me depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>God raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David killed them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and lived therein, and reigned in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother`s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>It happened at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it in twelve pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces; for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David`s sake and for Jerusalem`s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my ordinances, as did David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>However I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my servant`s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but I will take the kingdom out of his son`s hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>To his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I will take you, and you shall reign according to all that your soul desires, and shall be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>It shall be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, aren`t they written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
