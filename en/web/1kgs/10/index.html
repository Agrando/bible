So she turned, and went to her own land, she and her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred sixty-six talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>besides [that which] the traders [brought], and the traffic of the merchants, and of all the kings of the mingled people, and of the governors of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred [shekels] of gold went to one buckler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[he made] three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the finest gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There were six steps to the throne, and the top of the throne was round behind; and there were stays on either side by the place of the seat, and two lions standing beside the stays.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other on the six steps: there was nothing like it made in any kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All king Solomon`s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram: once every three years came the navy of Tarshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They brought every man his tribute, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing, and armor, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, that he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycamore-trees that are in the lowland, for abundance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The horses which Solomon had were brought out of Egypt; and the king`s merchants received them in droves, each drove at a price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>A chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred [shekels] of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty; and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
