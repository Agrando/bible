Daring, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>whereas angels, though greater in might and power, don`t bring a railing judgment against them before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, speaking evil in matters about which they are ignorant, will in their destroying surely be destroyed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>receiving the wages of unrighteousness; people who count it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceit while they feast with you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>having eyes full of adultery, and who can`t cease from sin; enticing unsettled souls; having a heart trained in greed; children of cursing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of wrong-doing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but he was rebuked for his own disobedience. A mute donkey spoke with man`s voice and stopped the madness of the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are wells without water, clouds driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness has been reserved forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For, uttering great swelling words of emptiness, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by licentiousness, those who are indeed escaping from those who live in error;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for by whom a man is overcome, by the same is he also brought into bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if, after they have escaped the defilement of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state has become worse with them than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it would be better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But it has happened to them according to the true proverb, "The dog turns to his own vomit again," and "the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
