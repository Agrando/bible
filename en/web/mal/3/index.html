Return to me, and I will return to you, says Yahweh of Hosts. But you say, Wherein shall we return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will a man rob God? yet you rob me. But you say, Wherein have we robbed you? In tithes and offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You are cursed with the curse; for you rob me, even this whole nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Bring the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, says Yahweh of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough [to receive it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, says Yahweh of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All nations shall call you happy; for you shall be a delightful land, says Yahweh of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your words have been stout against me, says Yahweh. Yet you say, What have we spoken against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You have said, It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before Yahweh of Hosts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now we call the proud happy; yes, those who work wickedness are built up; yes, they tempt God, and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then those who feared Yahweh spoke one with another; and Yahweh listened, and heard, and a book of memory was written before him, for those who feared Yahweh, and that thought on his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They shall be my, says Yahweh of Hosts, [even] my own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spares his own son who serves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then shall you return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him who serves God and him who doesn`t serve him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
