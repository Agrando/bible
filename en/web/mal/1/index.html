Yet you say, Wherein have you loved us? Was not Esau Jacob`s brother, says Yahweh: yet I loved Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus says Yahweh of Hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Yahweh has indignation forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Your eyes shall see, and you shall say, Yahweh be magnified beyond the border of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A son honors his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is my honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? says Yahweh of Hosts to you, priests, who despise my name. You say, Wherein have we despised your name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You offer polluted bread on my altar. You say, Wherein have we polluted you? In that you say, The table of Yahweh is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When you offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when you offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you? or will he accept your person? says Yahweh of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now, please entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us: this has been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? says Yahweh of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle [fire on] my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says Yahweh of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [shall be] offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name [shall be] great among the Gentiles, says Yahweh of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But you profane it, in that you say, The table of Yahweh is polluted, and the fruit of it, even its food, is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and you have snuffed at it, says Yahweh of Hosts; and you have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus you bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, says Yahweh of hosts, and my name is awesome among the Gentiles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
