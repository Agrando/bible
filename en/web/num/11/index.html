and why haven`t I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that you should tell me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing-father carries the sucking child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If you deal thus with me, please kill me out of hand, if I have found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yahweh said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will come down and talk with you there: and I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Yahweh will give you flesh, and you shall eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome to you; because that you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yahweh said to Moses, Has Yahweh`s hand grown short? now shall you see whether my word shall happen to you or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Moses went out, and told the people the words of Yahweh: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders: and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>There ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, My lord Moses, forbid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? would that all Yahweh`s people were prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>There went forth a wind from Yahweh, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day`s journey on this side, and a day`s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he who gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
