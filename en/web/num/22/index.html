Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they abide over against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covers the surface of the earth: now, come curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people; for they are blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Get you into your land; for Yahweh refuses to give me leave to go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Balaam answered the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can`t go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men are come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that shall you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>God`s anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam`s foot against the wall: and he struck her again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The angel of Yahweh went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam`s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me, I would there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? was I ever wont to do so to you? and he said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The angel of Yahweh said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary, because your way is perverse before me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even slain you, and saved her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, I have sinned; for I didn`t know that you stood in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>When Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Balak said to Balaam, Didn`t I earnestly send to you to call you? why didn`t you come to me? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you: have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>It happened in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
