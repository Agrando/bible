Moses prayed for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yahweh said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it on the standard: and it happened, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The children of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From there they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From there they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Yahweh, Vaheb in Suphah, The valleys of the Arnon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The slope of the valleys That inclines toward the dwelling of Ar, Leans on the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>From there [they journeyed] to Beer: that is the well whereof Yahweh said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then sang Israel this song: Spring up, well; sing you to it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The well, which the princes dug, Which the nobles of the people dug, With the scepter, [and] with their poles.     From the wilderness [they journeyed] to Mattanah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king`s highway, until we have passed your border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Israel took all these cities: and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, Come you to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, people of Chemosh: He has given his sons as fugitives, His daughters into captivity, To Sihon king of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which [reaches] to Medeba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns of it, and drove out the Amorites who were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yahweh said to Moses, Don`t fear him: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
