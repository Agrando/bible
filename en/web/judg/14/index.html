Samson said to his father, Get her for me; for she pleases me well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But his father and his mother didn`t know that it was of Yahweh; for he sought an occasion against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah: and, behold, a young lion roared against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he tore him as he would have torn a kid; and he had nothing in his hand: but he didn`t tell his father or his mother what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went; and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them, and they ate: but he didn`t tell them that he had taken the honey out of the body of the lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His father went down to the woman: and Samson made there a feast; for so used the young men to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you: if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but if you can`t declare it to me, then shall you give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing. They said to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said to them, Out of the eater came forth food, Out of the strong came forth sweetness.     They couldn`t in three days declare the riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson`s wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father`s house with fire: have you called us to impoverish us? is it not [so]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Samson`s wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me, and don`t love me: you have put forth a riddle to the children of my people, and haven`t told it me. He said to her, Behold, I haven`t told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her, because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? He said to them, If you hadn`t plowed with my heifer, You wouldn`t have found out my riddle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he went down to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave the changes [of clothing] to those who declared the riddle. His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father`s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Samson`s wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had used as his friend.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
