In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they didn`t come within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray you, through your land to my place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Sihon didn`t trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Won`t you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess? So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn`t you recover them within that time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong to war against me: Yahweh, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>However the king of the children of Ammon didn`t listen to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh`s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low, and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened my mouth to Yahweh, and I can`t go back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>She said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh; do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth, because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, even on the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>She said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said, Go. He sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her virginity on the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>It happened at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she was a virgin. It was a custom in Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
