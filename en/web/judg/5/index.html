Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song: Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then came down a remnant of the nobles [and] the people; Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Out of Ephraim [came down] they whose root is in Amalek; After you, Benjamin, among your peoples; Out of Machir came down governors, Out of Zebulun those who handle the marshal`s staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The princes of Issachar were with Deborah; As was Issachar, so was Barak; Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben There were great resolves of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Why sat you among the sheepfolds, To hear the whistling for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gilead abode beyond the Jordan: Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, Abode by his creeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the death, Naphtali, on the high places of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan. In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: They took no gain of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From the sky the stars fought, From their courses they fought against Sisera.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The river Kishon swept them away, That ancient river, the river Kishon. My soul, march on with strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then did the horse hoofs stamp By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Curse you Meroz, said the angel of Yahweh. Curse you bitterly the inhabitants of it, Because they didn`t come to the help of Yahweh, To the help of Yahweh against the mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Blessed above women shall Jael be, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He asked water, [and] she gave him milk; She brought him butter in a lordly dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She put her hand to the tent-pin, Her right hand to the workmen`s hammer; With the hammer she struck Sisera, she struck through his head; Yes, she pierced and struck through his temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; At her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Through the window she looked forth, and cried, The mother of Sisera [cried] through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? A lady, two ladies to every man; To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments, A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh: But let those who love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his       might.     The land had rest forty years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
