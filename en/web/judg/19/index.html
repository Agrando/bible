and whence come you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah to the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; from there am I, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am [now] going to the house of Yahweh; and there is no man who takes me into his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servants: there is no want of anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The old man said, Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants lie on me; only don`t lodge in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder; and they washed their feet, and ate and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man who came into your house, that we may know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, please don`t act so wickedly; seeing that this man is come into my house, don`t do this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do with them what seems good to you: but to this man don`t do any such folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the men wouldn`t listen to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man`s house where her lord was, until it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and, behold, the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered: then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and got him to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day: consider it, take counsel, and speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
