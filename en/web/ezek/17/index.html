Shall he prosper? shall he escape who does such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things; he shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, I will even bring it on his own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will spread my net on him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>All his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and you shall know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says the Lord Yahweh: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it; and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all birds of every wing; in the shade of the branches of it shall they dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>All the trees of the field shall know that I, Yahweh, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I, Yahweh, have spoken and have done it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
