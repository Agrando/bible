that you shall say, Because of the news, for it comes; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it condemns every tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yes, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the killer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Cry and wail, son of man; for it is on my people, it is on all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; strike therefore on your thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that condemns shall be no more? says the Lord Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one who is deadly wounded, which enters into their chambers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Gather you together, go to the right, set yourself in array, go to the left, wherever your face is set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also, you son of man, appoint two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they both shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows back and forth, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In his right hand was the divination [for] Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory, that they may be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because you have come to memory, you shall be taken with the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>thus says the Lord Yahweh: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this [shall be] no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say you, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies to you, to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your birth, will I judge you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I will pour out my indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men, skillful to destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; you shall be no more remembered: for I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
