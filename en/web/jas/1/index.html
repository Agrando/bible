So also will the rich man fade away in his pursuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed is the man who endures temptation, for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no man say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God," for God can`t be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But each one is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin; and the sin, when it is full grown, brings forth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Don`t be deceived, my beloved brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the anger of man doesn`t produce the righteousness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man beholding his natural face in a mirror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he who looks into the perfect law, the law of freedom, and continues, not being a hearer who forgets but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious, while he doesn`t bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man`s religion is worthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
