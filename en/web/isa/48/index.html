I have showed you new things from this time, even hidden things, which you have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day you didn`t hear them; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yes, you didn`t hear; yes, you didn`t know; yes, from of old your ear was not opened: for I knew that you did deal very treacherously, and was called a transgressor from the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For my name`s sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I not cut you off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For my own sake, for my own sake, will I do it; for how should [my name] be profaned? and my glory I will not give to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Listen to me, O Jacob, and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yes, my hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spread out the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Assemble yourselves, all you, and hear; who among them has declared these things? He whom Yahweh loves shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be on] the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Come you near to me, hear you this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord Yahweh has sent me, and his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus says Yahweh, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Yahweh your God, who teaches you to profit, who leads you by the way that you should go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that you had listened to my commandments! then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your loins like the grains of it: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go you forth from Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say you, Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They didn`t thirst when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no peace, says Yahweh, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
