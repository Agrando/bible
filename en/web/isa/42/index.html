Before they spring forth I tell you of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Sing to Yahweh a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; you who go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let the wilderness and the cities of it lift up [their voice], the villages that Kedar does inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let them give glory to Yahweh, and declare his praise in the islands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yahweh will go forth as a mighty man; he will stir up [his] zeal like a man of war: he will cry, yes, he will shout aloud; he will do mightily against his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have long time held my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: [now] will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will bring the blind by a way that they don`t know; in paths that they don`t know will I lead them; I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things will I do, and I will not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They shall be turned back, they shall be utterly put to shame, who trust in engraved images, who tell molten images, You are our gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger whom I send? Who is blind as he who is at peace, and blind as Yahweh`s servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You see many things, but don`t observe. His ears are open, but he doesn`t hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It pleased Yahweh, for his righteousness` sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But this is a people robbed and plundered; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses: they are for a prey, and none delivers; for a spoil, and none says, Restore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who is there among you who will give ear to this? who will listen and hear for the time to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Didn`t Yahweh? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient to his law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he poured on him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he didn`t know; and it burned him, yet he didn`t lay it to heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
