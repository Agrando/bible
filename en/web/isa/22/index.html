What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You that are full of shouting, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All your rulers fled away together, they were bound by the archers; all who were found of you were bound together; they fled afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore said I, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; don`t labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it is a day of confusion, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Elam bore the quiver, with chariots of men [and] horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It happened that your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He took away the covering of Judah; and you did look in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and you gathered together the waters of the lower pool;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and you numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>you made also a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you didn`t look to him who had done this, neither had you respect to him who purposed it long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day did the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and behold, joy and gladness, killing oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yahweh of Hosts revealed himself in my ears, Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you until you die, says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, Go, get you to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, [and say],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>"What do you here? and whom has you here, that you have hewed you out here a tomb? Cutting him out a tomb on high, chiseling a habitation for himself in the rock!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Behold, Yahweh, like a [strong] man, will hurl you away violently; yes, he will wrap you up closely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He will surely wind you round and round, [and toss you] like a ball into a large country; there shall you die, and there shall be the chariots of your glory, you shame of your lord`s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will thrust you from your office; and from your station shall you be pulled down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>It shall happen in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I will cloth him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt, and I will commit your government into his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The key of the house of David will I lay on his shoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father`s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They shall hang on him all the glory of his father`s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the pitchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In that day, says Yahweh of hosts, shall the nail that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it shall be hewn down, and fall; and the burden that was on it shall be cut off; for Yahweh has spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
