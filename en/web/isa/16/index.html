For the extortioner is brought to nothing, destruction ceases, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A throne shall be established in lovingkindness; and one shall sit thereon in truth, in the tent of David, judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have heard of the pride of Moab, [that] he is very proud; even of his arrogance, and his pride, and his wrath; his boastings are nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, everyone shall wail: for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth shall you mourn, utterly stricken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the fields of Heshbon languish, [and] the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches of it, which reached even to Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness; its shoots were spread abroad, they passed over the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I will water you with my tears, Heshbon, and Elealeh: for on your summer fruits and on your harvest the [battle] shout is fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither joyful noise: nobody shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the [vintage] shout to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why my heart sounds like a harp for Moab, and my inward parts for Kir-heres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It shall happen, when Moab presents himself, when he wearies himself on the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is the word that Yahweh spoke concerning Moab in time past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But now Yahweh has spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and of no account.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
