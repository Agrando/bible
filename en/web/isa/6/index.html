Then I said, Here am I; send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but don`t understand; and see you indeed, but don`t perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said I, Lord, how long? He answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and Yahweh have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock of it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
