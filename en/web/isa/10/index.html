For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ho Assyrian, the rod of my anger, the staff in whose hand is my indignation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will send him against a profane nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>However he doesn`t mean so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy, and to cut off not a few nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he says, Aren`t my princes all of them kings?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Isn`t Calno as Carchemish?
