In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time has he made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light: those who lived in the land of the shadow of death, on them has the light shined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You have multiplied the nation, you have increased their joy: they joy before you according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as in the day of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, on the throne of David, and on his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even forever. The zeal of Yahweh of Hosts will perform this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted on Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>All the people shall know, [even] Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone; the sycamores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore Yahweh will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet the people have not turned to him who struck them, neither have they sought Yahweh of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The elder and the honorable man, he is the head; and the prophet who teaches lies, he is the tail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For those who lead this people cause them to err; and those who are led of them are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore the Lord will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for everyone is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For wickedness burns as the fire; it devours the briers and thorns; yes, it kindles in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Through the wrath of Yahweh of hosts is the land burnt up; and the people are as the fuel of fire: no man spares his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>One shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
