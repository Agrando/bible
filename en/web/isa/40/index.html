One said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory of it is as the flower of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withers, the flower fades, because the breath of Yahweh blows on it; surely the people is grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God shall stand forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You who tell good news to Zion, get you up on a high mountain; you who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength; lift it up, don`t be afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the Lord Yahweh will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, [and] will gently lead those who have their young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out the sky with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh, or being his counselor has taught him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: Behold, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the animals of it sufficient for a burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will you liken God? or what likeness will you compare to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The image, a workman has cast [it], and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts [for it] silver chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who is too impoverished for [such] an offering chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks to him a skillful workman to set up an engraved image, that shall not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have you not known? have yet not heard? has it not been told you from the beginning? have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[It is] he who sits above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants of it are as grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who brings princes to nothing; who makes the judges of the earth as vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, they have not been planted; yes, they have not been sown; yes, their stock has not taken root in the earth: moreover he blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will you liken me, that I should be equal [to him]? says the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has created these, who brings out their host by number; he calls them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and because he is strong in power, not one is lacking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why say you, Jacob, and speak, Israel, My way is hid from Yahweh, and the justice [due] to me is passed away from my God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Have you not known? have you not heard?
