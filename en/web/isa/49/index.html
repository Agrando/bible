They shall feed in the ways, and on all bare heights shall be their pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun strike them: for he who has mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water will he guide them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Behold, these shall come from far; and, behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing, heavens; and be joyful, earth; and break forth into singing, mountains: for Yahweh has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Zion said, Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yes, these may forget, yet I will not forget you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your children make haste; your destroyers and those who made you waste shall go forth from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lift up your eyes round about, and see: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, says Yahweh, you shall surely clothe you with them all as with an ornament, and gird yourself with them, like a bride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed, surely now shall you be too strait for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up shall be far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The children of your bereavement shall yet say in your ears, The place is too strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then shall you say in your heart, Who has conceived these for me, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering back and forth? and who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where were they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my ensign to the peoples; and they shall bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am Yahweh; and those who wait for me shall not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captives be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thus says Yahweh, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
