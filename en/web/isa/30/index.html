Through the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people that shall not profit [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I called her Rahab who sits still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is a rebellious people, lying children, children who will not hear the law of Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who tell the seers, "Don`t see;" and to the prophets, "Don`t prophesy to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because you despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely thereon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He shall break it as a potter`s vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there shall not be found among the pieces of it a broken piece with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus said the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength. You would not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but you said, No, for we will flee on horses; therefore shall you flee: and, We will ride on the swift; therefore shall those who pursue you be swift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>One thousand [shall flee] at the threat of one; at the threat of five shall you flee: until you be left as a beacon on the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore will Yahweh wait, that he may be gracious to you; and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy on you: for Yahweh is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; you shall weep no more; he will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry; when he shall hear, he will answer you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not your teachers be hidden anymore, but your eyes shall see your teachers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk you in it; when you turn to the right hand, and when you turn to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall defile the overlaying of your engraved images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold: you shall cast them away as an unclean thing; you shall tell it, Get you hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He will give the rain for your seed, with which you shall sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous.
