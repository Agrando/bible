Aren`t you children of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; even to them have you poured a drink-offering, you have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On a high and lofty mountain have you set your bed; there also went you up to offer sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behind the doors and the posts have you set up your memorial: for you have uncovered [yourself] to another than me, and are gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and made you a covenant with them: you loved their bed where you saw it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You went to the king with oil, and did increase your perfumes, and did send your ambassadors far off, and did debase yourself even to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn`t say, It is in vain: you found a reviving of your strength; therefore you weren`t faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? Haven`t I held my peace even of long time, and you don`t fear me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they shall not profit you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will say, Cast you up, cast you up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who I have made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid [my face] and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near, says Yahweh; and I will heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can`t rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
