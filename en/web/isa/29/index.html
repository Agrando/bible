Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him who made it, He didn`t make me; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, He has no understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The humble also shall increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who watch for iniquity are cut off;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that make a man an offender in [his] cause, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yes, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They also who err in spirit shall come to understanding, and those who murmur shall receive instruction.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
