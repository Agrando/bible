Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal; and they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They ate of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are you for us, or for our adversaries?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said, No; but [as] prince of the host of Yahweh am I now come. Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said to him, What says my lord to his servant?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The prince of Yahweh`s host said to Joshua, Put off your shoe from off your foot; for the place whereon you stand is holy. Joshua did so.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
