and it will be, seeing you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass you over to the land of the possession of Yahweh, in which Yahweh`s tent dwells, and take possession among us: but don`t rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar besides the altar of Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Didn`t Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man didn`t perish alone in his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows; and Israel he shall know: if it be in rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh (don`t save us this day,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings thereon, let Yahweh himself require it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this, [and] of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no portion in Yahweh: so might your children make our children cease from fearing Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Yahweh before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your children may not tell our children in time to come, You have no portion in Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so tell us or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say, Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us, because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh: now have you delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben and the children of Gad lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar [Ed]: For, [said they], it is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
