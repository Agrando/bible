For we didn`t behave ourselves rebelliously among you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>neither did we eat bread for nothing from any man`s hand, but in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>not because we don`t have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: "If anyone will not work, neither let him eat."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don`t work at all, but are busybodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you, brothers, don`t be weary in doing well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man doesn`t obey our word by this letter, note that man, that you have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Don`t count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The greeting of me, Paul, with my own hand, which is the sign in every letter. This is how I write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
