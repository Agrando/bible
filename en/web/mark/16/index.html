Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He said to them, "Don`t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, `He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.`"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They went away and told it to the rest. They didn`t believe them, either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn`t believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, "Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they will take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
