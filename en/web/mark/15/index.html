He answered, "So you say."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The chief priests accused him of many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus made no further answer, so Pilate marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Pilate again asked them, "What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They cried out again, "Crucify him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?"     But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place of a skull."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn`t take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It was the third hour, and they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The superscription of his accusation was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was numbered with transgressors."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>save yourself, and come down from the cross!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He can`t save himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him." Those who were crucified with him reproached him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold, he calls Elijah."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him be. Let`s see whether Elijah comes to take him down."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joseph of Arimathaea, a member of the council of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus` body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>When he learned it from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
