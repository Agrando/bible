To save a life, or to kill?" But they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The Pharisees went out, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He spoke to his disciples, that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn`t press on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, "You are the Son of God!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He went up into the mountain, and called to himself whom he wanted, and they went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
