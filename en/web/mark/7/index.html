You do many things like this."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When he had entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to them, "Are you so without understanding also? Don`t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can`t defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because it doesn`t go into his heart, but into his belly, and into the latrine, thus making all foods clean?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He said, "That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and wanted no one to know it, but he couldn`t escape detection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children`s bread and throw it to the dogs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. For even the dogs under the table eat the children`s crumbs."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said to her, "For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>She went away to her house, and found the child laying on the bed, with the demon gone out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He charged them that they should tell no one, but the more he charged them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
