They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>John was clothed with camel`s hair and a leather belt around his loins. He ate locusts and wild honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals. The angels ministered to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the gospel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Going on a little further from there, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, "Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Simon`s wife`s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>All the city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn`t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Early in the night, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon and those who were with him followed after him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they found him, and told him, "All are seeking you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said to them, "Let`s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, for to this end I came forth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There came to him a leper, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made clean."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He strictly charged him, and immediately sent him out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
