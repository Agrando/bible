She said to her, Go, my daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, Yahweh be with you. They answered him, Yahweh bless you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose young lady is this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don`t you hear, my daughter? Don`t go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them: haven`t I charged the young men that they shall not touch you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight, that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Boaz answered her, It has fully been showed me, all that you have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband; and how you have left your father and your mother, and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you didn`t know before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come to take refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>At meal-time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip your morsel in the vinegar. She sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed, and left of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and don`t reproach her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and don`t rebuke her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you. She showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man`s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us, one of our near kinsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you in any other field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived with her mother-in-law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
