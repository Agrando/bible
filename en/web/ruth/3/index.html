Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don`t make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>She said to her, All that you say I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said, Who are you? She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid: spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are a near kinsman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He said, Blessed be you of Yahweh, my daughter: you have showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn`t follow young men, whether poor or rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, my daughter, don`t be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is a kinsman nearer than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman`s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives: lie down until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She lay at his feet until the morning.
