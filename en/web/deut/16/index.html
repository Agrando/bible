for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth out of Egypt by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>There shall be no yeast seen with you in all your borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates, which Yahweh your God gives you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose: and you shall turn in the morning, and go to your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Six days you shall eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God; you shall do no work [therein].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Seven weeks shall you number to you: from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain shall you begin to number seven weeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute of a freewill-offering of your hand, which you shall give, according as Yahweh your God blesses you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your man-servant, and your maid-servant, and the Levite who is within your gates, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in the midst of you, in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt: and you shall observe and do these statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall keep the feast of tents seven days, after that you have gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your man-servant, and your maid-servant, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days shall you keep a feast to Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh shall choose;

and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall not wrest justice: you shall not respect persons; neither shall you take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>That which is altogether just shall you follow, that you may live, and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You shall not plant you an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of Yahweh your God, which you shall make you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Neither shall you set you up a pillar;
