and that your days may be prolonged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God; Yahweh is one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You shall write them on the door-posts of your house, and on your gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It shall be, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn`t build,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and houses full of all good things, which you didn`t fill, and cisterns dug out, which you didn`t dig, vineyards and olive-trees, which you didn`t plant, and you shall eat and be full;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall fear Yahweh your God;
