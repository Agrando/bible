Now it is in the world already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are of God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are of the world. Therefore they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We are of God. He who knows God listens to us. He who is not of God doesn`t listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God, and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who doesn`t love doesn`t know God, for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By this was God`s love revealed in us, that God has sent his only born Son into the world that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son as the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God loved us so, we also ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>By this we know that we remain in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever will confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>We know and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In this love has been made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is, even so are we in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear has punishment. He who fears is not made perfect in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We love Him, because he first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If a man says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who doesn`t love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This commandment have we from him, that he who loves God should also love his brother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
