For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of       Yahweh from Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he will judge between many       peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and       they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears       into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against       nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they       shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and       none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of Yahweh of Hosts has       spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all the peoples walk everyone in the name of       his god; and we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever       and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In that day, says Yahweh, will I assemble that       which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and       that which I have afflicted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I will make that which was       lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation:       and Yahweh will reign over them on Mount Zion from henceforth       even forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You, tower of the flock, the hill of the       daughter of Zion, to you shall it come, yes, the former dominion       shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now       why do you cry out aloud?
