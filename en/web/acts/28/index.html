Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed, they put on board the things that we needed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Brothers."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium. After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>where we found brothers, and were entreated to stay with them seven days. So we came to Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It happened, that after three days Paul called together those who were the leaders of the Jews. When they had come together, he said to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free, because there was no cause of death in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to accuse my nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For this cause therefore did I ask you to see and to speak with me. For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report or speak any evil of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we desire to hear of you what you think. For, as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number. He explained to them, testifying about the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When they didn`t agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had spoken one word, "The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>saying, `Go to this people, and say, In hearing, you will hear, and will in no way understand. In seeing, you will see, and will in no way perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this people`s heart has grown callous. Their ears are dull of hearing. Their eyes they have closed. Lest they should see with their eyes, Hear with their ears, Understand with their heart, Would turn again, And I would heal them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>"Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles. They will also hear."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who went in to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hinderance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
