A great persecution arose against the assembly which was in Jerusalem in that day. They were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except for the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Devout men buried Stephen, and lamented greatly over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into every house, and dragged both men and women off to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore those who were scattered abroad went around preaching the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The multitudes listened with one accord to the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard and saw the signs which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For unclean spirits came out of many of those who had them. They came out, crying with a loud voice. Many who had been paralyzed and lame were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There was great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who had used sorcery in the city before, and amazed the people of Samaria, making himself out to be some great one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to whom they all listened, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is that great power of God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They listened to him, because for a long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip preaching good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Simon himself also believed. Being baptized, he continued with Philip. Seeing signs and great miracles done, he was amazed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for as yet he had fallen on none of them. They had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles` hands, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, "Give me also this power, that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart isn`t right before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore of this, your wickedness, and ask God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bondage of iniquity."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that none of the things which you have spoken come on me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He arose and went. Behold, there was a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The Spirit said to Philip, "Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, "Do you understand you what you are reading?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He said, "How can I, unless someone explains it to me?" He begged Philip to come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter.    As a lamb before his shearer is silent,    So he doesn`t open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In his humiliation, his judgment was taken away.    Who will declare His generations?    For his life is taken from the earth."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The eunuch answered Philip, "Please tell who the prophet is talking about: about himself, or about some other?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached to him Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As they went on the way, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Behold, here is water. What is keeping me from being baptized?"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>dummy verses inserted by amos</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He commanded the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch didn`t see him any more, for he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found at Azotus. Passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
