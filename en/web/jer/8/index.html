Shall one turn away, and not return?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I listened and heard, but they didn`t speak aright: no man repents him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? everyone turns to his course, as a horse that rushes headlong in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yes, the stork in the sky knows her appointed times; and the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming; but my people don`t know the law of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How do you say, We are wise, and the law of Yahweh is with us? But, behold, the false pen of the scribes has worked falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The wise men are put to shame, they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have rejected the word of Yahweh; and what manner of wisdom is in them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to those who shall possess them: for everyone from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness; from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among those who fall; in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will utterly consume them, says Yahweh: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf shall fade; and [the things that] I have given them shall pass away from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there; for Yahweh our God has put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>We looked for peace, but no good came; [and] for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones the whole land trembles; for they are come, and have devoured the land and all that is in it; the city and those who dwell therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, behold, I will send serpents, adders, among you, which will not be charmed; and they shall bite you, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Oh that I could comfort myself against sorrow! my heart is faint within me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people from a land that is very far off: isn`t Yahweh in Zion? Isn`t her King in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their engraved images, and with foreign vanities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt: I mourn; dismay has taken hold on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then isn`t the health of the daughter of my people recovered?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
