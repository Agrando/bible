your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all those who devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, everyone of them, shall go into captivity; and those who despoil you shall be a spoil, and all who prey on you will I give for a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob`s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be built on its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their children also shall be as before, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me? says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You shall be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, the tempest of Yahweh, [even his] wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst on the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of Yahweh shall not return, until he has executed, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
