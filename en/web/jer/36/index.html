So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand, and came to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now it happened, when they had heard all the words, they turned in fear one toward another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How did you write all these words at his mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide you, you and Jeremiah; and let no man know where you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They went in to the king into the court; but they had laid up the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they told all the words in the ears of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll; and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth month: and [there was a fire in] the brazier burning before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>It happened, when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, that [the king] cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was in the brazier, until all the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They were not afraid, nor tore their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Moreover Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the scroll; but he would not hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The king commanded Jerahmeel the king`s son, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Yahweh hid them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the scroll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take again another scroll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, Thus says Yahweh: You have burned this scroll, saying, Why have you written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from there man and animal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: He shall have none to sit on the throne of David; and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring on them, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they didn`t listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then took Jeremiah another scroll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides to them many like words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
