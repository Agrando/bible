Woe to us! for the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus has Yahweh of Hosts said, Hew you down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be you instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from you; lest I make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again your hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can`t listen: behold, the word of Yahweh is become to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh; I am weary with holding in: pour it out on the children in the street, and on the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him who is full of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Their houses shall be turned to others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For from the least of them even to the greatest of them everyone is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says Yahweh, Stand you in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk [therein].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I set watchmen over you, [saying], Listen to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear, you nations, and know, congregation, what is among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear, earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To what purpose comes there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says Yahweh, Behold, a people comes from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We have heard the report of it; our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Don`t go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have made you a tester of metals [and] a fortress among my people; that you may know and try their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They are all grievous rebels, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Refuse silver shall men them, because Yahweh has rejected them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
