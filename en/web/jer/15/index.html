I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; [yet] everyone of them does curse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yahweh said, Most assuredly I will strengthen you for good; most assuredly I will cause the enemy to make supplication to you in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can one break iron, even iron from the north, and brass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Your substance and your treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will make [them] to pass with your enemies into a land which you don`t know; for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yahweh, you know; remember me, and visit me, and avenge me of my persecutors; don`t take me away in your longsuffering: know that for your sake I have suffered reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Your words were found, and I ate them; and your words were to me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, Yahweh, God of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I didn`t sit in the assembly of those who make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your hand; for you have filled me with indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you indeed be to me as a deceitful [brook], as waters that fail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh, If you return, then will I bring you again, that you may stand before me; and if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: they shall return to you, but you shall not return to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will make you to this people a fortified brazen wall; and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you; for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
