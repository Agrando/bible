shall not sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If you say in your heart, Why are these things come on me? for the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may you also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passes away, by the wind of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me, says Yahweh; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore will I also uncover your skirts on your face, and your shame shall appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have seen your abominations, even your adulteries, and your neighing, the lewdness of your prostitution, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, Jerusalem! you will not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
