But he didn`t listen to him; so Irijah laid hold on Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The princes were angry with Jeremiah, and struck him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon-house, and into the cells, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and fetched him: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from Yahweh? Jeremiah said, There is. He said also, You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, Wherein have I sinned against you, or against your servants, or against this people, that you have put me in prison?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Where now are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now please hear, my lord the king: please let my supplication be presented before you, that you not cause me to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed Jeremiah into the court of the guard; and they gave him daily a loaf of bread out of the bakers` street, until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
