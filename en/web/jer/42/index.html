for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes do see us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray to Yahweh your God according to your words; and it shall happen that whatever thing Yahweh shall answer you, I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then they said to Jeremiah, Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we don`t do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God shall send you to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>It happened after ten days, that the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me to present your supplication before him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Don`t be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid; don`t be afraid of him, says Yahweh: for I am with you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you, and cause you to return to your own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if you say, We will not dwell in this land; so that you don`t obey the voice of Yahweh your God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there will we dwell:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>now therefore hear you the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah: Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel, If you indeed set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then it shall happen, that the sword, which you fear, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, whereof you are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in Egypt; and there you shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath has been poured forth on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath be poured forth on you, when you shall enter into Egypt; and you shall be an object of horror, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you shall see this place no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yahweh has spoken concerning you, remnant of Judah, Don`t you go into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified to you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you have dealt deceitfully against your own souls; for you sent me to Yahweh your God, saying, Pray for us to Yahweh our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has sent me to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you desire to go to sojourn there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
