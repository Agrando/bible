In the dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the mire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king`s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Ebed-melech went forth out of the king`s house, and spoke to the king, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is likely to die in the place where he is, because of the famine; for there is no more bread in the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with you, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took there rags and worn-out garments, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put now these rags and worn-out garments under your armholes under the cords. Jeremiah did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they drew up Jeremiah with the cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of Yahweh: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask you a thing; hide nothing from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to you, will you not surely put me to death? and if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As Yahweh lives, who made us this soul, I will not put you to death, neither will I give you into the hand of these men who seek your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: If you will go forth to the king of Babylon`s princes, then your soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and you shall live, and your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you will not go forth to the king of Babylon`s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews who are fallen away to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver you. Obey, I beg you, the voice of Yahweh, in that which I speak to you: so it shall be well with you, and your soul shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if you refuse to go forth, this is the word that Yahweh has showed me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>behold, all the women who are left in the king of Judah`s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon`s princes, and those women shall say, Your familiar friends have set you on, and have prevailed over you: [now that] your feet are sunk in the mire, they are turned away back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall bring out all your wives and your children to the Chaldeans; and you shall not escape out of their hand, but shall be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and you shall cause this city to be burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and you shall not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they come to you, and tell you, Declare to us now what you have said to the king; don`t hide it from us, and we will not put you to death; also what the king said to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan`s house, to die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him; and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
