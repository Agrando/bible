Didn`t your father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? then it was well with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Wasn`t this to know me? says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they shall not lament for him, [saying], Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! They shall not lament for him, [saying] Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all your lovers are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has been your manner from your youth, that you didn`t obey my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind shall feed all your shepherds, and your lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shall you be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Inhabitant of Lebanon, who makes your nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied shall you be when pangs come on you, the pain as of a woman in travail!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As I live, says Yahweh, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet would I pluck you there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I will cast you out, and your mother who bore you, into another country, where you were not born; and there shall you die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But to the land whereunto their soul longs to return, there shall they not return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? is he a vessel in which none delights? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they don`t know?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus says Yahweh, Write you this man childless, a man who shall not prosper in his days; for no more shall a man of his seed prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
