says Yahweh; shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the pastures of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none passes through; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the birds of the sky and the animals are fled, they are gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and [who is] he to whom the mouth of Yahweh has spoken, that he may declare it? why is the land perished and burned up like a wilderness, so that none passes through?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yahweh says, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after the Baals, which their fathers taught them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>therefore thus says Yahweh of Hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I will scatter them also among the nations, whom neither they nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus says Yahweh of Hosts, Consider you, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for the skillful women, that they may come:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we ruined! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because they have cast down our dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yet hear the word of Yahweh, you women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth; and teach your daughters wailing, and everyone her neighbor lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For death is come up into our windows, it is entered into our palaces; to cut off the children from outside, [and] the young men from the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Speak, Thus says Yahweh, The dead bodies of men shall fall as dung on the open field, and as the handful after the harvester; and none shall gather [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus says Yahweh, Don`t let the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, don`t let the rich man glory in his riches;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but let him who glories glory in this, that he has understanding, and knows me, that I am Yahweh who exercises lovingkindness, justice, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will punish all those who are circumcised in [their] uncircumcision:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that have the corners [of their hair] cut off, who dwell in the wilderness; for all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
