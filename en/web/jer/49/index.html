Thus says Yahweh: Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does Malcam possess Gad, and his people well in the cities of it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel possess those who did possess him, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth: lament, and run back and forth among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why glory you in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding daughter? who trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold, I will bring a fear on you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Hosts, from all who are round about you; and you shall be driven out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather together the fugitives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of Edom. Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee you, turn back, dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I shall visit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, wouldn`t they destroy until they had enough?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brothers, and his neighbors; and he is no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says Yahweh: Behold, they to whom it didn`t pertain to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and are you he who shall altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished, but you shall surely drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities of it shall be perpetual wastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, [saying], Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, behold, I have made you small among the nations, and despised among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you, O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Edom shall become an astonishment: everyone who passes by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who will stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they shall drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil news, they are melted away: there is sorrow on the sea; it can`t be quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Damascus has grown feeble, she turns herself to flee, and trembling has seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh of Hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon struck. Thus says Yahweh: Arise you, go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Terror on every side!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Flee you, wander far off, dwell in the depths, you inhabitants of Hazor, says Yahweh; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Arise, get you up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells without care, says Yahweh; that have neither gates nor bars, that dwell alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners [of their hair] cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation forever: no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus says Yahweh of Hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>On Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of the sky, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those who seek their life; and I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger, says Yahweh; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there king and princes, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, says Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
