We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, behold, dismay!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge, Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not abhor [us], for your name`s sake; do not disgrace the throne of your glory: remember, don`t break your covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? or can the sky give showers? Aren`t you he, Yahweh our God? therefore we will wait for you; for you have made all these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
