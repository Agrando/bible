But God`s word isn`t bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I endure all things for the elect`s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This saying is faithful: For if we died with him, we will also live with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we will deny him, he also will deny us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If we are faithless, he remains faithful -- he can`t deny himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don`t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn`t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But shun empty chatter, for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and their word will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However God`s firm foundation stands, having this seal, "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If a man therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master`s use, prepared for every good work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Lord`s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>in gentleness correcting those who oppose him; if perhaps God may give them repentance to the knowledge of the truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and they may recover themselves out of the devil`s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
