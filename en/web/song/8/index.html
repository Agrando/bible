If I found you outside, I would kiss you;    Yes, and no one would despise me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I would lead you, bringing you into my mother`s house,    Who would instruct me. I would have you drink spiced wine,    Of the juice of my pomegranate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>His left hand would be under my head.    His right hand would embrace me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,    That you not stir up, nor awaken love,    Until it so desires.  Friends</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who is this who comes up from the wilderness,    Leaning on her beloved?  Under the apple tree I aroused you.    There your mother conceived you.    There she was in labor and bore you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Set me as a seal on your heart,    As a seal on your arm;    For love is strong as death.    Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol;    Its flashes are flashes of fire,    A very flame of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Many waters can`t quench love,    Neither can floods drown it. If a man would give all the wealth of his house for love,    He would be utterly scorned.  Friends</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>We have a little sister.    She has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister    In the day when she is to be spoken for?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If she is a wall,    We will build on her a turret of silver. If she is a door,    We will enclose her with boards of cedar.  Beloved</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I am a wall, and my breasts like towers,    Then I was in his eyes like one who found peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon.    He leased out the vineyard to keepers.    Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>My own vineyard is before me.    The thousand are for you, Solomon;    Two hundred for those who tend its fruit.  Lover</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You who dwell in the gardens, with friends in attendance,    Let me hear your voice!  Beloved</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Come away, my beloved!    Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
