I have gathered my myrrh with my spice;    I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey;    I have drunk my wine with my milk.  Friends Eat, friends!    Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.  Beloved</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I was asleep, but my heart was awake.    It is the voice of my beloved who knocks:    Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled;    For my head is filled with dew,    My hair with the dampness of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on?    I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening.    My heart pounded for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I rose up to open for my beloved.    My hands dripped with myrrh,    My fingers with liquid myrrh,    On the handles of the lock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I opened to my beloved;    But my beloved left; gone away. My heart went out when he spoke.    I looked for him, but I didn`t find him.    I called him, but he didn`t answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The watchmen who go about the city found me.    They beat me.    They bruised me.    The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem,    If you find my beloved,    That you tell him that I am faint with love.  Friends</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>How is your beloved better than another beloved,    You fairest among women? How is your beloved better than another beloved, That you do so adjure us?  Beloved</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My beloved is white and ruddy.    The best among ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His head is like the purest gold.    His hair is bushy, black as a raven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks,    Washed with milk, mounted like jewels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes.    His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl.    His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold.    His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His mouth is sweetness;    Yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend,    Daughters of Jerusalem.   Friends</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
