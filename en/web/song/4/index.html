Behold, you are beautiful. Your eyes are doves behind your veil.    Your hair is as a flock of goats,    That descend from Mount Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Your teeth are like a newly shorn flock,    Which have come up from the washing,    Where every one of them has twins.    None is bereaved among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Your lips are like scarlet thread.    Your mouth is lovely.    Your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind your veil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your neck is like David`s tower built for an armory,    Whereon there hang a thousand shields,    All the shields of the mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Your two breasts are like two fawns    That are twins of a roe,    Which feed among the lilies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away,    I will go to the mountain of myrrh,    To the hill of frankincense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You are all beautiful, my love.    There is no spot in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,    With me from Lebanon.

You have ravished my heart with one of your eyes,    With one chain of your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride!    How much better is your love than wine!    The fragrance of your perfumes than all manner of spices!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Your lips, my bride, drip like the honeycomb.
