but he with an oath by him that says of him, "The Lord swore and will not change his mind,    `You are a priest forever,    According to the order of Melchizedek`".</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By so much has Jesus become the collateral of a better covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered from continuing by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For such a high priest was fitting for us: holy, guiltless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who doesn`t need, like those high priests, to daily offer up sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. For this he did once for all, when he offered up himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the law appoints men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, appoints a Son, perfected forevermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
