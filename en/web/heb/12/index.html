God deals with you as with sons, for what son is there whom his father doesn`t discipline?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if you are without discipline, whereof all have been made partakers, then are you illegitimate, and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised thereby.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>looking carefully lest there be any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby the many be defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest there be any sexually immoral person, or profane person, as Esau, who sold his birthright for one meal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for a change of mind though he sought it diligently with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for they could not stand that which was enjoined, "If even a animal touch the mountain, it will be stoned;"</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, "I am terrified and trembling."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to God, the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than that of Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See that you don`t refuse him who speaks. For if they didn`t escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth, how much more will we not escape who turn away from him who warns from heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice shook the earth, then, but now he has promised, saying, "Yet once more will I shake not only the earth, but also the heavens."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This phrase, "Yet once more," signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, receiving a kingdom that can`t be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well pleasing to God, with reverence and awe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
