Then they brought these men before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nebuchadnezzar answered them, Is it on purpose, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that you don`t serve my god, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now if you are ready whenever you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipe, and all kinds of music to you fall down and worship the image which I have made, [well]: but if you don`t worship, you shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered the king, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If it be [so], our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: [therefore] he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He commanded certain mighty men who were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, [and] to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then these men were bound in their pants, their tunics, and their mantles, and their [other] garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore because the king`s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire killed those men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spoke and said to his counselors, Didn`t we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered the king, True, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered, Look, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, you servants of the Most High God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king`s counselors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their pants changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants who trusted in him, and have changed the king`s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other god who is able to deliver after this sort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
