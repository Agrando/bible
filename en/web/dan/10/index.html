When he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he to me, Don`t be afraid, Daniel; for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard: and I am come for your words` sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days; but, behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for [many] days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when he had spoken to me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was mute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke and said to him who stood before me, my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I retain no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, immediately there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He said, "Greatly beloved man, don`t be afraid: peace be to you, be strong, yes, be strong."     When he spoke to me, I was strengthened, and said, "Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he said, "Do you know why I have come to you? Now I will return to fight with the prince of Persia. When I go forth, behold, the prince of Greece shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will tell you that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none who holds with me against these, but Michael your prince."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
