So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These great animals, which are four, are four kings, who shall arise out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth animal, which was diverse from all of them, exceedingly terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other [horn] which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I saw, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus he said, The fourth animal shall be a fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole the sky, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Here is the end of the matter. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my face was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
