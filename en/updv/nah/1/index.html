The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Yahweh is a jealous God and avenges; Yahweh avenges and is full of wrath; Yahweh takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserves [wrath] for his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yahweh is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means leave unpunished [the guilty]: Yahweh has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languishes, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth arose at his presence, yes, the world, and all that dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Who can stand before his indignation? And who can arise in the fierceness of his anger? His wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken apart by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yahweh is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knows those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But with an overrunning flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What do you{+} devise against Yahweh? He will make a full end; affliction will not rise up the second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For entangled like thorns, and drunk as with their drink, they are consumed completely as dry stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>One has gone forth out of you, that devises evil against Yahweh, that counsels wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says Yahweh: Though they are in full strength, and likewise many, even so they will be cut down, and he will pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now I will break his yoke from off you, and will burst your bonds in sunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Yahweh has given commandment concerning you, that no more of your name will be sown: out of the house of your gods I will cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make your grave; for you have not measured up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Look, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good news, that publishes peace! Keep your feasts, O Judah, perform your vows; for the wicked one will no more pass through you; he is completely cut off.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
