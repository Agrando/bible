let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Yahweh comes, for it is near at hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread on the mountains; a great and a strong people; there has not ever been the like, neither will [there] be anymore after them, even to the years of many generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A fire devours before them; and behind them a flame burns: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yes, and none has escaped them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so they run.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they do not proceed in a confused manner on their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Neither does one thrust another; they march every [able-bodied] man in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and don't break off [their course].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They leap on the city; they run on the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The earth quakes before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Yahweh utters his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executes his word; for the day of Yahweh is great and very awesome; and who can endure it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yet even now, says Yahweh, turn{+} to me with all your{+} heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and rend your{+} heart, and not your{+} garments, and turn to Yahweh your{+} God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in loving-kindness, and repents of the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who knows whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering to Yahweh your{+} God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those who are nursed by the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare your people, O Yahweh, and don't give your heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: why should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Yahweh was jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Yahweh answered and said to his people, Look, I will send you{+} grain, and new wine, and oil, and you{+} will be satisfied with them; and I will no more make you{+} a reproach among the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but I will remove far off from you{+} the northern [army], and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench will come up, and its ill savor will come up, because it has done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Don't be afraid, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Yahweh has done great things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Don't be afraid, you{+} beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree bears its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine yield their strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be glad then, you{+} sons of Zion, and rejoice in Yahweh your{+} God; for he gives you{+} the former rain in just measure, and he causes to come down for you{+} the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first [month].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the floors will be full of wheat, and the vats will overflow with new wine and oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will restore to you{+} the years that the locust has eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you{+} will eat in plenty and be satisfied, and will praise the name of Yahweh your{+} God, that has dealt wondrously with you{+}; and my people will never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you{+} will know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Yahweh your{+} God, and there is no other; and my people will never be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it will come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; and your{+} sons and your{+} daughters will prophesy, your{+} old men will dream dreams, your{+} young men will see visions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and also on the male slaves and on the female slaves in those days I will pour out my Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and awesome day of Yahweh comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it will come to pass, that whoever will call on the name of Yahweh will be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, as Yahweh has said, and among the remnant those whom Yahweh calls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
