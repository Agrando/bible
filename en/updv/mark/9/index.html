How long shall I bear with you{+}? Bring him to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, immediately the spirit tore him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he asked his father, How much time is it since this has come to him? And he said, From a child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And often it has cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if you can do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus said to him, If you can! All things are possible to him who believes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Immediately the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help my unbelief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Jesus saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter into him no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and [the boy] became as one dead; insomuch that most said, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he came into the house, his disciples asked him privately, [How is it] that we could not cast it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, This kind can come out by nothing, except by prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they went forth from there, and passed through Galilee; and he did not want that any man should know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he taught his disciples, and said to them, The Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they didn't understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were you{+} reasoning on the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on the way, who [was] the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he says to them, If any man would be first, he will be last of all, and servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took a little child, and set the child among them: and taking the child in his arms, he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whoever will receive one of such little children in my name, receives me: and whoever receives me, does not receive me, but him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>John said to him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he didn't follow us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said, Don't forbid him: for there is no man who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For he who is not against us is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For whoever will give you{+} a cup of water to drink, because you{+} are Christ's, truly I say to you{+}, he will in no way lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And whoever will cause one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were put around his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out: it is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For everyone will be salted with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good: but if the salt has lost its saltness, how will you{+} season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
