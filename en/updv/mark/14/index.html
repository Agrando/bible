And they murmured against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said, Let her alone; why do you{+} trouble her? She has worked a good work on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For you{+} always have the poor with you{+}, and whenever you{+} want you{+} can do them good: but me you{+} do not always have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for the burying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And truly I say to you{+}, Wherever the good news will be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judas Iscariot, he who was one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him [to them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover, his disciples say to him, Where do you want us to go and make ready that you may eat the Passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, Go into the city, and there will meet you{+} a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and wherever he will enter in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is my guest-chamber, where I will eat the Passover with my disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will himself show you{+} a large upper room furnished [and] ready: and there make ready for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said to them: and they made ready the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when it was evening he comes with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as they sat and were eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you{+}, One of you{+} will deliver me up, [even] he who eats with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one, Is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to them, [It is] one of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him: but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up! [It would have been] good for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he broke it, and gave to them, and said, Take{+}: this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly I say to you{+}, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus says to them, All you{+} will be offended: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Nevertheless, after I am raised up, I will go before you{+} into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter said to him, Although all will be offended, yet I will not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus says to him, Truly I say to you, that you today, [even] this night, before the rooster crows twice, will deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he spoke exceedingly vehemently, If I must die with you, I will definitely not deny you. And in like manner also they all said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they come to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he says to his disciples, Sit{+} here, while I pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and very troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he says to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful even to death: stay{+} here, and watch{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to you; remove this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but what you will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Couldn't you watch one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Watch and pray, that you{+} don't enter into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they didn't know what to answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he comes the third time, and says to them, Are you{+} still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come; look, the Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Arise, let us be going: look, he who delivers me up is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately, while he yet spoke, comes Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now he that delivered him up had given them a token, saying, Whomever I will kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he came, immediately he came to him, and says, Rabbi; and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they laid hands on him, and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Have you{+} come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I was daily with you{+} in the temple teaching, and you{+} didn't take me: but [this is done] that the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they all left him, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over [his] naked [body]: and they lay hold on him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and there come together all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Peter had followed him far off, even inside, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the attendants, and warming himself in the light [of the fire].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin sought witness against Jesus to put him to death; and did not find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For many bore false witness against him, and their witness didn't agree together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And there stood up some, and bore false witness against him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And even so their witness did not agree together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And the high priest stood up in the middle [of the Sanhedrin], and asked Jesus, saying, Do you answer nothing? What is it which these witness against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and says to him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Jesus said, I am: and you{+} will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the high priest rent his clothes, and says, What further need do we have of witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>You{+} have heard the blasphemy: what do you{+} think? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the attendants received him with blows of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as Peter was beneath in the court, there comes one of the female slaves of the high priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked on him, and says, You also were with the Nazarene, [even] Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what you say: and he went out into the porch; and the rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And the slave saw him, and she began again to say to those who stood by, This is [one] of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he again denied it. And after a little while again those who stood by said to Peter, of a truth you are [one] of them; for you are a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>But he began to curse, and to swear, I don't know this man of whom you{+} speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And right away the second time the rooster crowed. And Peter called to mind the word, how that Jesus said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me thrice. And when he thought on it, he wept.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
