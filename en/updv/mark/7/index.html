Don't you{+} perceive, that whatever from outside goes into the man, [it] can't defile him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because it does not go into his heart, but into his belly, and goes out into the latrine? [This he said], making all meats clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from inside, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>greed, wickednesses, deceit, sexual immorality, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>all these evil things proceed from inside, and defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And from there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But right away a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she implored him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But she answered and says to him, Lord, even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And she went away to her house, and found the child laid on the bed, and the demon gone out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the borders of Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they bring to him one who was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they urge him to lay his hand on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well; he makes even the deaf to hear, and the mute to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
