I adjure you by God, don't torment me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he said to him, Come forth, you unclean spirit, out of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he asked him, What is your name? And he says to him, My name is Legion; for we are many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he implored him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there was there on the mountain side a great herd of swine being shepherded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they implored him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the sea, [in number] about two thousand; and they were drowned in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And those who shepherded them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they came to see what it was that had come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come to Jesus, and look at him who was possessed with demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, [even] him who had the legion: and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those who saw it declared to them how it befell him who was possessed with demons, and concerning the swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they began to urge him to depart from their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed with demons implored him that he might be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he did not allow him, but says to him, Go to your house to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and [how] he had mercy on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he went his way, and began to publish in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him: and all men marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name; and seeing him, he falls at his feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and implores him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death: [I pray you], that you come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made whole, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he went with him; and a great multitude followed him, and they thronged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And a woman, who had a discharge of blood twelve years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and had not been getting better, but rather grew worse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>having heard about Jesus, came in the crowd behind, and touched his garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For she said, If I touch but his garments, I will be made whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power [proceeding] from him had gone forth, turned him about in the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his disciples said to him, You see the multitude thronging you, and you say, Who touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he looked around to see her who had done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace, and be whole of your plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While he yet spoke, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's [house] saying, Your daughter is dead: why do you trouble the Teacher any further?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Don't be afraid, only believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he allowed no man to follow with him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they come to the house of the ruler of the synagogue; and he sees a tumult, and [many] weeping and wailing greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when he had entered in, he says to them, Why do you{+} make a tumult, and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all forth, takes the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him, and goes in where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And taking the child by the hand, he says to her, Talitha koum; which is, being interpreted, Girl, I say to you, Arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And immediately the girl rose up, and walked; for she was twelve years old. And they were amazed immediately with a great amazement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he charged them much that no man should know this: and he commanded that [something] should be given her to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
