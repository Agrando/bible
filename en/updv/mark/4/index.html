And there is gathered to him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he taught them many things in parables, and said to them in his teaching,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Listen: Look, the sower went forth to sow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and it came to pass, as he sowed, some [seed] fell by the wayside, and the birds came and devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And other [seed] fell on the rocky [ground], where it did not have much earth; and right away it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And other [seed] fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said to them, To you{+} is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he says to them, Do you{+} not know this parable? And how will you{+} know all the parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower sows the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are those by the wayside, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, right away Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these are those who are sown on the rocky [places], who, when they have heard the word, right away receive it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they have no root in themselves, but endure for awhile; then, when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word, right away they stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And others are those who are sown among the thorns; these are those who have heard the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the cares of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those are the ones who were sown on the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, [and] not to be put on the lampstand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hid, except that it should be manifested; neither was [anything] made secret, but that it should come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, Take heed what you{+} hear: with what measure you{+} mete it will be measured to you{+}; and more will be given to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he who has, to him will be given: and he who has not, from him will be taken away even that which he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn't know how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The earth bears fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit is [ready to] deliver, right away he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or in what parable shall we set it forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under its shadow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and without a parable he did not speak to them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on that day, when evening came, he says to them, Let us go over to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there rises a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they wake him, and say to him, Teacher, don't you care that we perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said to them, Why are you{+} fearful? Have you{+} not yet faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
