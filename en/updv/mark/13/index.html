There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And as he sat on the mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell us, when will these things be? And what [will be] the sign when these things are all about to be accomplished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus began to say to them, Take heed that no man leads you{+} astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Many will come in my name, saying, I am [he]; and will lead many astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when you{+} will hear of wars and rumors of wars, don't be troubled: [these things] must surely come to pass; but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in diverse places; there will be famines: these things are the beginning of travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you{+} take heed to yourselves. They will deliver you{+} up to Sanhedrins; and in synagogues you{+} will be beaten; and before governors and kings you{+} will stand for my sake, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the good news must first be preached to all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they lead you{+} [to judgment], and deliver you{+} up, don't be anxious beforehand what you{+} will speak: but whatever will be given you{+} in that hour, that speak{+}; for it is not you{+} who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child; and children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you{+} will be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when you{+} see the detestable thing of desolation standing where it ought not (let him who reads understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And pray{+} that it is not in the winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For those days will be tribulation, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And except Yahweh had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the elect's sake, whom he chose, he shortened the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And then if any man will say to you{+}, Look, here is the Christ; or, Look, there; don't believe [it]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for there will arise false Christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But take{+} heed: I have told you{+} all things beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then he will send forth the angels, and will gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you{+} know that the summer is near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>even so you{+} also, when you{+} see these things coming to pass, know{+} that it is near, [even] at the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Truly I say to you{+}, This generation will not pass away, until all these things be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Heaven and earth will pass away: but my words will definitely not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But of that day or that hour knows no one, not even the angels in heaven nor even the Son, but the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Take{+} heed, watch{+}: for you{+} don't know when the time is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[It is] as [when] a man, sojourning in another country, having left his house, and given authority to his slaves, to each one his work, commanded also the porter to watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Watch therefore: for you{+} don't know when the lord of the house comes, whether at evening, or at midnight, or at rooster crowing, or in the morning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>lest coming suddenly he find you{+} sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what I say to you{+} I say to all, Watch.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
