And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he would not allow that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he taught, and said to them, Is it not written, My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you{+} have made it a den of robbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when evening came they went forth out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter calling to remembrance says to him, Rabbi, look, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answering says to them, Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Truly I say to you{+}, Whoever will say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea; and will not doubt in his heart, but will believe that what he says comes to pass; he will have it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I say to you{+}, All things that you{+} pray and ask for, believe that you{+} receive them, and you{+} will have them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whenever you{+} stand praying, forgive, if you{+} have anything against anyone; that your{+} Father also who is in heaven may forgive you{+} your{+} trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and they said to him, By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus said to them, I will ask of you{+} one question, and answer me, and I will tell you{+} by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we will say, From heaven; He will say, Why then did you{+} not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But should we say, From men--they feared the multitude: for all truly held John to be a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they answered Jesus and say, We don't know. And Jesus says to them, Neither do I tell you{+} by what authority I do these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
