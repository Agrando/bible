And [since] they had nothing to eat, he called the disciples, [and] says to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and if I send them away fasting to their home, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And his disciples answered him, From where will one be able to fill these men with bread here in a desert place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he asked them, How many loaves do you{+} have? And they said, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he commands the multitude to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke, and gave to his disciples, to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they had a few small fish: and having blessed them, he commanded to set these also before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they ate, and were filled: and they took up, of broken pieces that remained over, seven baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they were about four thousand: and he sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And right away he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, trying him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and says, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you{+}, There will no sign be given to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he left them, and again entering into [the boat] departed to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they forgot to take bread; and they did not have in the boat with them more than one loaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they discussed one with another that they have no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus perceiving it says to them, Why discuss that you{+} have no bread? Do you{+} not yet perceive, neither understand? Do you{+} have your{+} heart hardened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Having eyes, don't you{+} see? And having ears, don't you{+} hear? And don't you{+} remember?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you{+} take up? They say to him, Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When [I broke] the seven among the four thousand, how many basketfuls of broken pieces did you{+} take up? And they say to him, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to them, Do you{+} not yet understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they come to Bethsaida. And they bring to him a blind man, and urge him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village; and when he had spit on his eyes, and laid his hands on him, he asked him, Do you see anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he looked up, and said, I see men; for I see [them] as trees, walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then again he laid his hands on his eyes; and he looked steadfastly, and was restored, and saw all things clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he sent him away to his home, saying, Do not even enter into the village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus went forth, and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea Philippi: and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they told him, saying, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; but others, One of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he asked them, But who do you{+} say that I am? Peter answers and says to him, You are the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he began to teach them, that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he spoke the saying openly. And Peter took him, and began to rebuke him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he turning about, and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, and says, Get behind me, Satan; for you do not mind the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he called to him the multitude with his disciples, and said to them, If any man wants to follow after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it; and whoever will lose his life for the sake of me and the good news will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, and forfeit his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For what should a man give in exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For whoever will be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man also will be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
