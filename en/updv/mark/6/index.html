And, What [is] the wisdom that is given to this man, and [what is the meaning of] such mighty works being done by his hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Isn't this the son of the carpenter and Mary, and the brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he could there do no mighty work, except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he marveled because of their unbelief. And he went around the surrounding villages teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he calls to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he charged them that they should take nothing for [their] journey, except a staff only; no bread, no bag, no money in their belt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but [he said], fasten on sandals and don't put on two coats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, Wherever you{+} enter into a house, stay there until you{+} depart from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whatever place will not receive you{+}, and they do not hear you{+}, as you{+} go forth from there, shake off the dust that is under your{+} feet for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went out, and preached that [men] should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And King Herod heard [of it], for his name had become known. And they said, John the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore do these powers work in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But others said, It is Elijah. And others said, [It is] a prophet, [even] as one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Herod, when he heard [of it], said, John, whom I beheaded, he is risen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold on John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; for he had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him; and she could not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was much perplexed; and he heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when a convenient day came, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords, and the generals, and the chief men of Galilee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those who sat to eat with him; the king said to the girl, Ask of me whatever you will, and I will give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he emphatically swore to her, Whatever you will ask of me, I will give it you, to the half of my kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she went out, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she came in right away in a hurry to the king, and asked, saying, I want that you forthwith give me on a platter the head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king was exceedingly sorry; but for the sake of his oaths, and of those who sat to eat, he would not reject her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And right away the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring his head: and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when his disciples heard [of it], they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the apostles gather themselves together to Jesus; and they told him all things that they had done, and that they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he says to them, You{+} come yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest awhile. For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And [the people] saw them going, and many knew [them], and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came to him, and said, The place is desert, and the day is now far spent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves something to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he answered and said to them, You{+} give them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy $20,000 worth of bread, and give them to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he says to them, How many loaves do you{+} have? Go [and] see. And when they knew, they say, Five, and two fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he commanded them that all should sit down by companies on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves; and he gave to his disciples to set before them; and the two fish he divided among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they all ate, and were filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they took up broken pieces, twelve basketfuls, and also of the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And right away he constrained his disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before [him] to the other side to Bethsaida, while he himself sends the multitude away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And after he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them, walking on the sea; and he would have passed by them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and says to them, Be of good cheer: it is I; don't be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased: and they were very amazed in themselves beyond measure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for they didn't understand concerning the loaves, but their heart was hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land to Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they had come out of the boat, immediately [the people] knew him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and ran around that whole region, and began to carry about on their beds those who were sick, where they heard he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and implored him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
