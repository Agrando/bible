To save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when he had looked around on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch forth [your] hand. And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Pharisees went out, and right away with the Herodians gave counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed on him that they might touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirits, whenever they looked at him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he charged them much that they should not make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he goes up into the mountain, and calls to him whom he himself wanted; and they went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to cast out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he appointed the twelve: and he gave the name Peter to Simon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he gave them the name Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he comes into a house. And the multitude comes together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebul, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom can't stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But no one can enter into the house of the strong [man], and spoil his goods, except he first binds the strong [man]; and then he will spoil his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly I say to you{+}, All their sins will be forgiven to the sons of men, and their blasphemies by whichever they will blaspheme:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but whoever will blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And his mother and his brothers come; and, standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say to him, Look, your mother and your brothers and your sisters outside seek for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he answers them, and says, Who is my mother and my brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking around on those who sat around him, he says, Here are my mother and my brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever will do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
