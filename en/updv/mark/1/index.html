Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the report of him went out right away everywhere into all the region around Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And right away, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and right away they tell him of her:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And at evening, when the sun set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many who were sick with diverse diseases, and cast out many demons; and he didn't allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and those who were with him followed after him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they found him, and say to him, All are seeking you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end I came forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there comes to him a leper, imploring him, and kneeling down, and saying to him, If you will, you can make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and says to him, I will; be made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he strictly charged him, and immediately sent him out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and says to him, See [that] you say nothing to any man: but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
