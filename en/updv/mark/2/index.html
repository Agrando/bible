He blasphemes. Who can forgive sins but one, God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned to themselves, says to them, Why do you{+} reason these things in your{+} hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But that you{+} may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he says to the sick of the palsy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say to you, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he arose, and immediately took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he went forth again by the seaside; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as he passed by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the place of toll, and he says to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it comes to pass, that he was sitting at meat in his house, and many publicans and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and publicans, said to his disciples, [How is it] that he eats with publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Jesus heard it, he says to them, Those who are whole have no need of a physician, but those who are sick: I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come and say to him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No man sews a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that which should fill it up takes from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no man puts new wine into old wineskins; else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine perishes, and the skins: but [they put] new wine into fresh wineskins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharisees said to him, Look, why do they do on the Sabbath day that which is not lawful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he says to them, Did you{+} never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and those who were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the showbread, which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so that the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
