None is good but one, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to him, Teacher, all these things I have observed from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus looking on him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one who had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus looked around, and says to his disciples, How hardly will those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answers again, and says to them, Children, how hard it is to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were exceedingly astonished, saying to themselves, Then who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus looking on them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Peter began to say to him, Look, we have left all, and have followed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said, Truly I say to you{+}, There is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me, and for the sake of the good news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but he [who] will receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many [who are] first will be last; and the last first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were on the way, going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus was going before them: and they were amazed; and those who followed were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them the things that were to happen to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>[saying], Look, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and the scribes; and they will condemn him to death, and will deliver him to the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and they will mock him, and will spit on him, and will scourge him, and will kill him; and after three days he will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And there come near to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying to him, Teacher, we want that you should do for us whatever we will ask of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to them, What do you{+} want that I should do for you{+}?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they said to him, Grant to us that we may sit, one on your right hand, and one on [your] left hand, in your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said to them, You{+} don't know what you{+} ask. Are you{+} able to drink the cup that I drink? Or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink you{+} will drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized with that you{+} will be baptized:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but to sit at my right hand or at [my] left hand is not mine to give; but [it is for them] for whom it has been prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard it, they began to be moved with indignation concerning James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus called them to him, and says to them, You{+} know that they who are accounted to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them; and their great ones exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But it is not so among you{+}: but whoever would become great among you{+}, will be your{+} servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever would be first among you{+}, will be slave of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For the Son of Man also didn't come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they come to Jericho: and as he went out from Jericho, with his disciples and a great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the wayside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Jesus stood still, and said, Call{+} him. And they call the blind man, saying to him, Be of good cheer: rise, he calls you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he, casting away his garment, sprang up, and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answered him, and said, What do you want that I should do to you? And the blind man said to him, Rabboni, that I may receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
