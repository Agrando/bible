And they turned and said, Like Yahweh of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I saw in the night, and, look, a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I said, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show you what these are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the man who stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are those whom Yahweh has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they answered the angel of Yahweh who stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, look, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the angel of Yahweh answered and said, O Yahweh of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these seventy years?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Yahweh answered the angel that talked with me with good words, [even] comfortable words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the angel that talked with me said to me, Cry out, saying, Thus says Yahweh of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I am very intensely displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh: I have returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house will be built in it, says Yahweh of hosts, and a line will be stretched forth over Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Cry out yet again, saying, Thus says Yahweh of hosts: My cities will yet overflow with prosperity; and Yahweh will yet comfort Zion, and will yet choose Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and saw four horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said to the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Yahweh showed me four blacksmiths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I said, What do these come to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man lifted up his head; but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
