Even so the things of God none knows, except the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But we received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is from God; that we might know the things that were freely given to us of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Spirit teaches; combining spiritual things with spiritual [words].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him; and he can't know them, because they are spiritually judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he who is spiritual judges all things, and he himself is judged of no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he should instruct him?
