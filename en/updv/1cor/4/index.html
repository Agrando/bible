And what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you glory as if you had not received it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Already you{+} are filled, already you{+} have become rich, you{+} have come to reign without us: yes and I would that you{+} did reign, that we also might reign with you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, both to angels and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you{+} are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you{+} are strong; you{+} have glory, but we have dishonor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I do not write these things to shame you{+}, but to admonish you{+} as my beloved children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For though you{+} have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet [you{+} have] not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I begot you{+} through the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I urge you{+} therefore, be{+} imitators of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For this cause I have sent to you{+} Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will put you{+} in remembrance of my ways which are in Christ Jesus, even as I teach everywhere in every church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I will come to you{+} shortly, if the Lord wills; and I will know, not the word of those who are puffed up, but the power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What do you{+} want? Shall I come to you{+} with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
