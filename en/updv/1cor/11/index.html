Or do you{+} despise the church of God, and put them to shame that do not have? What shall I say to you{+}? Shall I praise you{+}? In this I do not praise you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you{+}, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was delivered up took bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, This is my body, which is for you{+}: this do in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as you{+} drink [it], in remembrance of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you{+} eat this bread, and drink the cup, you{+} proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore whoever will eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself, if he does not discern the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause many among you{+} are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged by the Lord, we are chastened, that we may not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, my brothers, when you{+} come together to eat, wait one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your{+} coming together not be to judgment. And the rest I will set in order whenever I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
