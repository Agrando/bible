And what is Paul? Servants through whom you{+} believed; and to each as the Lord gave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So then neither is he who plants anything, neither he who waters; but God who gives the increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now he who plants and he who waters are one: but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For we are God's coworkers: you{+} are God's husbandry, God's building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another builds on it. But let each take heed how he builds on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For another foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if any man builds on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>each man's work will be made manifest: for the day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will prove each man's work of what sort it is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If any man's work that he built on it stays, he will receive a reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If any man's work will be burned, he will suffer loss: but he himself will be saved; yet so as through fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Don't you{+} know that you{+} are a temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you{+}?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man destroys the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinks that he is wise among you{+} in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and again, The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are useless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours{+};</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours{+};</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and you{+} are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
