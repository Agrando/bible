For what reason did I preach the good news to you{+}? Unless you{+} hold fast [to it], you{+} believed for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I delivered to you{+} first of all that which also I received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and that he was buried; and that he has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part stay until now, but some have fallen asleep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and last of all, as to the [child] untimely born, he appeared to me also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than all of them: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Whether then [it is] I or they, so we preach, and so you{+} believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if Christ is preached that he has been raised from the dead, how do some say among you{+} that there is no resurrection of the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is also vain, [and] your{+} faith is also vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yes, we are found false witnesses of God; because we witnessed of God that he raised up Christ: whom he did not raise up, if indeed the dead are not raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the dead are not raised, neither has Christ been raised:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if Christ has not been raised, your{+} faith [is] useless; you{+} are yet in your{+} sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they also that have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who are asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since by man [came] death, by man [came] also the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits; then those who are Christ's, at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then [comes] the end, when he will deliver up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he must reign, until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy that will be abolished is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, He put all things in subjection under his feet. But when he says, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when all things have been subjected to him, then will the Son also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him, that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I protest by that glorifying in you{+}, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Don't be deceived: Evil company corrupts good morals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Awake to soberness righteously, and don't sin; for some have no knowledge of God: I speak [this] to move you{+} to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But some one will say, How are the dead raised? And with what manner of body do they come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not quickened except it dies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and that which you sow, you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some other kind;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one [flesh] of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the [glory] of the terrestrial is another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>it is sown in shame; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [body].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul. The last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Nevertheless that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man is of the earth, made of dust: the second man is of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As is the earthly, such are they also who are earthly: and as is the heavenly, such are they also who are heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have borne the image of the earthly, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood can't inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Look, I tell you{+} a mystery: We all will not sleep, but we will all be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption, and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>but thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Therefore, my beloved brothers, be{+} steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, since you{+} know that your{+} labor is not vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
