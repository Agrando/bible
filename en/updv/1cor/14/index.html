For you{+} will be speaking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no [kind] is without significance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If then I don't know the meaning of the voice, I will be to him who speaks a barbarian, and he who speaks will be a barbarian to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So also you{+}, since you{+} are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that you{+} may abound to the edifying of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or else if you bless in the spirit, how will he that fills the place of the unlearned say the Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he doesn't know what you say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I thank God, I speak with tongues more than all of you{+}:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>nevertheless in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, don't be children in mind: yet in malice be{+} babes, but in mind be men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people; and not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying [is for a sign], not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If therefore the whole church is assembled together and all speak with tongues, and unlearned or unbelieving men come in, will they not say that you{+} are insane?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and an unbelieving or unlearned one comes in, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you{+} indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>What is it then, brothers? When you{+} come together, each has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any man speaks in a tongue, [let it be] by two, or at the most three, and [that] in turn; and let one interpret:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And let the prophets speak [by] two or three, and let the others discern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first keep silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you{+} can all prophesy one at a time, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for God is not [a God] of confusion, but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>let the women keep silent in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also the law says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if they want to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What? Was it from you{+} that the word of God went forth? Or did it come to you{+} alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write to you{+}, that they are the commandment of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any man ignores [this], he is [to be] ignored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But let all things be done decently and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
