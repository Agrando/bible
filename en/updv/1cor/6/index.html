And if the world is judged by you{+}, are you{+} unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Don't you{+} know that we will judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If then you{+} have to judge things pertaining to this life, do you{+} set them to judge who are of no account in the church?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I say [this] to move you{+} to shame. What, can't there be [found] among you{+} one wise man who will be able to decide between his brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore already it is altogether a defect in you{+}, that you{+} have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>No, but you{+} yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that [your{+}] brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or don't you{+} know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don't be deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, will inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And such were some of you{+}: but you{+} were washed, but you{+} were sanctified, but you{+} were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God will bring to nothing both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up as through his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Don't you{+} know that your{+} bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a prostitute? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or don't you{+} know that he who sticks to the prostitute is one body? For, The two, he says, will become one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he who sticks to the Lord is one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is outside the body; but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or don't you{+} know that your{+} body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you{+}, which you{+} have from God? And you{+} are not your{+} own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for you{+} were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your{+} body.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
