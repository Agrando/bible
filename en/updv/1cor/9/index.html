Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not you{+} my work in the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If to others I am not an apostle, yet at least I am to you{+}; for the seal of my apostleship are you{+} in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My defense to those who examine me is this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Do we have no right to eat and to drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Do we have no right to lead about a wife who is a sister, even as the rest of the apostles, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Or only I and Barnabas, do we not have a right to forbear working?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What soldier ever serves at his own charges? Who plants a vineyard, and does not eat its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock, and does not eat of the milk of the flock?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Do I speak these things after the manner of men or doesn't the law also say the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is written in the law of Moses, You will not muzzle the ox when he treads out the corn. Is it for the oxen that God cares,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>or does he say it assuredly for our sake? Yes, for our sake it was written: because he who plows ought to plow in hope, and he who threshes, [to thresh] in hope of partaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we sowed to you{+} spiritual things, is it a great matter if we will reap your{+} carnal things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If others partake of [this] right over you{+}, do not we yet more? Nevertheless we did not use this right; but we bear all things, that we may cause no hindrance to the good news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Don't you{+} know that those who work about sacred things eat [of] the things of the temple, [and] those who wait on the altar have their portion with the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Even so the Lord directed that those who proclaim the good news should live of the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have used none of these things: and I do not write these things that it may be so done in my case; for [it was] good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorifying void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if I preach the good news, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid on me; for woe is to me, if I do not preach the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if I participate in this of my own will, I have a reward: but if not of my own will, I have a stewardship entrusted to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What then is my reward? That, when I preach the good news, I may make the good news without charge, so as not to use to the full my right in the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For though I was free from all [men,] I became a slave to all, that I might gain the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, not being myself under the law, that I might gain those who are under the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to those who are without the law, as without the law, not being without the law of God, but under the law of Christ, that I might gain those who are without the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak: I have become all things to all men, that I may by all means save some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I do all things for the sake of the good news, that I may be a copartner of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Don't you{+} know that those running in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Even so run; that you{+} may attain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And every man who strives in the games exercises self-control in all things. Now they [do it] to receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so I fight, not as beating the air:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but I buffet my body, and bring it into slavery: lest by any means, after I have preached to others, I myself should be disapproved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
