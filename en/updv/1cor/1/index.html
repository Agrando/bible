Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For seeing that in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom didn't know God, it was God's good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Gentiles foolishness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For look at your{+} calling, brothers, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, [are called]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but God chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame those who are wise; and God chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, God chose, the things that are not, that he might bring to nothing the things that are:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that no flesh should glory before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But of him are you{+} in Christ Jesus, who was made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that, according to as it is written, He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
