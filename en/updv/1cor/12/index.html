If the whole is hearing, where is the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if there is only one member, where is the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now there are many members, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the eye can't say to the hand, I have no need of you: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and those [parts] of the body, which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whereas our comely [parts] have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that [part] which lacked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you{+} are the body of Christ, and severally members of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And God has set some in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, [diverse] kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all [workers of] miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way I show to you{+}.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
