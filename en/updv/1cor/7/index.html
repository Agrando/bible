Nevertheless each has his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they stay even as I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if they don't have self-control, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But to the married I give charge, [yes] not I, but the Lord, That the wife is not to depart from her husband,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>but should she depart, let her stay unmarried, or let her be reconciled to her husband; and that the husband is not to leave his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she gives her approval to dwell with him, let him not leave her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if any wife has an unbelieving husband, and he gives his approval to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the unbelieving husband has been accepted in the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been accepted in the brother: otherwise your{+} children would be unaccepted; but as it is they are accepted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet if the unbelieving departs, let him depart: the brother or the sister has not been bound in such [cases]: but God has called you{+} in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Only as the Lord has distributed to each, as God has called each, so let him walk. And so I direct in all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Has any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Let each stay in that calling in which he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Were you called being a slave? Do not care for it: no, even if you can become free, use [it] rather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For he who was called in the Lord being a slave, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he who was called being free, is Christ's slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>You{+} were bought with a price; don't become slaves of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Brothers, let each, [in that calling] in which he was called, stay in this with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one who has obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is on us, [namely,] that it is good for a man to be as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Are you bound to a wife? Don't seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Don't seek a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But should you marry, you haven't sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Yet such will have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But this I say, brothers, the time is shortened, that from now on both those who have wives may be as though they had none;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and those who weep, as though they did not weep; and those who rejoice, as though they did not rejoice; and those who buy, as though they did not possess;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and those who use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I would have you{+} to be free from cares. He who is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but he who is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and is divided. [So] also the woman who is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she who is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And this I say for your{+} own profit; not that I may cast a snare on you{+}, but for that which is seemly, and that you{+} may attend on the Lord without distraction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if any man thinks that he behaves himself unseemly toward his virgin [daughter], if she is past the flower of her age, and if need so requires, let him do what he will; he does not sin; let them marry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power as concerning in his own heart, to keep his own virgin [daughter], will do well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So then both he who gives his own virgin [daughter] in marriage does well; and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>A wife is bound for as long as her husband lives; but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whom she wants; only in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But she is happier if she stays as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
