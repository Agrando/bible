Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one of the same place answered and said, And who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Saul's uncle said to him and to his attendant, Where did you{+} go? And he said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they were not found, we came to Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray you, what Samuel said to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys were found. But concerning the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he didn't tell him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and he said to the sons of Israel, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and I delivered you{+} out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you{+}:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but you{+} have this day rejected your{+} God, who himself saves you{+} out of all your{+} calamities and your{+} distresses; and you{+} have said to him, Surely set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your{+} tribes, and by your{+} thousands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families; and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son of Kish was taken: but when they sought him, he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a man to come here? And Yahweh answered, Look, he has hid himself among the baggage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they ran and fetched him from there; and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Samuel said to all the people, Do you{+} see him whom Yahweh has chosen, that there is none like him along all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, [Long] live the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him the host, whose hearts God had touched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But certain worthless fellows said, How will this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no present. But he held his peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
