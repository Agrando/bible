So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur, that is before Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and completely destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and the oxen, and the seconds, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not completely destroy them: but everything that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed completely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the word of Yahweh came to Samuel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, look, he set up for himself a monument, and turned, and passed on, and went down to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed be you of Yahweh: I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Samuel said, What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God; and the rest we have completely destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Samuel said to Saul, Wait, and I will tell you what Yahweh has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Samuel said, Though you were little in your own sight, weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel? And Yahweh anointed you king over Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, Go, and completely destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why then didn't you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil, and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have completely destroyed the Amalekites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel said, Does Yahweh have as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh? Look, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For rebellion is as the sin of fortune-telling, and stubbornness is as idolatry and talismans. Because you have rejected the word of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected you from being king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold on the skirt of his robe, and it rent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Samuel said to him, Yahweh has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to your fellow man, who is better than you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent; for he is not man, that he should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship Yahweh your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Samuel said, Bring{+} here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so will your mother be childless among women. And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Samuel didn't come to see Saul anymore until the day of his death; for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Yahweh repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
