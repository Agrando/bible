And they told him the words of the men of Jabesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words, and his anger was greatly kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, Whoever does not come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so it will be done to his oxen. And the dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he numbered them in Bezek; and the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to the messengers that came, Thus you{+} will say to the men of Jabesh-gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you{+} will have deliverance. And the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you{+}, and you{+} will do with us all that seems good to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that those who remained were scattered, so that not two of them were left together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the people said to Samuel, Who is he that said, Will Saul reign over us? Bring the men, that we may put them to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Saul said, There will not be a man put to death this day; for today Yahweh has wrought deliverance in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices of peace-offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
