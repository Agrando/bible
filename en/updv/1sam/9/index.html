And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the attendants with you, and arise, go seek the donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he passed through the hill-country of Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalishah, but they didn't find them: then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and they were not there: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they didn't find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his attendant that was with him, Come, and let us return, or else my father will leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to him, Look now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says surely comes to pass: now let us go there; perhaps he can tell us concerning our journey on which we go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Saul said to his attendant, But, look, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what do we have?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the attendant answered Saul again, and said, Look, I have in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: I will give that to the man of God, to tell us our way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he who is now called a Prophet was formerly called a Seer.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said Saul to his attendant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went to the city where the man of God was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they answered them, and said, He is; look, [he is] before you: hurry now, for he has come today into the city; for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>as soon as you{+} come into the city, you{+} will right away find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes, because he blesses the sacrifice; [and] afterward they who are invited will eat. Now therefore go{+} up; for at this time you{+} will find him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they went up to the city; [and] as they came inside the city, look, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land of Benjamin, and you will anoint him to be leader over my people Israel; and he will save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked on my people, because their cry has come to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Look, the man of whom I spoke to you! This same will have authority over my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray you, where the seer's house is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for you{+} will eat with me today: and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as for your donkeys being lost now these three days, don't set your mind on them; for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you, and for all your father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul answered and said, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then did you speak to me after this manner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Samuel took Saul and his attendant, and brought them into the guest-chamber, and made them sit in the chiefest place among those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you, of which I said to you, Set it by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it before Saul. And [Samuel] said, Look, that which has been reserved! Set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had come down from the high place into the city, he communed with Saul on the housetop.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Rise up, that I may send you away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the attendant to pass on before us (and he passed on), but you stand still first, that I may cause you to hear the word of God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
