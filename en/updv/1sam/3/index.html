And the word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to wax dim, so that he could not see),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was laying down [to sleep], in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark of God was;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here I am; for you called me. And he said, I didn't call; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Yahweh called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am; for you called me. And he answered, I didn't call, my son; lie down again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now Samuel did not yet know Yahweh, neither was the word of Yahweh yet revealed to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Yahweh called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am; for you called me. And Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the lad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down: and it will be, if he calls you, that you will say, Speak, Yahweh; for your slave hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak; for your slave hears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Yahweh said to Samuel, Look, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons cursed God, and he did not restrain them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house will not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Yahweh. And Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you? I pray you, don't hide it from me: God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Samuel told him every bit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is Yahweh: he will do what seems good to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did not let any of his words fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
