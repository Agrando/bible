And Saul had his spear in his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will strike David even to the wall. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him, and had departed from Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore Saul removed him from himself, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood in awe of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came in before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Saul said to David, Look, my elder daughter Merab, I will give her to you as wife: only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh's battles. For Saul said, Don't let my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, [or] my father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law to the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter, should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing was right in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore Saul said to David, You will this day be my son-in-law a second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Saul commanded his slaves, [saying], Commune with David secretly, and say, Look, the king has delight in you, and all his slaves love you: now therefore be the king's son-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Saul's slaves spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Does it seem to you{+} a light thing to be the king's son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the slaves of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Saul said, Thus you{+} will say to David, The king does not desire any dowry, but a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king's enemies. Now Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when his slaves told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king's son-in-law. And the days were not expired;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David; and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was David's enemy continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, as often as they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the slaves of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
