And the lad was ministering to Yahweh before Eli the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn't know Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the custom of the priests with the people was that, when any man offered a sacrifice, the priest's attendant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or cauldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took with it. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's attendant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say, No, but you will give it to me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh; for they despised the offering of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a lad, girded with a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you [Elkanah] seed of this woman in place of the petition which he asked of Yahweh. And they went to their own home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Yahweh visited Hannah, and she became pregnant, and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the lad Samuel grew before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, Why do you{+} do such things? For I hear of your{+} evil dealings from all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No, my sons; for the report that I hear is not good: you{+} make Yahweh's people to transgress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If a man sins against another man, God will judge him; but if a man sins against Yahweh, who will entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they didn't listen to the voice of their father, because Yahweh was minded to slay them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the lad Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh, and also with men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And a man of God came to Eli, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your father, when, in Egypt, they belonged to the house of Pharaoh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? And did I give to the house of your father all the offerings of the sons of Israel made by fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why do you{+} kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation, and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me forever: but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me will be lightly esteemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Look, the days are coming, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father's house, that there will not be an old man in your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you will see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth which [God] will give Israel; and there will not be an old man in your house forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the man of yours, [whom] I will not cut off from my altar, [will be] to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart; and all the increase of your house will die as men [before they become old].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And this will be the sign to you, that will come upon your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they will die both of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will raise myself up a faithful priest, that will do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he will walk before my anointed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it will come to pass, that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and will say, Put me, I pray you, into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
