Show us with which we will sent it to its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said, If you{+} send away the ark of the God of Israel, don't send it empty; but by all means return him a trespass-offering: then you{+} will be healed, and it will be known to you{+} why his hand is not removed from you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then they said, What will be the trespass-offering which we will return to him? And they said, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords of the Philistines; for the same plague was on all of you{+}, and on your{+} lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore you{+} will make images of your{+} tumors, and images of your{+} mice that mar the land; and you{+} will give glory to the God of Israel: perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you{+}, and from off your{+} gods, and from off your{+} land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Why then do you{+} harden your{+} hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had wrought wonderfully among them, didn't they let the people go, and they departed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore you{+} take and prepare a new cart, and two milch kine, on which there has come no yoke; and tie the kine to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and take the ark of Yahweh, and lay it on the cart; and put the jewels of gold, which you{+} return to him for a trespass-offering, in a coffer by its side; and send it away, that it may go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And see; if it goes up by the way of its own border to Beth-shemesh, then he has done us this great evil: but if not, then we will know that it is not his hand that struck us; it was a chance that happened to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the men did so, and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the kine took the straight way by the way to Beth-shemesh; they went along the highway, lowing as they went, and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border of Beth-shemesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the cart came into the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was a great stone: and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the kine for a burnt-offering to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Levites took down the ark of Yahweh, and the coffer that was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt-offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for a trespass-offering to Yahweh: for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified cities and of country villages, even to the great stone, on which they set down the ark of Yahweh, [which stone remains] to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he killed of the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of Yahweh, he killed of the people seventy men, fifty thousand men; and the people mourned, because Yahweh had struck the people with a great slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Beth-shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Yahweh, this holy God? And to whom will he go up from us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-jearim, saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Yahweh; come{+} down, and fetch it up to you{+}.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
