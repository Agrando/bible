And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but to Hannah he gave a special portion; for he loved Hannah, but Yahweh had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her rival provoked her intensely, to make her fret, because Yahweh had shut up her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do you weep? And why don't you eat? And why is your heart grieved? Am I not better to you than ten sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drank. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the door-post of the temple of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh, and wept intensely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Yahweh of hosts, if you will indeed look at the affliction of your slave, and remember me, and not forget your slave, but will give to your slave a man-child, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life, and no razor will come upon his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli was watching her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice wasn't heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Eli said to her, How long will you be drunk? Put your wine away from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drank neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Don't count your slave for a wicked woman; for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation I have spoken until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Let your slave find favor in your sight. So the woman went her way, and ate; and her countenance was no more [sad].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and worshiped before Yahweh, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah had sex with Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when the time came about, that Hannah became pregnant, and gave birth to a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Hannah didn't go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not go up] until the lad is weaned; and then I will bring him, that he may appear before Yahweh, and remain there forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems good to you; tarry until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word. So the woman tarried and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three-year-old bull, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh: and the lad was young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they slew the bull, and brought the lad to Eli.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood here by you, praying to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I prayed for this lad; and Yahweh has given me my petition which I asked of him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>therefore I also have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives he is granted to Yahweh. And he worshiped Yahweh there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
