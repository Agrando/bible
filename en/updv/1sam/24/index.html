Now David and his men were dwelling in the innermost parts of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the men of David said to him, Look, the day of which Yahweh said to you, Look, I will deliver your enemy into your hand, and you will do to him as it will seem good to you. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart struck him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to his men, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, Yahweh's anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is Yahweh's anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So David checked his men with these words, and did not allow them to rise against Saul. And Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David said to Saul, Why do you harken to the words of man, saying, Look, David seeks your hurt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Look, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh had delivered you today into my hand in the cave: and some bade me kill you; but [I] spared you; and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is Yahweh's anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover, my father, see, yes, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and didn't kill you, know and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I haven't sinned against you, though you hunt after my life to take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you; but my hand will not be on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes forth wickedness; but my hand will not be on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After whom has the king of Israel come out? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog, after a flea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you, and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to you evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you have declared this day how that you have dealt well with me, since when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand, you didn't kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away well? Therefore [may] Yahweh reward you good for that which you have done to me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And now, look, I know that you will surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And David swore to Saul. And Saul went home; but David and his men got up to the stronghold.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
