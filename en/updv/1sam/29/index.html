And Achish said to the princes of the Philistines, Isn't this David, the slave of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days, or [rather] these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell away [to me] to this day?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him; and the princes of the Philistines said to him, Make the man return, that he may go back to his place where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us: for how should this [fellow] reconcile himself to his lord? Should it not be with the heads of these men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Isn't this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, And David his ten thousands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Yahweh lives, you have been upright, and your going out and your coming in with me in the host is good in my sight; for I haven't found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day: nevertheless the lords don't favor you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you do not displease the lords of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to Achish, But what have I done? And what have you found in your slave so long as I have been before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Achish answered and said to David, I know that you are good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He will not go up with us to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore, rise up early in the morning with the slaves of your lord that came with you, and go to the town that I gave you{+}. And don't take the complaint to heart, because you are good in my sight. And as soon as you{+} are up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
