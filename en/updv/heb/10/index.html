Because the worshipers, having been once cleansed, would have had no more consciousness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But in those [sacrifices] there is a remembrance made of sins year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore when he comes into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering you did not want, But you prepared a body for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin you had no pleasure:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, Look, I have come (In the roll of the book it is written of me) To do your will, O God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Saying above, Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin you did not want, neither had pleasure in them (which are offered according to the law),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>then he has said, Look, I have come to do your will. He takes away the first, that he may establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By whose will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every priest indeed stands day by day ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, the which can never take away sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>from now on expecting until his enemies are made the footstool of his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after he has said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the covenant that I will make with them After those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws on their heart, And on their mind also I will write them; [then he says,]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and [having] a great priest over the house of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>let us draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having our body washed in pure water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>let us hold fast the confession of the unwavering hope; for he who promised is faithful:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and let us consider one another to provoke to love and good works;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting [one another]; and so much the more, as you{+} see the day drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness of fire which will devour the adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>A man who has set at nothing Moses' law dies without compassion on [the word of] two or three witnesses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>of how much sorer punishment, do you{+} think, he will be judged worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified a common thing, and has done despite to the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we know him who said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense. And again, The Lord will judge his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you{+} were enlightened, you{+} endured a great conflict of sufferings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>partly, being made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, becoming partners with those who were so used.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For you{+} both had compassion on those who were in bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your{+} possessions, knowing that you{+} yourselves have a better possession and a staying one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do not cast away therefore your{+} boldness, which has great recompense of reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For you{+} have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, you{+} may receive the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For yet a very little while, He who comes will come, and will not tarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But my righteous one will live by faith: And if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not of those who shrink back to perdition; but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
