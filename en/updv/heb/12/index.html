God deals with you{+} as with sons; for what son is there whom [his] father does not chasten?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if you{+} are without chastening, of which all have been made sharers, then you{+} are bastards, and not sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: and shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they indeed for a few days chastened [us] as seemed good to them; but he for [our] profit, that [we] may be partakers of his holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all chastening seems for the present not to be joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields peaceable fruit to those who have been exercised by it, [even the fruit] of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and make straight paths for your{+} feet, that that which is lame not be turned out of the way, but rather be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man will see the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>looking carefully lest [there be] any man who falls short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble [you{+}], and by it many be defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>lest [there be] any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For you{+} know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind [in his father,] though he sought it diligently with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For you{+} have not come to [a mount] that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which [voice] those who heard entreated that no word more should be spoken to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touches the mountain, it will be stoned;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and so fearful was the appearance, [that] Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but you{+} have come to mount Zion, and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to tens of thousands of angels in a festive gathering,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and to the church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jesus the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than [that of] Abel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>See that you{+} do not refuse him who speaks. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned [them] on earth, much more [will] we [not escape] who turn away from him who [warns] from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>whose voice then shook the earth: but now he has promised, saying, Yet once more I will make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this [word], Yet once more, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, receiving a kingdom that can't be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may offer service well-pleasing to God with reverence and awe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for our God is a consuming fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
