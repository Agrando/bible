Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>that Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they said to me, The remnant who are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and said, I urge you, O Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and awesome God, that keeps covenant and loving-kindness with those who love him and keep his commandments:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may listen to the prayer of your slave, which I pray before you at this time, day and night, for the sons of Israel your slaves while I confess the sins of the sons of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Yes, I and my father's house have sinned:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>we have dealt very corruptly against you, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which you commanded your slave Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remember, I urge you, the word that you commanded your slave Moses, saying, If you{+} trespass, I will scatter you{+} abroad among the peoples:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if you{+} return to me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your{+} outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet I will gather them from there, and will bring them to the place that I have chosen to make my name stay there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now these are your slaves and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>O Lord, I urge you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your slave, and to the prayer of your slaves, who delight to fear your name; and prosper, I pray you, your slave this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
