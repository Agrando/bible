And I held a great assembly against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, who were sold to the nations; and would you{+} even sell your{+} brothers, and should they be sold to us? Then they held their peace, and never found a word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also I said, The thing that you{+} do is not good: Shouldn't you{+} walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I likewise, my brothers and my attendants, lend them money and grain. I pray you{+}, let us leave off this usury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Restore, I pray you{+}, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that you{+} exact of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they said, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so we will do, even as you say. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Also I shook out my lap, and said, So may God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that does not perform this promise; even thus will he be shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Yahweh. And the people did according to this promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even to the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brothers have not eaten the bread of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the former governors who were before me were chargeable to the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yes, even their attendants bore rule over the people: but I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yes, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any land: and all my attendants were gathered there to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those who came to us from among the nations that were round about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I did not demand the bread of the governor, because the service was heavy on this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Remember to me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
