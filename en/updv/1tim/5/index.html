And, The worker is worthy of his wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Against an elder don't receive an accusation, except on [the basis of] two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Those who sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I charge [you] in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Lay hands hastily on no man, neither share in other men's sins: keep yourself pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Be no longer a drinker of water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your often infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Some men's sins are evident, going before to judgment; and some men also they follow after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In like manner also there are good works that are evident; and such that are otherwise can't be hid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
