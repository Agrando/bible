And it will be granted you: and what is your request? Even to the half of the kingdom it will be performed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given to me at my petition, and my people at my request:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for male slaves and female slaves, I would have held my peace, although the adversary could not have compensated for the king's damage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then King Ahasuerus spoke and said to Esther the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that dared presume in his heart to do so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Esther said, An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman.

Then said the king, Will he even force the queen before me in the house? As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Harbonah said, one of the chamberlains that was before the king, Look also at the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman has made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. And the king said, Hang him on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath was pacified.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
