Now what is your petition? And it will be granted you: or what is your request further? And it will be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said Esther, If it pleases the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king commanded it to be done so: and a decree was given out in Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Jews who were in Shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in Shushan; but on the spoil they didn't lay their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the other Jews who were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of those who hated them seventy and five thousand; but on the spoil they didn't lay their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[This was done] on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the Jews who were in Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth [day] of it, and on the fourteenth of it; and on the fifteenth [day] of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar [a day of] gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both near and far,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned to them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a good day; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai had written to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but when [the matter] came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return on his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore they called these days Purim, after the name of Pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the Jews appointed, and took on them, and on their seed, and on all such as joined themselves to them, so that it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to its writing, and according to its appointed time, every year;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the remembrance of them perish from their seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew, wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of Purim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he sent letters to all the Jews, to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, [with] words of peace and truth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>to confirm these days of Purim in their appointed times, according to as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them, and as they had appointed for themselves and for their seed, in the matter of the fasts and their cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the commandment of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and it was written in the book.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
