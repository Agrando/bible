that I may have something of which to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yes, and if I am offered on the sacrifice and ministry of your{+} faith, I joy, and rejoice with all of you{+}:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and in the same manner do you{+} also joy, and rejoice with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you{+}, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your{+} state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your{+} state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But you{+} know the proof of him, that, as a child [to] a father, he served as a slave with me in furtherance of the good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore I hope to send him forthwith, as soon as I will see how it will go with me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I counted it necessary to send to you{+} Epaphroditus, my brother and coworker and fellow-soldier, and your{+} messenger and minister to my need;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>since he longed after all of you{+}, and was very troubled, because you{+} had heard that he was sick:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you{+} see him again, you{+} may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because for the work of Christ he came near to death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your{+} ministry toward me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
