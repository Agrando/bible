Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and in this I rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I know that this will turn out to my salvation, through your{+} supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing will I be put to shame, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if to live in the flesh, --[if] this will bring fruit from my work, then what I will choose I don't know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I am in a strait between the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>yet to stay in the flesh is more needful for your{+} sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And having this confidence, I know that I will stay, yes, and stay with all of you{+}, for your{+} progress and joy in the faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that your{+} glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you{+} again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only let your{+} manner of life be worthy of the good news of Christ: that, whether I come and see you{+} or am absent, I may hear of your{+} state, that you{+} stand fast in one spirit, one soul, struggling for the faith of the good news;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and in nothing frightened by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your{+} salvation, and that from God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>because to you{+} it has been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same conflict which you{+} saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
