You{+} have laid up your{+} treasure in the last days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Look, the wages of the workers who mowed your{+} fields, which you{+} kept back by fraud, cries out: and the cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You{+} have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your{+} pleasure; you{+} have nourished your{+} hearts in a day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You{+} have condemned, you{+} have killed the righteous; he does not resist you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Look, the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receives the early and latter rain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be{+} also patient; establish your{+} hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Don't murmur, brothers, one against another, that you{+} are not judged: look, the judge stands before the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Take, brothers, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Look, we call them blessed that endured: you{+} have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord, how that the Lord is full of pity, and merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But above all things, my brothers, don't swear, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your{+} yes be yes, and your{+} no, no; that you{+} may not fall under judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is any among you{+} suffering? Let him pray. Is any cheerful? Let him sing praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is any among you{+} sick? Let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the prayer of faith will save him who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Confess therefore your{+} sins one to another, and pray one for another, that you{+} may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man avails much in its working.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Elijah was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he prayed again; and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My brothers, if any among you{+} errs from the truth, and one converts him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>let him know, that he who converts a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death, and will cover a multitude of sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
