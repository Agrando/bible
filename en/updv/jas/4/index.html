Don't [they come] from here, [even] of your{+} pleasures that war in your{+} members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You{+} lust and don't have; so you{+} kill. And you{+} covet and cannot obtain; so you{+} fight and war. You{+} don't have, because you{+} don't ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You{+} ask, and don't receive, because you{+} ask amiss, that you{+} may spend [it] in your{+} pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You{+} adulteresses, don't you{+} know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore would be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you{+} think that in vain the Scripture says, The spirit which he made to dwell in us longingly desires to [the point of] envy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives more grace. Therefore [the Scripture] says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Be subject therefore to God; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you{+}. Cleanse your{+} hands, you{+} sinners; and purify your{+} hearts, you{+} who lead a double life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your{+} laughter be turned to mourning, and your{+} joy to heaviness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he will exalt you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Don't speak one against another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother, or judges his brother, speaks against the law, and judges the law: but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law, but a judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is [only] one lawgiver and judge, the one who is able to save and to destroy: but who are you that judge your fellow man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, you{+} who say, Today or tomorrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and will gain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whereas you{+} don't know what will be on the next day. What is your{+} life? For you{+} are a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead you{+} ought to say, If the Lord wills, we will both live, and do this or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you{+} glory in your{+} vauntings: all such glorying is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>To him therefore that knows to do good, and doesn't do it, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
