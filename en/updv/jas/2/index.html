Don't the rich oppress you{+}, and themselves drag you{+} into court?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Don't they blaspheme the honorable name by which you{+} are called?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless if you{+} fulfill the royal law, according to the Scripture, You will love your fellow man as yourself, you{+} do well:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if you{+} have respect of persons, you{+} commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever will keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one [point], he has become guilty of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you do not commit adultery, but kill, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak{+}, and so do{+}, as men who are to be judged by a law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment [is] without mercy to him who has shown no mercy: mercy glories against judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What does it profit, my brothers, if a man says he has faith, but doesn't have works? Can that faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or sister is naked and in lack of daily food,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you{+} says to them, Go in peace, be{+} warmed and filled; and yet you{+} don't give them the things needful to the body; what does it profit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Even so faith, if it doesn't have works, is dead in itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes, a man will say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith apart from [your] works, and I by my works will show you [my] faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that there is [only] one God; you do well: the demons also believe, and shudder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But do you want to know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wasn't Abraham our father justified by works, in that he offered up Isaac his son on the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see that faith was working with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You{+} see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in like manner wasn't also Rahab the prostitute justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
