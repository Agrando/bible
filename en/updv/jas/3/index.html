If any doesn't stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now if we put the horses' bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Look, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, where the impulse of the helmsman wills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the tongue also is a little member, and boasts great things. Look, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the tongue no man can tame; [it is] a restless evil, [it is] full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless the Lord and Father; and with it we curse men, who are made after the likeness of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Does the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet [water] and bitter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt water yield sweet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you{+}? Let him show, by his good life, his works in meekness of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you{+} have bitter jealousy and faction in your{+} heart, don't glory and don't lie against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This wisdom is not [a wisdom] that comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile action.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
