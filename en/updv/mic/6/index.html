And in what have I wearied you? Testify against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of slaves; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [remember] from Shittim to Gilgal, that you{+} may know the righteous acts of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>How shall I come before Yahweh, and bow myself before the high God?
