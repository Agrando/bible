When the morning is light, they do it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a [noble] man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh: Look, I devise an evil against this family, from which you{+} will not remove your{+} necks, neither will you{+} walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In that day they will take up a parable against you{+}, and lament with a doleful lamentation, [and] say, We are completely ruined: he exchanges the portion of my people: how he removes [it] from me! In order to make restitution, he divides our fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore you will have none who will cast the line by lot in the assembly of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Do not prophesy{+}, [thus] they prophesy. They will not prophesy to these: reproaches will not depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will it be said, O house of Jacob, Is the Spirit of Yahweh straitened? Are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him who walks uprightly?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Even yesterday my people rose up as an enemy: in front of a cloak you{+} strip the glory from those who pass by securely, being averse to war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The women of my people you{+} cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children you{+} take away my glory forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Arise{+}, and depart; for this is not your{+} resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroys, even with a grievous destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If a man walking after the wind and producing lies, lies, [saying], I will prophesy to you of wine and of strong drink; he will even be the prophet of this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of you; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they will make great noise by reason of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The breaker has gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and have gone out of it; and their king has passed on before them, and Yahweh at the head of them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
