For I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desires the first-ripe fig.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The godly has perished from the earth, and the upright is not among man: all of them lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asks, and the judge [is ready] for a reward; and the great man, he utters the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The best of them is as a brier; the upright is [worse] than a thorn hedge: the day of your watchmen, even your visitation, has come; now will be their perplexity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Don't trust{+} in a companion; don't put{+} confidence in a best friend; keep the doors of your mouth from her who lies in your bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the son dishonors the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But as for me, I will look to Yahweh; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Don't rejoice against me, O my enemy: when I fall, I will arise; when I sit in darkness, Yahweh will be a light to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, because I have sinned against him, until he pleads my cause, and executes judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, [and] I will see his righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then my enemy will see it, and shame will cover her who said to me, Where is Yahweh your God? My eyes will see [my desire] on her; now she will be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A day for building your walls! In that day the decree will be far removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In that day they will come to you from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and [from] mountain to mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet the land will be desolate because of those who dwell in it, for the fruit of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Shepherd your people with your rod, the flock of your heritage, which stay solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them pasture in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As in the days of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt I will show him marvelous things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The nations will see and be ashamed of all their might; they will lay their hand on their mouth; their ears will be deaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They will lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they will come trembling out of their close places; they will come with fear to Yahweh our God, and will be afraid because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Who is a God like you, that pardons iniquity, and passes over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He does not retain his anger forever, because he delights in loving-kindness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will again have compassion on us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and you will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You will perform the truth to Jacob, [and] the loving-kindness to Abraham, which you have sworn to our fathers from the days of old.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
