For out of Zion will go forth the law, and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations far off: and they will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation will not lift up sword against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they will sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none will make them afraid: for the mouth of Yahweh of hosts has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his god; and we will walk in the name of Yahweh our God forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In that day, says Yahweh, I will assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and Yahweh will reign over them in mount Zion from now on even forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, to you it will come, yes, the former dominion will come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now why do you cry out aloud?
