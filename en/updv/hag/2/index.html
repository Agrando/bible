And how do you{+} see it now? Is it not in your{+} eyes as nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says Yahweh; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; and be strong, all you{+} people of the land, says Yahweh, and work: for I am with you{+}, says Yahweh of hosts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>[according to] the word that I covenanted with you{+} when you{+} came out of Egypt, and my Spirit remained among you{+}: don't be{+} afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this is what Yahweh of Hosts says: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I will shake all nations; and the precious things of all nations will come; and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former, says Yahweh of hosts; and in this place I will give peace, says Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the four and twentieth [day] of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If one bears holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touches bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, will it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Haggai said, If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touches any of these, will it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It will be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, says Yahweh; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And now, I pray you{+}, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of Yahweh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>how were you? When one came to a heap of twenty [measures], there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty vessels, there were but twenty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I struck you{+} with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your{+} hands; yet you{+} did not [turn] to me, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Consider, I pray you{+}, from this day and backward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth [month], since the day that the foundation of Yahweh's temple was laid, consider it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Is the seed yet in the barn? And even the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree have not brought forth; from this day I will bless [you{+}].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the four and twentieth [day] of the month, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms; and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them; and the horses and their riders will come down, every one by the sword of his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In that day, says Yahweh of hosts, I will take you, O Zerubbabel, my slave, the son of Shealtiel, says Yahweh, and will make you as a signet; for I have chosen you, says Yahweh of hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
