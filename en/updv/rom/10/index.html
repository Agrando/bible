(that is, to bring Christ down:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>or, Who will descend into the abyss? (That is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what does it say? The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that if you will confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and will believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For with the heart man believes to righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Scripture says, Whoever believes on him will not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same [Lord] is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for, Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how will they preach, except they be sent? According to as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they did not all listen to the good news. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So belief [comes] of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, Is it the case that they have not heard? On the contrary, Their sound went out into all the earth, And their words to the ends of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses says, I will provoke you{+} to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding I will anger you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaiah is very bold, and says, I was found by those who did not seek me; I became manifest to those who did not ask of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as to Israel he says, All the day long I spread out my hands to a disobedient and opposing people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
