And they who have not heard will understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you{+}:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come to you{+},</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whenever I go to Spain (for I hope to see you{+} in my journey, and to be brought on my way to there by you{+}, if first in some measure I will have been satisfied with your{+} company)--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but now, I [say], I go to Jerusalem, serving the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints who are at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yes, it has been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles shared in their spiritual things, they owe it [to them] also to minister to them in carnal things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you{+} to Spain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know that, when I come to you{+}, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I urge you{+}, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you{+} strive together with me in your{+} prayers to God for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from those who are disobedient in Judea, and [that] my service which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that I may come to you{+} in joy through the will of God, and together with you{+} find rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now the God of peace be with all of you{+}. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
