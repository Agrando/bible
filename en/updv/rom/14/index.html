To his own lord he stands or falls. Yes, he will be made to stand; for the Lord has power to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For one man esteems one day above another: another esteems every day [alike]. Let each be fully assured in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who regards the day, regards it to the Lord: and he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For whether we live, we live to the Lord; or whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For to this end Christ died and lived [again], that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you again, why do you set at nothing your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment-seat of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written, As I live, says the Lord, to me every knee will bow, And every tongue will confess to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then each of us will give account of himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us not therefore judge one another anymore: but judge{+} this rather, that no man put a stumbling block in his brother's way, or an occasion of falling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is common of itself: except that to him who accounts anything to be common, to him it is common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if because of meat your brother is grieved, you walk no longer in love. Don't destroy with your meat him for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Don't let then your{+} good be evil spoken of:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he who in this [way] is serving as a slave to Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things by which we may edify one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Don't overthrow the work of God for meat's sake. All things indeed are clean; nevertheless it is evil for that man who eats with offense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor [to do anything] by which your brother stumbles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The faith which you have, you have to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not judge himself in that which he approves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because [he eats] not of faith; and whatever is not of faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
