May God, who is over all, be blessed forever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But [it is] not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, who are of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>neither, because they are Abraham's seed, are they all children: but, In Isaac will your seed be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this is a word of promise, According to this season I will come, and Sarah will have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, [even] by our father Isaac--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for [the children] not being yet born, neither having participated in anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stay,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>not of works, but of him who calls, it was said to her, The elder will serve as a slave to the younger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>According to as it is written, Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he says to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, For this very purpose I raised you up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So then he has mercy on whom he wants, and he hardens whom he wants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You will say then to me, Why then does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On the contrary, O man, who are you that reply against God? Will the thing formed say to him who formed it, Why did you make me thus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or has not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel to honor, and another to shame?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared in advance to glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[even] us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As he says also in Hosea, I will call that my people, which was not my people; And her beloved, that was not beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it will be, [that] in the place where it was said to them, You{+} are not my people, There they will be called sons of the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaiah cries concerning Israel, If the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that will be saved:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for the Lord will execute [his] word on the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And, as Isaiah has said before, Except Yahweh of hosts had left us a seed, We had become as Sodom, and had been made like Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who did not follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at [that] law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why? Because [they sought it] not by faith, but as it were by works. They stumbled at the stone of stumbling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>even as it is written, Look, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense: And he who believes on him will not be put to shame.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
