And do you want to not fear the power? Do that which is good, and you will have praise from the same:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for he is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword for nothing: for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who participates in evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore [you{+}] must surely be in subjection, not only because of wrath, but also because of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For this cause you{+} pay taxes also; for they are ministers of God's service, attending continually on this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render to all their dues: tax to whom tax [is due]; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe no man anything, except to love one another: for he who loves another has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this, You will not commit adultery, You will not kill, You will not steal, You will not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, You will love your fellow man as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love works no ill to his fellow man: love therefore is the fulfillment of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this, knowing the season, that already it is time for you{+} to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in reveling and drunkenness, not in promiscuity and sexual immorality, not in strife and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put{+} on the Lord Jesus Christ, and don't make provision for the flesh, to [fulfill] the desires [of it].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
