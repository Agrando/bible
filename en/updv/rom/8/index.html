But if any man does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if Christ is in you{+}, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you{+}, he who raised up Christ from the dead will give life also to your{+} mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwells in you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for if you{+} live after the flesh, you{+} must die; but if by the Spirit you{+} put to death the activities of the body, you{+} will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you{+} didn't receive the spirit of slavery again to fear; but you{+} received the spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, Abba, Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with [him], that we may be also glorified with [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the earnest expectation of the creation waits for the revealing of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that the creation itself also will be delivered from the slavery of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan inside ourselves, waiting for [our] adoption, [to wit], the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopes for that which he sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for that which we don't see, [then] we wait for it with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And in like manner the Spirit also helps our infirmity: for we don't know how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself makes intercession for [us] with groanings which can't be uttered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to [the will of] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that to those who love God all things work together for good, to those who are called according to [his] purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whom he foreknew, he also preappointed [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and whom he preappointed, those he also called: and whom he called, those he also justified: and whom he justified, those he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What then shall we say to these things? If God [is] for us, who [is] against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who didn't spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not also with him freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who will lay anything to the charge of God's elect? It is God who justifies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>who is he that condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died, and what's more, who was raised, who also is at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Even as it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
