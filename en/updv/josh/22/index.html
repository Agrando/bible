And it will be, seeing you{+} rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless, if the land of your{+} possession is unclean, then you{+} pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh, in which Yahweh's tabernacle stays, and take possession among us: but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us, in building yourselves an altar besides the altar of Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? And that man didn't perish alone in his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads of the thousands of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows; and Israel he will know: if it is in rebellion, or if in trespass against Yahweh, don't you save us this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If we have built ourselves an altar to turn away from following Yahweh; or if to offer on it burnt-offering or meal-offering, or if to offer sacrifices of peace-offerings on it, let Yahweh himself require it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this, [and] of purpose, saying, In time to come your{+} sons might speak to our sons, saying, What do you{+} have to do with Yahweh, the God of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you{+}, you{+} sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you{+} have no portion in Yahweh: so might your{+} sons make our sons cease from fearing Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build ourselves an altar, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but it will be a witness between us and you{+}, and between our generations after us, that we may do the service of Yahweh before him with our burnt-offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace-offerings; that your{+} sons may not say to our sons in time to come, You{+} have no portion in Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore we said, It will be, when they so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we will say, Look at the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, nor for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh, and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar for burnt-offering, for meal-offering, or for sacrifice, besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation, even the heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Manasseh, This day we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us, because you{+} haven't committed this trespass against Yahweh: now you{+} have delivered the sons of Israel out of the hand of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the sons of Reuben, and from the sons of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought word back to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the thing pleased the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them to war, to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad dwelt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad gave the altar a name: It is a witness between us that Yahweh is God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
