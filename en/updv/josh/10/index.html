Isn't this written in the Book of Jashar? And the sun stopped in the midst of heaven, and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh listened to the voice of a man: for Yahweh fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And these five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makkedah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to keep them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but don't you{+} stop; pursue after your{+} enemies, and strike the hindmost of them; don't allow them to enter into their cities: for Yahweh your{+} God has delivered them into your{+} hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass, when Joshua and the sons of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained of them had entered into the fortified cities,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth those five kings to me out of the cave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war that went with him, Come near, put your{+} feet on the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet on the necks of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua said to them, Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage: for thus will Yahweh do to all your{+} enemies against whom you{+} fight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And afterward Joshua struck them, and put them to death, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging on the trees until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves, and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, to this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king: he completely destroyed them and all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and Yahweh delivered it also, and its king, into the hand of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining in it; and he did to its king as he had done to the king of Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel; and he took it on the second day, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were in it, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon; and they encamped against it, and fought against it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge of the sword; and all the souls who were in it he completely destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron; and they fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword, and its king, and all its cities, and all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but he completely destroyed it, and all the souls who were in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir, and fought against it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and he took it, and its king, and all its cities; and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and completely destroyed all the souls who were in it; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to its king; as he had done also to Libnah, and to its king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Joshua struck all the land, the hill-country, and the South, and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but he completely destroyed all that breathed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even to Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And all these kings and their land Joshua took at one time, because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
