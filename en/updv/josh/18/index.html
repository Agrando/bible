and they will come to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they will divide it into seven portions: Judah will remain in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph will remain in their border on the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you{+} will describe the land into seven portions, and bring [the description] here to me; and I will cast lots for you{+} here before Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the Levites have no portion among you{+}; for the priesthood of Yahweh is their inheritance: and Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the slave of Yahweh gave them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the men arose, and went: and Joshua charged those who went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots for you{+} here before Yahweh in Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the men went and passed through the land, and described it by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh: and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families: and the border of their lot went out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan; and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north, and went up through the hill-country westward; and the goings out of it were at the wilderness of Beth-aven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz (the same is Beth-el), southward; and the border went down to Ataroth-orech, by the mountain that lies on the south of Beth-horon the nether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the border extended [from there], and turned about on the west quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out of it were at Kiriath-baal (the same is Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah: this was the west quarter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath-jearim; and the border went out toward Iyyim, and went out to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward, and went down to En-rogel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and it extended northward, and went out at En-shemesh, and went out to Geliloth, which is across from the ascent of Adummim; and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and it passed along to the side across from the Arabah northward, and went down to the Arabah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the border passed along to the side of Beth-hoglah northward; and the goings out of the border were at the north bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan: this was the south border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, by its borders round about, according to their families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, and Beth-hoglah, and Emek-keziz,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and Beth-arabah, and Zemaraim, and Beth-el,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and Chephar-ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities with their villages:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, that is Jerusalem, Gibeath, [and] Kiriath-jearim; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin according to their families.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
