And they went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name was Rahab, and lay there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Look, there came men in here tonight of the sons of Israel to search out the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men who came to you, that entered into your house; for they came to search out all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the woman took the two men. And she hid it, and she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I didn't know from where they were:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out; where the men went I don't know: pursue after them quickly; for you{+} will overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan to the fords: and as soon as those who pursued after them had gone out, they shut the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And before they were laid down, she came up to them on the roof;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and she said to the men, I know that Yahweh has given you{+} the land, and that the fear of you{+} is fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the Red Sea before you{+}, when you{+} came out of Egypt; and what you{+} did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you{+} completely destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain anymore spirit in any man, because of you{+}: for Yahweh your{+} God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore, I pray you{+}, swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt kindly with you{+}, that you{+} also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a true token;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and that you{+} will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all who they have, and will deliver our lives from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the men said to her, Our life for yours{+}, if you{+} do not utter this business of ours; then it will be, when Yahweh gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the side of the wall, and she dwelt on the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she said to them, Go{+} to the mountain, or else the pursuers will fall on you{+}; then hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers return: and afterward may you{+} go your{+} way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men said to her, We will be innocent of this oath of yours which you have made us to swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look, when we come into the land, you will bind this line of scarlet thread in the window by which you have let us down: and you will gather to yourself into the house your father, and your mother, and your brothers, and all your father's household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it will be, that whoever will go out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be innocent: and whoever will be with you in the house, his blood will be on our head, if any hand is on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if you utter this business of ours, then we will be innocent of your oath which you have made us to swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she said, According to your{+} words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And then they went, and came to the mountain, and remained there three days, until the pursuers had returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but didn't find them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they said to Joshua, Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands all the land; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
