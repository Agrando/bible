And Joshua said to them, Who are you{+}? And from where do you{+} come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to him, From a very far country your slaves have come because of the name of Yahweh your God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provision in your{+} hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, We are your{+} slaves: and now make{+} a covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This bread of ours we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go to you{+}; but now, look, it is dry, and has become mouldy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and, look, they are rent: and these garments of ours and our sandals have become old by reason of the very long journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the men took of their provision, and didn't ask counsel at the mouth of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they lived nearby, and that they dwelt among them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for the sons of Israel journeyed, and came to their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the princes of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But all the princes said to all the congregation, We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us, because of the oath which we swore to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the princes said to them, Let them live and become cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation. So they became cutters of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the princes had spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying, Why have you{+} beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you{+}; when you{+} dwell among us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore you{+} are cursed, and there will never fail to be of you{+} slaves, both cutters of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told your slaves, how that Yahweh your God commanded his slave Moses to give you{+} all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you{+}; therefore we were very afraid for our lives because of you{+}, and have done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, look, we are in your hand: as it seems good and right to you to do to us, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, that they did not slay them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joshua made them that day cutters of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place which he should choose.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
