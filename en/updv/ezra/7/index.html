and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of Yahweh his God on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there went up some of the sons of Israel, and of the priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and those given [to temple service], to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For on the first [day] of the first month he began to go up from Babylon; and on the first [day] of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Yahweh, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, even the scribe of the words of the commandments of Yahweh, and of his statutes to Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect and so forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I make a decree, that all those of the people of Israel, and their priests and the Levites, in my realm, who are minded of their own free will to go to Jerusalem, go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Since you are sent of the king and his seven counselors, to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of your God which is in your hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and all the silver and gold that you will find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill-offering of the people, and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>therefore you will with all diligence buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their meal-offerings and their drink-offerings, and will offer them on the altar of the house of your{+} God which is in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And whatever will seem good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, do{+} that after the will of your{+} God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And whatever more will be needful for the house of your God, which you will have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the king's treasure-house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers who are beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, will require of you{+}, it is to be done with all diligence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>to a hundred talents of silver, and to a hundred cors of wheat, and to a hundred baths of wine, and to a hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Also we inform you{+}, that concerning any of the priests and Levites, the singers, porters, Nethinim, or servants of this house of God, it will not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll, on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you, Ezra, after the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people who are beyond the River, all such as know the laws of your God; and teach{+} him who doesn't know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whoever will not do the law of your God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed on him with all diligence, whether it is to death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Blessed be Yahweh, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and has extended loving-kindness to me before the king, and his counselors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I was strengthened according to the hand of Yahweh my God on me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
