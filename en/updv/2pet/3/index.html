For, from the day that the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this they willfully forget, that there were heavens from of old, and an earth compacted out of water and amid water, by the word of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>by which means the world that then was, being overflowed in water, perished:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but the heavens that now are, and the earth, by the same word have been stored up for fire, being reserved against the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But do not forget this one thing, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some count slackness; but is long-suffering toward you{+}, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fervent heat, and the earth and the works that are in it will be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Seeing that these things are thus all to be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you{+} to be in [all] holy living and godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>looking for and earnestly desiring the coming of the day of God, by reason of which the heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But, according to his promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, beloved, seeing that you{+} look for these things, be diligent that you{+} may be found in peace, without spot and blameless in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you{+};</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>as also in all [his] letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which the ignorant and unstedfast wrest, as [they do] also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You{+} therefore, beloved, knowing [these things] beforehand, beware lest, being carried away with the error of the wicked, you{+} fall from your{+} own steadfastness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. To him [be] the glory both now and forever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
