And these things I didn't say to you{+} from the beginning, because I was with you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I go to him who sent me; and none of you{+} asks me, Where do you go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But because I have spoken these things to you{+}, sorrow has filled your{+} heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Nevertheless I tell you{+} the truth: It is expedient for you{+} that I go away; for if I don't go away, the Comforter will not come to you{+}; but if I go, I will send him to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he, when he has come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>of sin, because they do not believe on me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you{+} see me no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>of judgment, because the prince of this world has been judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet many things to say to you{+}, but you{+} can't bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you{+} into all the truth: for he will not speak from himself; but whatever he will hear, he will speak: and he will declare to you{+} the things that are to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me: for he will take of mine, and will declare [it] to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All things that the Father has are mine: therefore I said, that he takes of mine, and will declare [it] to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A little while, and you{+} see me no more; and again a little while, and you{+} will see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[Some] of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he says to us, A little while, and you{+} don't see me; and again a little while, and you{+} will see me: and, Because I go to the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They said therefore, What is this that he says, A little while? We don't know what he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said to them, Do you{+} inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and you{+} don't see me, and again a little while, and you{+} will see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, that you{+} will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice: you{+} will be sorrowful, but your{+} sorrow will be turned into joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour has come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you{+} therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you{+} again, and your{+} heart will rejoice, and your{+} joy no one takes away from you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day you{+} will ask me no question. Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, if you{+} will ask anything of the Father in my name, he will give it you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Until now have you{+} asked nothing in my name: ask, and you{+} will receive, that your{+} joy may be made full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These things I have spoken to you{+} in dark sayings: the hour comes, when I will no more speak to you{+} in dark sayings, but will tell you{+} plainly of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day you{+} will ask in my name: and I don't say to you{+}, that I will pray the Father for you{+};</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loves you{+}, because you{+} have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came out from the Father, and have come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples say, Look, now you speak plainly, and speak no dark saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that you know all things, and don't need that any man should ask you: by this we believe that you came forth from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus answered them, Do you{+} now believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Look, the hour comes, yes, has come, that you{+} will be scattered, every man to his own, and will leave me alone: and [yet] I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These things I have spoken to you{+}, that in me you{+} may have peace. In the world you{+} have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
