Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus says to her, Give me a drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask me for a drink, being a Samaritan woman? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me a drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman says to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then do you have that living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never thirst; but the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, neither come all the way here to draw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He says to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered and said to him, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, You said well, I have no husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: this you have said truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman says to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and you{+} say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, will you{+} worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You{+} worship that which you{+} don't know: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such does the Father seek to be his worshipers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is spirit: and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman says to him, I know that Messiah comes (he who is called Christ): when he has come, he will declare to us all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus says to her, I am he who speaks to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And on this his disciples came; and they marveled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What do you seek? Or, Why do you speak with her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and says to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Come, see a man, who told me all things that I ever did: can this be the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the meanwhile the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you{+} do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples therefore said one to another, Has any man brought him [anything] to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus says to them, My meat is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Don't you{+} say, There are yet four months, and [then] comes the harvest? Look, I say to you{+}, Lift up your{+} eyes, and look at the fields, that they are white to harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Already he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life; that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For in this is the saying true, One sows, and another reaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you{+} to reap that for which you{+} have not labored: others have labored, and you{+} have entered into their labor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that [ever] I did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when the Samaritans came to him, they implored him to stay with them: and he stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed because of his word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And after the two days he went forth from there into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When he heard that Jesus came out of Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and implored [him] that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jesus therefore said to him, Except you{+} see signs and wonders, you{+} will in no way believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The nobleman says to him, Sir, come down before my child dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus says to him, Go your way; your son lives. The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And as he was now going down, his slaves met him, saying, that his boy lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So the father knew that [it was] at that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now this is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
