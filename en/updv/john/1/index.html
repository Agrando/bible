That which has come to exist</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>in him was life; and the life was the light of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the light shines in the darkness; and the darkness did not apprehend it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He was not the light, but [came] that he might bear witness of the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There was the true light, which lights every man, coming into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He was in the world, and the world came into existence through him, and the world did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He came to his own, and those who were his own did not receive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe on his name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw his glory, glory as an only begotten from a father, full of grace and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>John bears witness of him, and cries out, saying, This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me has become ahead of me: for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For of his fullness we all received, and grace for grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the witness of John, when the Jews from Jerusalem sent to him priests and Levites to ask him, Who are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he confessed, and did not deny; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, What then? Are you Elijah? And he says, I am not. Are you the prophet? And he answered, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They said therefore to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say of yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of Yahweh, as Isaiah the prophet said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they had been sent from the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him, and said to him, Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, I baptize in water. Among you{+} stands one whom you{+} don't know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>[even] he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>On the next day he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who has become ahead of me: for he was before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I didn't know him; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause I came baptizing in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John bore witness, saying, I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it stayed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I didn't know him: but he who sent me to baptize in water, he said to me, On whomever you will see the Spirit descending, and staying on him, the same is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Again on the next day John was standing, and two of his disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he looked on Jesus as he walked, and says, Look, the Lamb of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jesus turned, and looked at them following, and says to them, What do you{+} seek? And they said to him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where do you stay?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He says to them, Come, and you{+} will see. They came therefore and saw where he stayed; and they stayed with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>One of the two that heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>He finds first his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked on him, and said, You are Simon the son of John: you will be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>On the next day he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he finds Philip: and Jesus says to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip finds Nathaniel, and says to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathaniel said to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him, and says of him, Look, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathaniel says to him, From where do you know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathaniel answered him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you underneath the fig tree, you believe? You will see greater things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he says to him, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, You{+} will see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
