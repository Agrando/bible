He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The neighbors therefore, and those who saw him previously, that he was a beggar, said, Isn't this he who sat and begged?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am [he].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They said therefore to him, How then were your eyes opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered, The man who is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said to him, Where is he? He says, I don't know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They bring to the Pharisees him who previously was blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was the Sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man who is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say therefore to the blind man again, What do you say of him, in that he opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and asked them, saying, Is this your{+} son, who you{+} say was born blind? How then does he now see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents therefore answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but how he now sees, we don't know; or who opened his eyes, we don't know: ask him; he is of age; he will speak for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him [to be] Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore his parents said, He is of age; ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they called a second time the man who was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I don't know: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They said therefore to him, What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered them, I told you{+} even now, and you{+} did not hear; why do you{+} want to hear it again? Do you{+} also want to become his disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they reviled him, and said, You are his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God has spoken to Moses: but as for this man, we don't know where he is from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered and said to them, Therefore, in this is the marvel, that you{+} don't know where he is from, and [yet] he opened my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God does not hear sinners: but if any man is a worshiper of God, and does his will, him he hears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Never was it heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Do you believe in the Son of Man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said, For judgment I came into this world, that those who don't see may see; and that those who see may become blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said to him, Are we also blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, If you{+} were blind, you{+} would have no sin: but now you{+} say, We see: your{+} sin stays.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
