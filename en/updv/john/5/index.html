Now it was the Sabbath on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the Jews said to him who was cured, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he answered them, He who made me whole, the same said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up [your bed], and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he who was healed did not know who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Look, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus answered them, My Father works even until now, and I work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father doing: for whatever things he does, these the Son also does in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and greater works than these he will show him, that you{+} may marvel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son also gives life to whom he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For neither does the Father judge any man, but he has given all judgment to the Son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, He who hears my word, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, The hour comes, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Don't marvel at this: for the hour comes, in which all who are in the tombs will hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and will come forth; those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have participated in evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I don't seek my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You{+} have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the witness which I receive is not from man: nevertheless I say these things, that you{+} may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was the lamp that burns and shines; and you{+} were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But the witness which I have is greater than [that of] John; for the works which the Father has given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father who sent me, he has borne witness of me. You{+} have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you{+} do not have his word staying in you{+}: for whom he sent, him you{+} do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>You{+} search the Scriptures, because you{+} think that in them you{+} have eternal life; and those are the ones which bear witness of me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and you{+} will not come to me, that you{+} may have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I do not receive glory from men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you{+}, that you{+} do not have the love of God in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in my Father's name, and you{+} do not receive me: if another will come in his own name, him you{+} will receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>How can you{+} believe, who receive glory one of another, and the glory that [comes] from the only God, you{+} do not seek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do not think that I will accuse you{+} to the Father: there is one who accuses you{+}, [even] Moses, on whom you{+} have set your{+} hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you{+} believed Moses, you{+} would believe me; for he wrote of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if you{+} do not believe his writings, how will you{+} believe my words?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
