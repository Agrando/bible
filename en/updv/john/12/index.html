Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause I came to this hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify your name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, [saying], I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel has spoken to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, This voice has not come for my sake, but for your{+} sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world: now will the prince of this world be cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ stays forever: and how do you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light among you{+}. Walk while you{+} have the light, that darkness does not overtake you{+}: and he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you{+} have the light, believe on the light, that you{+} may become sons of light. These things Jesus spoke, and he departed and hid himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they didn't believe on him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For this cause they could not believe, for Isaiah said again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He has blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah said these things, because he saw his glory; and he spoke of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [it], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jesus cried and said, He who believes on me, does not believe on me, but on him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he who looks at me looks at him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come a light into the world, that whoever believes on me may not stay in the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if any man hears my sayings, and does not keep them, I do not judge him: for I didn't come to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who rejects me, and does not receive my sayings, has one who judges him: the word that I spoke, the same will judge him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I did not speak from myself; but the Father who sent me, he has given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is eternal life: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me, so I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
