I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I received from my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of them said, He has a demon, and is insane; why do you{+} hear him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then came the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Jews therefore came around him, and said to him, How long do you hold us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, I told you{+}, and you{+} do not believe: the works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you{+} do not believe, because you{+} are not of my sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I give to them eternal life; and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>What my Father has given to me is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch out of the Father's hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and the Father are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews took up stones again to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, Many good works I have shown you{+} from the Father; for which of those works do you{+} stone me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, For a good work we don't stone you, but for blasphemy; and because you, being a man, make yourself God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your{+} law, I said, you{+} are gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture can't be broken),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you{+} say of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You blaspheme; because I said, I am [the] Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I don't do the works of my Father, don't believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I do them, though you{+} don't believe me, believe the works: that you{+} may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore they sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatever John spoke of this man were true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed on him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
