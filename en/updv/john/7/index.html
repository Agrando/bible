If you do these things, manifest yourself to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For even his brothers did not believe on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet come; but your{+} time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world can't hate you{+}; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You{+} go up to the feast: I do not go up to this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And having said these things, he stayed in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when his brothers went up to the feast, then he went up also, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; but others said, Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the feast was already halfway through, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Jews therefore marveled, saying, How does this man know letters, having never learned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If any man wills to do his will, he will know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or [whether] I speak from myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory: but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Has not Moses given you{+} the law? And [yet] none of you{+} does the law. Why do you{+} seek to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The multitude answered, You have a demon: who seeks to kill you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, I did one work, and all of you{+} marvel because of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses has given you{+} circumcision--not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers--and on the Sabbath you{+} circumcise a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you{+} angry with me, because I made a man every bit whole on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Isn't this he whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And look, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Nevertheless we know this man from where he is: but when the Christ comes, no one knows from where he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, You{+} both know me, and know from where I am; and I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you{+} don't know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ will come, will he do more signs than those which this man has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you{+}, and I go to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You{+} will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, you{+} cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jews therefore said among themselves, Where will this man go that we will not find him? will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What is this word that he said, You{+} will seek me, and will not find me; and where I am, you{+} cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now on the last day, the great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He who believes on me, as the Scripture has said, from inside him will flow rivers of living water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But this he spoke of the Spirit, which those who believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet [given]; because Jesus was not yet glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>[Some] of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why didn't you{+} bring him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The attendants answered, Never did man so speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are you{+} also led astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Has any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this multitude that doesn't know the law are accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus, he who came to him before, being one of them, says to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Does our law judge a man, except it first hear from him and know what he does?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee rises no prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
