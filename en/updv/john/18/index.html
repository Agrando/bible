He says to them, I am [he]. And Judas also, who delivered him up, was standing with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When therefore he said to them, I am [he], they went backward, and fell to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Again therefore he asked them, Whom do you{+} seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus answered, I told you{+} that I am [he]; if therefore you{+} seek me, let these go their way:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, Of those whom you have given me I lost not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Simon Peter therefore having a sword drew it, and struck the high priest's slave, and cut off his right ear. Now the slave's name was Malchus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put up the sword into the sheath: the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the battalion and the colonel, and the attendants of the Jews, seized Jesus and bound him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and led him to Annas first; for he was father in law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and [so did] another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and entered in with Jesus into the court of the high priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the other disciple, known to the high priest, went out and spoke to her who kept the door, and brought in Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The female slave therefore that kept the door says to Peter, Are you also [one] of this man's disciples? He says, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the slaves and the attendants were standing [there], having made a fire of coals; for it was cold; and they were warming themselves: and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The high priest therefore asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered him, I have spoken openly to the world; I ever taught in synagogues, and in the temple, where all the Jews come together; and in secret I spoke nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard [me], what I spoke to them: look, these know the things which I said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said this, one of the attendants standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, Do you answer the high priest so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why do you strike me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Annas therefore sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, Are you also [one] of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the slaves of the high priest, being a kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Didn't I see you in the garden with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Peter therefore denied again: and right away the rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They lead Jesus therefore from Caiaphas into the Praetorium: and it was early; and they themselves didn't enter into the Praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Pilate therefore went out to them, and says, What accusation do you{+} bring against this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered and said to him, If this man were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pilate therefore said to them, Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your{+} law. The Jews said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, and called Jesus, and said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered, Do you say this of yourself, or did others tell it to you concerning me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests delivered you to me: what have you done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then my attendants would fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now my kingdom is not from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilate therefore said to him, Are you a king then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a king. To this end I have been born, and to this end I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilate says to him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no crime in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But you{+} have a custom, that I should release to you{+} one at the Passover: do you{+} want therefore that I release to you{+} the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
