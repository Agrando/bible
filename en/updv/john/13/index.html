He says to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you don't know now; but you will understand hereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter says to him, You will never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I don't wash you, you have no part with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus says to him, He who is bathed doesn't need to wash except for the feet, but is clean every bit: and you{+} are clean, but not all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knew him who should deliver him up; therefore he said, You{+} are not all clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So when he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and sat down again, he said to them, Do you{+} know what I have done to you{+}?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You{+} call me, The Teacher, and, The Lord: and you{+} say well; for so I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your{+} feet, you{+} also ought to wash one another's feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you{+} an example, that you{+} also should do as I have done to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, a slave is not greater than his lord; neither one who is sent greater than he who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you{+} know these things, blessed are you{+} if you{+} do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I don't speak of all of you{+}: I know whom I have chosen: but that the Scripture may be fulfilled: He who eats my bread lifted up his heel against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From now on I tell you{+} before it comes to pass, that, when it has come to pass, you{+} may believe that I am [he].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, he who receives whomever I send receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in the spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, that one of you{+} will deliver me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>There was at the table reclining in Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Simon Peter therefore beckons to him, to ask who it might be that he is talking about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore leaning back, as he was, on Jesus' breast, says to him, Lord, who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus answers, It is he, for whom I will dip the sop, and give it him. So when he had dipped the sop, he takes and gives it to Judas, [the son] of Simon Iscariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the sop, then Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore says to him, What you do, do quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus said to him, Buy what things we have need of for the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He then having received the sop went out right away: and it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When therefore he had gone out, Jesus says, Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and right away he will glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Little children, yet a little while I am with you{+}. You{+} will seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you{+} can't come; so now I say to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment I give to you{+}, that you{+} love one another; even as I have loved you{+}, that you{+} also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this will all men know that you{+} are my disciples, if you{+} have love one to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter says to him, Lord, where do you go? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can't follow now; but you will follow afterward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter says to him, Lord, why can't I follow you even now? I will lay down my life for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus answers, Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, The rooster will not crow, until you have denied me thrice.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
