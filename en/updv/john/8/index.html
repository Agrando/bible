Jesus answered, You{+} know neither me, nor my Father: if you{+} knew me, you{+} would know my Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said therefore again to them, I go away, and you{+} will seek me, and will die in your{+} sin: where I go, you{+} can't come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I go, you{+} can't come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, You{+} are from beneath; I am from above: you{+} are of this world; I am not of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I said therefore to you{+}, that you{+} will die in your{+} sins: for except you{+} believe that I am [he], you{+} will die in your{+} sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They said therefore to him, Who are you? Jesus said to them, Even that which I have also spoken to you{+} from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you{+}: nevertheless he who sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these I speak to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They didn't perceive that he spoke to them of the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jesus therefore said to them, When you{+} have lifted up the Son of Man, then you{+} will know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone; for I always do the things that are pleasing to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As he spoke these things, many believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If you{+} stay in my word, [then] you{+} are truly my disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and you{+} will know the truth, and the truth will make you{+} free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They answered to him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never yet served as any man's slaves: how do you say, You{+} will be made free?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, Everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the slave doesn't stay in the house forever: the son stays forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If therefore the Son will make you{+} free, you{+} will be free indeed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that you{+} are Abraham's seed: yet you{+} seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak the things which I have seen from the Father. And you{+} therefore, [should] do the things which you{+} heard from the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said to him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus says to them, If you{+} were Abraham's children, you{+} would be doing the works of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now you{+} seek to kill me, a man who has told you{+} the truth, which I heard from God: Abraham did not do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You{+} do the works of your{+} father. Therefore they said to him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, If God were your{+} Father, you{+} would love me: for I came forth and have come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Why don't you{+} understand my speech? [Even] because you{+} can't hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You{+} are of the father the devil, and the desires of your{+} father it is your{+} will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and did not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But because I say the truth, you{+} don't believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Which of you{+} convicts me of sin? If I say truth, why don't you{+} believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>He who is of God hears the words of God: for this cause you{+} do not hear [them], because you{+} are not of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Jews answered and said to him, Do we not say well that you are a Samaritan, and have a demon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you{+} dishonor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I don't seek my own glory: there is one who seeks and judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, If a man keeps my word, he will never see death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Therefore the Jews said to him, Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keeps my word, he will never taste of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died: whom do you make yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me; of whom you{+} say, He is our God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and you{+} have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I don't know him, I will be like you{+}, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Your{+} father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>The Jews therefore said to him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you{+}, Before Abraham was born, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
