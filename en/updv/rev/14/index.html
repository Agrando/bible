These [are] those who follow the Lamb wherever he may go. These were purchased from among men, [to be] the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good news to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he says with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment has come: and worship him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead, or on his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed undiluted in the cup of his anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is the patience of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard the voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on: yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I looked, and saw a white cloud; and on the cloud [I saw] one sitting like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him who sat on the cloud, Send forth your sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he who sat on the cloud cast his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the wine press of the great wrath of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the wine press was trodden outside the city, and there came out blood from the wine press, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as 184 miles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
