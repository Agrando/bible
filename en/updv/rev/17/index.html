And when I saw her, I wondered with a great wonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the angel said to me, Why did you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up out of the abyss, and goes into perdition. And those who dwell on the earth will wonder, [they] whose name has not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the beast, how that he was, and is not, and will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits: and they are seven kings;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>the five have fallen, the one is, the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must stay a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth, and is of the seven; and he goes into perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet; but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings; and they who are with him are called and chosen and faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he says to me, The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate the prostitute, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her completely with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God put in their hearts to do his mind, and to come to one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God should be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
