For in one hour is your judgment come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no man buys their merchandise anymore;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet; and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and of bronze, and iron, and marble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cinnamon, and spice, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and cattle, and sheep; and [merchandise] of horses and chariots and slaves--even souls of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the fruits which your soul desired are gone from you, and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and they will find them no more at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, will stand far off for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, Woe, woe, the great city, she who was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone and pearl!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For in an hour such great wealth is made desolate. And every shipmaster, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far off,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and cried out as they looked on the smoke of her burning, saying, What [city] is like the great city?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they cast dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her costliness! For in one hour is she made desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, you heaven, and you{+} saints, and you{+} apostles, and you{+} prophets; for God has judged your{+} judgment on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a strong angel took up a stone as it were a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with a mighty fall will Babylon, the great city, be cast down, and will be found no more at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the voice of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you; and no craftsman, of whatever craft, will be found anymore at all in you; and the voice of a mill will be heard no more at all in you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you: for your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your witchcraft were all the nations deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
