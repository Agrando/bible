And her smoke goes up forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the four and twenty elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Give praise to our God, all you{+} his slaves, and you{+} who fear him, the small and the great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah: for Yahweh our God, the Almighty, has begun to reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give the glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was given to her that she should array herself in fine linen, bright [and] pure: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he says to me, Write, Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb.
