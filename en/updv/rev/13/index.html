And who is able to war with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and there was given to him authority to continue forty and two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he opened his mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, [even] those who dwell in the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all who dwell on the earth will worship him, [everyone] whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the Book of Life of the Lamb that has been slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If any man has an ear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If any man [is] for captivity, into captivity he goes: if any man [is] to be killed with the sword, with the sword he will be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight. And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death-stroke was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he does great signs, that he should even make fire to come down out of heaven on the earth in the sight of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by reason of the signs which it was given him to do in the sight of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who has the stroke of the sword and lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it was given to him to give spirit to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as should not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the slaves, that there be given them a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and that no man should be able to buy or to sell, except he who has the mark, [even] the name of the beast or the number of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him count the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty-six.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
