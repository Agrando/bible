Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I marvel that you{+} are so quickly removing from him who called you{+} in the grace of Christ to different good news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>which is not other [good news], only there are some that trouble you{+}, and would pervert the good news of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you{+} good news other than that which we preached to you{+}, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we have said before, so I say now again, if any man preaches to you{+} good news other than that which you{+} received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still pleasing men, I should not be a slave of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I make known to you{+}, brothers, as concerning the good news which was preached by me, that it is not after man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but [it came to me] through revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you{+} have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and I advanced in the Jews' religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, [even] from my mother's womb, and called me through his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach [the good news of] him among the Gentiles; right away I did not confer with flesh and blood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I saw none of the other apostles, except James the Lord's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now concerning the things which I write to you{+}, look, before God, I don't lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I was still unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but they only heard it said, He who once persecuted us now preaches [the good news of] the faith of which he once made havoc;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they glorified God in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
