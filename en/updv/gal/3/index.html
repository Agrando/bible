Did you{+} receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Are you{+} so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you{+} now perfected in the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Did you{+} suffer so many things for nothing? If it is indeed for nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He therefore that supplies to you{+} the Spirit, and works miracles among you{+}, [does he do it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Know therefore that those who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the good news beforehand to Abraham, [saying,] In you will all the nations be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So then those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all things that are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous will live by faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the law is not of faith; but, He who does them will live in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that on the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Brothers, I speak after the manner of men: Though it is but a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void, or adds thereto.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to your seed, which is Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, does not disannul, so as to make the promise of no effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God has granted it to Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the seed should come to whom the promise has been made; [and it was] directed through angels by the hand of a mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one; but God is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could bring life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the Scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up to the faith which should afterward be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So that the law has become our tutor [to bring us] to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you{+} are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For as many of you{+} as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither slave nor free, there can be no male and female; for you{+} are all one in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you{+} are Christ's, then are you{+} Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
