God forbid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and it is no longer I who live, but Christ living in me: and that [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, [the faith] which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered himself up for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
