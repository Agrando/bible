You{+} did me no wrong:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but you{+} know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the good news to you{+} the first time:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and that which was a trial to you{+} in my flesh you{+} did not despise, nor reject; but you{+} received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where then is that blessedness of yours? For I bear you{+} witness, that, if possible, you{+} would have plucked out your{+} eyes and given them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then have I become your{+} enemy, by telling you{+} the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They zealously seek you{+} in no good way; no, they desire to shut you{+} out, that you{+} may seek them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you{+}--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but I could wish to be present with you{+} now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you{+} who desire to be under the law, don't you{+} hear the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman, and one by the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nevertheless the [son] by the slave woman is born after the flesh; but the [son] by the free woman [is born] through promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Which things contain an allegory: for these [women] are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children to slavery, which is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answers to the Jerusalem that now is: for she works as a slave along with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Rejoice, you barren that do not bear; Break forth and cry, you who do not travail: For more are the children of the desolate than of her who has the husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now you{+}, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But as then he who was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, so also it is now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Nevertheless what does the Scripture say? Cast out the slave woman and her son: for the son of the slave woman will not inherit with the son of the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, brothers, we are not children of a slave woman, but of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
