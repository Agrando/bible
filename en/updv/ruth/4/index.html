Turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit{+} down here. And they sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said to the near kinsman, Naomi, that has come again out of the country of Moab, sells the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it: but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you. And he said, I will redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Boaz said, The day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you buy from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, or else I will mar my own inheritance: you take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can't redeem it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his sandal, and gave it to his fellow man; and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself. And he drew off his sandal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You{+} are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead will not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place: you{+} are witnesses this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. Yahweh make the woman that has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, who both built the house of Israel: and do worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh will give you of this young woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will be to you a restorer of life, and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and was its nurse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And her women neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they named him Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
