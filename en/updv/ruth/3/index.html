Look, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing-floor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself, and put your raiment on you, and go down to the threshing-floor, but don't make yourself known to the man, until he is done eating and drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it will be, when he lies down, that you will mark the place where he will lie, and you will go in, and uncover his feet, and lay down; and he will tell you what you will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she said to her, All that you say I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when Boaz had ate and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself; and saw that a woman lay at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Who are you? And she answered, I am Ruth your slave: spread therefore your skirt over your slave; for you are a near kinsman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Blessed be you of Yahweh, my daughter: you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men, whether poor or rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that you say; for all the city of my people does know that you are a worthy woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And now it is true that I am a near kinsman; nevertheless there is a kinsman nearer than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Tarry this night, and it will be in the morning, that if he will perform to you the part of a kinsman, good; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you, then I will do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives: lie down until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she lay at his feet until the morning.
