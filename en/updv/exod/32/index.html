Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your slaves, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your{+} seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of I will give to your{+} seed, and they will inherit it forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do to his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other they were written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, It is not the voice of those who shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome; but the noise of those who sing, I am hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf and dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it on the water, and made the sons of Israel drink of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Aaron said, Don't let the anger of my lord wax hot: you know the people, that they are [set] on evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they said to me, Make us gods, which will go before us; for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off: so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Moses saw that the people were going wild, (for Aaron had let them go wild for a derision among their enemies,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is on Yahweh's side, [let him come] to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, You{+} put every man his sword on his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man those near to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, You{+} have been consecrated today to Yahweh, yes, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow on you{+} a blessing this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass on the next day, that Moses said to the people, You{+} have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to Yahweh; perhaps I will make atonement for your{+} sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet now, if you will forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him I will blot out of my book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And now go, lead the people to [the place] of which I have spoken to you: look, my angel will go before you; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Yahweh struck the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
