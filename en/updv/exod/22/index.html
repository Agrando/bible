he will pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>If the thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that he dies, there will be no bloodguiltiness for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If the sun is risen on him, there will be bloodguiltiness for him; he will make restitution: if he has nothing, then he will be sold for his theft.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If the theft is found in his hand alive, whether it is ox, or donkey, or sheep, he will pay double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If a man will cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and will let his beast loose, and it feeds in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, he will make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he who kindled the fire will surely make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man will deliver to his fellow man money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man's house; if the thief is found, he will pay double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If the thief is not found, then the master of the house will come near to the gods, [to see] whether he has not put his hand to his fellow man's goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For every matter of trespass, whether it is for ox, for donkey, for sheep, for raiment, [or] for any manner of lost thing, of which one says, This is it, the cause of both parties will come before the gods; he whom the gods will condemn will pay double to his fellow man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If a man delivers to his fellow man a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it dies, or is hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>the oath of Yahweh will be between them both, whether he has not put his hand to his fellow man's goods; and its owner will accept it, and he will not make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But if it is stolen from him, he will make restitution to its owner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness: he will not make good that which was torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man borrows anything of his fellow man, and it is hurt, or dies, its owner not being with it, he will surely make restitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If its owner is with it, he will not make it good: if it is rented, it is included in its rental payment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man entices a virgin who is not betrothed, and lies with her, he will surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If her father completely refuses to give her to him, he will pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You will not allow a witch to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whoever lies with a beast will surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Whoever sacrifices to the gods will be completely destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a sojourner you will not wrong, neither will you oppress him: for you{+} were sojourners in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You{+} will not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you afflict him at all, and he cries at all to me, I will surely hear his cry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and my wrath will wax hot, and I will kill you{+} with the sword; and your{+} wives will be widows, and your{+} sons fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor, you will not be to him as a creditor; neither will you{+} lay on him interest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If you at all take your fellow man's garment to pledge, you will restore it to him before the sun goes down:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: in what will he sleep? And it will come to pass, when he cries to me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You will not revile the gods, nor curse a ruler of your people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You will not delay to offer of your harvest, and of the outflow of your presses. The firstborn of your sons you will give to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Likewise you will do with your oxen, [and] with your sheep: seven days it will be with its dam; on the eighth day you will give it to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And you{+} will be holy men to me: therefore you{+} will not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; you{+} will cast it to the dogs.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
