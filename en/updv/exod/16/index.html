Your{+} murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before Yahweh; for he has heard your{+} murmurings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and saw that the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel: speak to them, saying, At evening you{+} will eat flesh, and in the morning you{+} will be filled with bread: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh your{+} God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it came to pass at evening, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the dew that lay was gone up, look, on the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the frost on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they didn't know what it was. And Moses said to them, It is the bread which Yahweh has given you{+} to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, Gather{+} of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your{+} persons, you{+} will take it, every man for those who are in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the sons of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Moses said to them, Let no man leave of it until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was angry with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, This is that which Yahweh has spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh: bake that which you{+} will bake, and boil that which you{+} will boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves to be kept until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they laid it up until the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh: today you{+} will not find it in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Six days you{+} will gather it; but on the seventh day is the Sabbath, in it there will be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and they found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, How long do you{+} refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>See, since Yahweh has given you{+} the Sabbath, therefore he gives you{+} on the sixth day the bread of two days; remain{+} every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the people rested on the seventh day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the house of Israel called its name Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers [made] with honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses said, This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded, Let a full omer of it be kept throughout your{+} generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you{+} in the wilderness, when I brought you{+} forth from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept throughout your{+} generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they ate the manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
