And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his slaves was changed toward the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel: for the sons of Israel went out with a high hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, saw that the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were very afraid: and the sons of Israel cried out to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than we should die in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses said to the people, Don't be{+} afraid, stand still, and see the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you{+} today: for the Egyptians whom you{+} have seen today, you{+} will see them again no more forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yahweh will fight for you{+}, and you{+} will hold your{+} peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Why do you cry to me? Speak to the sons of Israel, that they go forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it: and the sons of Israel will go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I, look, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them: and I will get myself honor on Pharaoh, and on all his host, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh, when I have gotten myself honor on Pharaoh, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And there was the cloud and the darkness. And it lit up the night. And the one didn't come near the other all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Yahweh caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea on the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Yahweh looked forth on the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he locked their chariot wheels, and they were hard to drive; so the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the sea, that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots, and on their horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen of the whole host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; not so much as one of them remained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did on the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh: and they believed in Yahweh, and in his slave Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
