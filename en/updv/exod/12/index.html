according to every man's eating you{+} will make your{+} count for the lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Your{+} lamb will be without blemish, a male a year old: you{+} will take it from the sheep, or from the goats:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and you{+} will keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel will kill it at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they will take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, on the houses in which they will eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they will eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they will eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Don't eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs and with its insides.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you{+} will let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remains of it until the morning you{+} will burn with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And thus you{+} will eat it: with your{+} loins girded, your{+} sandals on your{+} feet, and your{+} staff in your{+} hand; and you{+} will eat it in a hurry: it is Yahweh's Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the blood will be to you{+} for a token on the houses where you{+} are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you{+}, and there will be no plague on you{+} to destroy you{+}, when I strike the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this day will be to you{+} for a memorial, and you{+} will keep it [as] a feast to Yahweh: throughout your{+} generations you{+} will keep it [as] a feast by an ordinance forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Seven days you{+} will eat unleavened bread; even the first day you{+} will put away leaven out of your{+} houses: for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul will be cut off from Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And in the first day there will be to you{+} a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work will be done in them, except that which every man must eat, only that may be done by you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you{+} will observe the [feast of] unleavened bread; for in this very same day I have brought your{+} hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore you{+} will observe this day throughout your{+} generations by an ordinance forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you{+} will eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Seven days there will be no leaven found in your{+} houses: for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul will be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a sojourner, or one who is born in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You{+} will eat nothing leavened; in all your{+} habitations you{+} will eat unleavened bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and you{+} take lambs according to your{+} families, and kill the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you{+} will take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you{+} will go out of the door of his house until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer to come in to your{+} houses to strike you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you{+} will observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to your sons forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it will come to pass, when you{+} come to the land which Yahweh will give you{+}, according as he has promised, that you{+} will keep this service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it will come to pass, when your{+} sons will say to you{+}, What do you{+} mean by this service?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then you{+} will say, It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when he struck the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the sons of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass at midnight, that Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his slaves, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, you{+} get forth from among my people, both you{+} and the sons of Israel; and go, serve Yahweh, as you{+} have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Take both your{+} flocks and your{+} herds, as you{+} have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Egyptians were urgent on the people, to send them out of the land in a hurry; for they said, We are all dead men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot who were [able-bodied] men, besides children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very many cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now the time that the sons of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the very same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of Yahweh, to be much observed of all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner will eat of it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but every man's slave who is bought for money, when you have circumcised him, then he will eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>A sojourner and a hired worker will not eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>In one house it will be eaten; you will not carry forth anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither will you{+} break a bone of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>All the congregation of Israel will keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when a stranger will sojourn with you, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he will be as one who is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person will eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>One law will be to him who is home-born, and to the stranger who sojourns among you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Thus did all the sons of Israel; as Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass the very same day, that Yahweh brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
