Let my people go, that they may serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For if you refuse to let my people go, look, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your border:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and they will cover the face of the earth, so that one will not be able to see the earth: and they will eat the residue of that which has escaped, which remains to you{+} from the hail, and will eat every tree which grows for you{+} out of the field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and your houses will be filled, and the houses of all your slaves, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were on the earth to this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Pharaoh's slaves said to him, How long will this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh their God: Don't you know yet that Egypt is destroyed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve Yahweh your{+} God; but who are those who will go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds we will go; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, So be Yahweh with you{+}, as I will let you{+} go, and your{+} little ones: look to it; for evil is before you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Not so: now go, you{+} who are [prominent] men, and serve Yahweh; for that is what you{+} desire. And he had them driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail has left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; they were very grievous; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and no green thing remained, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in a hurry; and he said, I have sinned against Yahweh your{+} God, and against you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now therefore forgive, I pray you, my sin only this once, and entreat Yahweh your{+} God, that he may take away from me this death only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Yahweh turned an exceedingly strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust remained in all the border of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch out your hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>they didn't see one another, neither rose anyone from his place for three days: but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, You{+} go, serve Yahweh; only let your{+} flocks and your{+} herds be left behind: let your{+} little ones also go with you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses said, You must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our cattle also will go with us; there will not be a hoof left behind: for we must take of them to serve Yahweh our God; and we don't know with what we must serve Yahweh, until we come there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Pharaoh said to him, You get away from me, take heed to yourself, see my face no more; for in the day you see my face you will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said, You have spoken well.
