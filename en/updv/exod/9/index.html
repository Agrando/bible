But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to yourselves handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it will become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and will be a boil breaking forth with sores on man and on beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with sores on man and on beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the sacred scholars could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were on the sacred scholars, and on all the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For this time I will send all my plagues on your heart, and on your slaves, and on your people; that you may know that there is none like me in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For now I have put forth my hand, and have struck you and your people with pestilence, and you have been cut off from the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but in deed for this very cause I have made you to stand, to show you my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You still exalt yourself against my people, that you will not let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore send, hurry in your cattle and all that you have in the field; [for] all of man and beast that will be found in the field, and will not be brought home, the hail will come down on them, and they will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who feared the word of Yahweh among the slaves of Pharaoh made his slaves and his cattle flee into the houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he who didn't regard the word of Yahweh left his slaves and his cattle in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Stretch forth your hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast, and on every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Yahweh sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth; and Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, from man to beast; and the hail struck every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, there was no hail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Entreat Yahweh; for there has been enough of [these] mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you{+} go, and you{+} will wait no longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh; the thunders will cease, neither will there be anymore hail; that you may know that the earth is Yahweh's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But as for you and your slaves, I know that you{+} will not yet fear Yahweh God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the flax and the barley were struck: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the wheat and the spelt were not struck: for they were not grown up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to Yahweh: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, as Yahweh had spoken by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
