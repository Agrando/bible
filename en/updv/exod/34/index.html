For Yahweh, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Or else, if you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, who prostitute after their gods and sacrifice to their gods, they will call you. And you will eat of their sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when you take of their daughters--who prostitute after their gods--to your sons, then their daughters will make your sons prostitute after their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You will make yourself no molten gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The feast of unleavened bread you will keep. Seven days you will eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib you came out from Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All that opens the womb is mine; and you will separate the males of all your cattle, the firstborns of cow and sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the firstborn of a donkey you will redeem with a lamb: and if you will not redeem, then you will break its neck. All the firstborn of your sons you will redeem. And none will appear before me empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Six days you will work, but on the seventh day you will rest: in plowing time and in harvest you will rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you will observe the feast of weeks, [even] of the first fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Three times in the year will all your males appear before the Sovereign Yahweh, the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I will cast out nations before you, and enlarge your borders: neither will any man desire your land, when you go up to see the face of Yahweh your God three times in the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You will not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither will the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover be left to the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The first of the first fruits of your ground you will bring to the house of Yahweh your God. You will not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, You write these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread, nor drank water. And he wrote on the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses didn't know that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, look, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him: and Moses spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And afterward all the sons of Israel came near: and he gave them in commandment all that Yahweh had spoken with him in mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke to the sons of Israel that which he was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the sons of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
