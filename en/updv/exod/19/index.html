These are the words which you will speak to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people answered together, and said, All that Yahweh has spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Look, I am coming to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe you forever. And Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and be ready against the third day; for the third day Yahweh will come down in the sight of all the people on mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you will set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you{+} don't go up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever touches the mount will be surely put to death:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>no hand will touch him, but he will surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it is beast or man, he will not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they will come up to the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: don't come near a woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceedingly loud; and all the people who were in the camp trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Yahweh descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Yahweh came down on mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, or else they will break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let the priests also, that come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves, or else Yahweh will break forth on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Moses said to Yahweh, The people can't come up to mount Sinai: for you charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Yahweh said to him, Go, get down; and you will come up, you, and Aaron with you: but don't let the priests and the people break through to come up to Yahweh, or else he will break forth on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So Moses went down to the people, and told them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
