and you will anoint it, to sanctify it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Seven days you will make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar will be most holy; whatever touches the altar will be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now this is that which you will offer on the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>The one lamb you will offer in the morning; and the other lamb you will offer at evening:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and with the one lamb a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the other lamb you will offer at evening, and will do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering of it, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It will be a continual burnt-offering throughout your{+} generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh, where I will meet with you{+}, to speak there to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there I will meet with the sons of Israel; and [the Tent] will be sanctified by my glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar: Aaron also and his sons I will sanctify, to serve me in the priest's office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And I will stay among the sons of Israel, and will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they will know that I am Yahweh their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might stay among them: I am Yahweh their God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
