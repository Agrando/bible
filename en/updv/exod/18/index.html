Why do you sit yourself alone, and all the people stand about you from morning to evening?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>when they have a matter, it comes to me; and I judge between a man and his fellow man, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that you do is not good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You will surely wear away, both you, and this people with you: for the thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now listen to my voice, I will give you counsel, and God be with you: be for the people toward God, and you bring the causes to God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and you will teach them the statutes and the laws, and will show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Moreover you will provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it will be, that every great matter they will bring to you, but every small matter they will judge themselves: so it will be easier for yourself, and they will bear [the burden] with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you will be able to endure, and all this people also will go to their place in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
