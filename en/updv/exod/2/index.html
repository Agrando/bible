And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the young woman went and called the child's mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he struck the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he went out the second day, and, look, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him who did the wrong, Why do you strike your fellow man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, Who made you as a man, a prince and a judge over us? Do you think to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and he settled in the land of Midian after having moved to the land of Midian. And [one day] he sat down by a well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you{+} have come so soon today?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that you{+} have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she bore a son, and he named him Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the sons of Israel sighed by reason of the slavery, and they cried, and their cry came up to God by reason of the slavery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
