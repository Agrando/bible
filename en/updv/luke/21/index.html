And what [will be] the sign when these things are about to come to pass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, Take heed that you{+} are not led astray: for many will come in my name, saying, I am [he]; and, The time is at hand: don't go{+} after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when you{+} will hear of wars and tumults, don't be terrified: for these things must surely come to pass first; but the end is not immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to them, Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and there will be great earthquakes, and in diverse places famines and pestilences; and there will be terrors and great signs from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you{+}, and will persecute you{+}, delivering you{+} up to the synagogues and prisons, bringing you{+} before kings and governors for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>It will turn out to you{+} for a testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Settle it therefore in your{+} hearts, not to meditate beforehand how to answer:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for I will give you{+} a mouth and wisdom, which all your{+} adversaries will not be able to withstand or to gainsay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But you{+} will be delivered up even by parents, and brothers, and kinsfolk, and friends; and [some] of you{+} they will cause to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you{+} will be hated of all men for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And not a hair of your{+} head will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>In your{+} patience you{+} win your{+} souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But when you{+} see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains; and let those who are inside her depart out; and don't let those who are in the country enter into her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse in those days! For there will be great distress on the land, and wrath to this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations: and Jerusalem will be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars; and on the earth distress of nations, in perplexity for the roaring of the sea and the billows;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men fainting for fear, and for expectation of the things which are coming upon the world: for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when these things begin to come to pass, look up, and lift up your{+} heads; because your{+} redemption draws near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spoke to them a parable: Look at the fig tree, and all the trees:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>when they now shoot forth, you{+} see it and know of your{+} own selves that the summer is now near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Even so you{+} also, when you{+} see these things coming to pass, know{+} that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Truly I say to you{+}, This generation will not pass away, until all things be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Heaven and earth will pass away: but my words will not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But take heed to yourselves, lest perhaps your{+} hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that day come upon you{+} suddenly as a snare:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for [so] it will come upon all those who dwell on the face of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But watch{+} at every season, making supplication, that you{+} may prevail to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And every day he was teaching in the temple; and every night he went out, and lodged in the mount that is called of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
