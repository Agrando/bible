Render the account of your stewardship; for you can no longer be steward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the steward said to himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord takes away the stewardship from me? I don't have strength to dig; I am ashamed to beg.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe to my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He says to him, Take your bond, and write eighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this age are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you{+}, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it will fail, they may receive you{+} into the eternal tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he who is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore you{+} haven't been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your{+} trust the true [riches]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if you{+} haven't been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you{+} that which is your{+} own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No household slave can serve as a slave to two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to one, and despise the other. You{+} can't serve as a slave to God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, You{+} are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knows your{+} hearts: for that which is exalted among men is disgusting in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets [were] until John: from that time the good news of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man enters violently into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery: and he who marries her who has been divorced from a husband commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and desiring to be fed with the [crumbs] that fell from the rich man's table; yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham's bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham far off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Abraham said, Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted and you are in anguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And besides all this, between us and you{+} there is a great gulf fixed, that those who would pass from here to you{+} may not be able, and that none may cross over from there to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, I pray you therefore, father, that you would send him to my father's house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for I have five brothers; that he may testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Abraham says, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, No, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, If they don't hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one would rise from the dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
