As he said these things, he cried, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And his disciples asked him what this parable might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, To you{+} it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to the rest in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And those by the wayside are the ones who have heard; then the devil comes, and takes away the word from their heart, that they may not believe and be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And those on the rock [are] they who, when they have heard, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for awhile believe, and in time of trial fall away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And that which fell among the thorns, these are those who have heard, and as they go on their way they are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of [this] life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And that in the good ground, these are such as in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, hold it fast, and bring forth fruit with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And no man, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel, or puts it under a bed; but puts it on a lampstand, that those who enter in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For nothing is hid, that will not be made manifest; nor [anything] secret, that will not be known and come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Take heed therefore how you{+} hear: for whoever has, to him will be given; and whoever does not have, from him will be taken away even that which he thinks he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And there came to him his mother and brothers, and they could not come at him for the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it was told him, Your mother and your brothers stand outside, desiring to see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he answered and said to them, My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God, and do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now it came to pass on one of those days, that he entered into a boat, himself and his disciples; and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake: and they launched forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filling [with water], and were in jeopardy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. And he awoke, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, Where is your{+} faith? And being afraid they marveled, saying one to another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he came forth on the land, there met him a certain man out of the city, who had demons; and for a long time he had worn no clothes, and did not stay in [any] house, but in the tombs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I urge you, don't torment me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For he commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For oftentimes it had seized him: and he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters; and breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the deserts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus asked him, What is your name? And he said, Legion; for many demons went into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they entreated him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now there was there a herd of many swine being shepherded on the mountain: and they entreated him that he would give them leave to enter into them. And he gave them leave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the demons came out from the man, and entered into the swine: and the herd rushed down the steep into the lake, and were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when those who shepherded them saw what had come to pass, they fled, and told it in the city and in the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they went out to see what had come to pass; and they came to Jesus, and found the man, from whom the demons went out, sitting, clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus: and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And those who saw it told them how he who was possessed with demons was made whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And all the people around the country of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, for they were held with great fear: and he entered into a boat, and returned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the man from whom the demons had gone out prayed him that he might be with him: but he sent him away, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Return to your house, and declare how much God has done for you. And he went his way, publishing throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And as Jesus returned, the multitude welcomed him; for they were all waiting for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And look, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and implored him to come into his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for he had an only begotten daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as he went the multitudes thronged him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And a woman having a discharge of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living on physicians, unable to be healed by anyone,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately the discharge of her blood stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jesus said, Who is it that touched me? And when all denied, Peter said, Master, the multitudes press you and crush [you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But Jesus said, Some one did touch me; for I perceived that power had gone forth from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people for what cause she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>While he yet spoke, there comes one from the ruler of the synagogue's [house], saying, Your daughter is dead; Don't trouble the Teacher any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jesus hearing it, answered him, Don't be afraid: only believe, and she will be made whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And when he came to the house, he didn't allow any man to enter in with him, except Peter, and John, and James, and the girl's father and her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all were weeping, and bewailing her: but he said, Do not weep; for she is not dead, but sleeps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But he, taking her by the hand, called, saying, Girl, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her spirit returned, and she rose up immediately: and he commanded that [something] be given her to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And her parents were amazed: but he charged them to tell no man what had been done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
