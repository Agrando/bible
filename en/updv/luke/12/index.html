Don't be afraid: you{+} are of more value than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I say to you{+}, Everyone who will confess me before men, the Son of Man will also confess him before the angels of God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but he who denies me in the presence of men will be denied in the presence of the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And everyone who will speak a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him: but to him who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit it will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they bring you{+} before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, don't be anxious how or what you{+} will answer, or what you{+} will say:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the Holy Spirit will teach you{+} in that very hour what you{+} ought to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And one out of the multitude said to him, Teacher, bid my brother divide the inheritance with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he said to him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you{+}?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, Take heed, and keep yourselves from all greed: for a man's life does not consist in the abundance of the things which he possesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he spoke a parable to them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he reasoned to himself, saying, What shall I do, because I don't have a place to bestow my fruits?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, I will do this: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there I will bestow all my grain and my goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, Soul, you have much goods laid up for many years; take your ease, eat, drink, be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said to him, You foolish one, this [is] the night they demand back your soul from you; and the things which you have prepared, whose will they be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you{+}, Don't be anxious for [your{+}] life, what you{+} will eat; nor yet for [your{+}] body, what you{+} will put on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the life is more than the food, and the body than the clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens, that they do not sow, neither reap; which have no store-chamber nor barn; and God feeds them: of how much more value are you{+} than the birds!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you{+} by being anxious can add a cubit to the measure of his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If then you{+} are not able to do even that which is least, why are you{+} anxious concerning the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not toil, neither do they spin; yet I say to you{+}, Even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if God so clothes the grass in the field, which today is [here], and tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more [he will clothe] you{+}, O you{+} of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And don't you{+} seek what you{+} will eat, and what you{+} will drink, neither be{+} of doubtful mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For all these things the nations of the world seek after: but your{+} Father knows that you{+} have need of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet seek{+} his kingdom, and these things will be added to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Don't be afraid, little flock; for it is your{+} Father's good pleasure to give you{+} the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell that which you{+} have, and give alms; make for yourselves wallets which do not wear out, a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief draws near, neither moth destroys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your{+} treasure is, there will your{+} heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let your{+} loins be girded about, and your{+} lamps burning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and be{+} yourselves like men looking for their lord, when he will return from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may right away open to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed are those slaves, whom the lord when he comes will find watching: truly I say to you{+}, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and will come and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if he will come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find [them] so, blessed are those [slaves].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You{+} also be ready: for in an hour that you{+} do not think the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Peter said, Lord, do you speak this parable to us, or even to all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, Who then is the faithful and wise steward, whom his lord will set over his household, to give them their portion of food in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed is that slave, whom his lord when he comes will find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Of a truth I say to you{+}, that he will set him over all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if that slave will say in his heart, My lord delays his coming; and will begin to beat the male slaves and the female slaves, and to eat and drink, and to be drunk;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the lord of that slave will come in a day when he does not expect, and in an hour when he does not know, and will cut him apart, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that slave, who knew his lord's will, and did not make ready, nor did according to his will, will be beaten with many [stripes];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>but he who did not know, and did things worthy of stripes, will be beaten with few [stripes]. And to whomever much is given, of him will much be required: and to whom they commit much, of him they will ask the more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I came to cast fire on the earth; and how I want that it were already kindled!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how I am straitened until it is accomplished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Do you{+} think that I have come to give peace in the earth? I tell you{+}, No; but rather division:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>for there will be from now on five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They will be divided, father against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother; mother in law against her daughter in law, and daughter in law against her mother in law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he said to the multitudes also, When you{+} see the cloud rising in the west, right away you{+} say, There comes a shower; and so it comes to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when [you{+} see] a south wind blowing, you{+} say, There will be a scorching heat; and it comes to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>You{+} hypocrites, you{+} know how to interpret the face of the earth and the heaven; but how is it that you{+} don't know how to interpret this time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And why even of yourselves don't you{+} judge what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For as you are going with your adversary before the magistrate, on the way work hard to be released from him; lest perhaps he drag you to the judge, and the judge will deliver you to the officer, and the officer will cast you into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I say to you, You will by no means come out from there, until you have paid the very last dollar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
