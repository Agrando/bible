And they stood still, looking sad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said to him, Do you alone sojourn [in] Jerusalem and not know the things which have come to pass there in these days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man [who was] a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yes and besides all these things, this is now the third day since these things came to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and when they didn't find his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but they didn't see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Didn't it behoove the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they drew near to the village, where they were going: and he made as though he would go further.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to stay with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking [it] he gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said one to another, Wasn't our heart burning inside us, while he spoke to us in the way, while he opened to us the Scriptures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they rehearsed the things [that happened] in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they spoke these things, he himself stood among them, and says to them, Peace [be] to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they saw a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, Why are you{+} troubled? And why do questionings arise in your{+} heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones, as you{+} see me having.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you{+} here anything to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he took it, and ate before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said to them, These are my words which I spoke to you{+}, while I was yet with you{+}, that all things must surely be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he opened their mind, that they might understand the Scriptures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and he said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that repentance unto remission of sins should be preached in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>You{+} are witnesses of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And look, I send the promise of my Father on you{+}: but you{+} tarry in the city, until you{+} are clothed with power from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he led them out until [they were] across from Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
