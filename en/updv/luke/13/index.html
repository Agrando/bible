And to what shall I liken it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his own garden; and it grew, and became a tree; and the birds of the heaven lodged in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And again he said, To what shall I liken the kingdom of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And one said to him, Lord, are there few who are saved? And he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say to you{+}, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut to the door, and you{+} begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, open to us; and he will answer and say to you{+}, I don't know you{+} or where you{+} are from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then you{+} will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he will speak, saying to you{+}, I don't know you{+} or where you{+} are from; depart from me, all you{+} workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when you{+} will see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they will come from the east and west, and from the north and south, and will sit down in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And look, there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get out, and go from here: for Herod wants to kill you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said to them, Go and say to that fox, Look, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third [day] I am perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the [day] following: for it cannot be that a prophet perishes out of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, even as a hen [gathers] her own brood under her wings, and you{+} did not want [to]!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Look, your{+} house is left to you{+}: and I say to you{+}, You{+} will not see me until the time comes when you{+} will say, Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
