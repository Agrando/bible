And he arose and stood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jesus said to them, I ask you{+}, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to destroy it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he looked around on them all, and said to him, Stretch forth your hand. And he did [so]: and his hand was restored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Matthew and Thomas, and James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Judas [the son] of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed [them] all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed [are] you{+} poor: for yours{+} is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed [are] you{+} who hunger now: for you{+} will be filled. Blessed [are] you{+} who weep now: for you{+} will laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed are you{+}, when men will hate you{+}, and when they will separate you{+} [from their company], and reproach you{+}, and cast out your{+} name as evil, for the Son of Man's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice in that day, and leap [for joy]: for look, your{+} reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner their fathers did to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But woe to you{+} who are rich! For you{+} have received your{+} consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you{+}, you{+} who are full now! For you{+} will hunger. Woe [to you{+}], you{+} who laugh now! For you{+} will mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe [to you{+}], when all men will speak well of you{+}! For in the same manner their fathers did to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say to you{+} who hear, Love your{+} enemies, do good to those who hate you{+},</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless those who curse you{+}, pray for those who despitefully use you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To him who strikes you on the [one] cheek offer also the other; and from him who takes away your cloak don't withhold your coat also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to everyone who asks you; and of him who takes away your goods don't ask [for them] back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you{+} would that men should do to you{+}, do{+} to them likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And if you{+} love those who love you{+}, what thanks do you{+} have? For even sinners love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For even if you{+} do good to those who do good to you{+}, what thanks do you{+} have? Even sinners do the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you{+} lend to them of whom you{+} hope to receive, what thanks is it to you{+}? Even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your{+} enemies, and do [them] good, and lend, never despairing; and your{+} reward will be great, and you{+} will be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be{+} merciful, even as your{+} Father is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And do not judge, and you{+} will not be judged: and do not condemn, and you{+} will not be condemned: release, and you{+} will be released:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>give, and it will be given to you{+}; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, they will give into your{+} bosom. For with what measure you{+} mete it will be measured to you{+} again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he spoke also a parable to them, Can the blind guide the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple is not above his teacher: but everyone when he is fully trained will be as his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why do you look at the mote that is in your brother's eye, but don't consider the beam that is in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in your eye, when you yourself don't look at the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to cast out the mote that is in your brother's eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For there is no good tree producing corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree producing good fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For each tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush do they gather grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good; and the evil [man] out of the evil [treasure] brings forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And why call{+} me, Lord, Lord, and not do the things which I say?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Everyone who comes to me, and hears my words, and does them, I will show you{+} to whom he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>he is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep, and laid a foundation on the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But he who hears [my words], and does not [do them], is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation; against which the stream broke, and immediately it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
