Don't go from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And into whatever city you{+} enter, and they receive you{+}, eat such things as are set before you{+}:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and heal the sick who are in it, and say to them, The kingdom of God has come near to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But into whatever city you{+} will enter, and they do not receive you{+}, go out into its streets and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even the dust from your{+} city, that sticks to our feet, we wipe off against you{+}: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has come near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I say to you{+}, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you{+}, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who hears you{+} hears me; and he who rejects you{+} rejects me; and he who rejects me rejects him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to them, I watched Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Look, I have given you{+} authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing will in any wise hurt you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless don't rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you{+}; but rejoice that your{+} names are written in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to juveniles: yes, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All things have been delivered to me of my Father: and no one knows who the Son is, except the Father; and who the Father is, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son wills to reveal [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that you{+} see:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for I say to you{+}, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which you{+} see, and did not see them; and to hear the things which you{+} hear, and did not hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And look, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read [it]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And answering he said, You will love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your fellow man as yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to him, You have answered right: do this, and you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my fellow man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus replying said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on [them] oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on the next day he took out $200, and gave it to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatever you spend more, I, when I come back again, will repay you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Which of these three, do you think, had been the fellow man of him who fell among the robbers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said, He who showed mercy on him. And Jesus said to him, Go, and you do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at the Lord's feet, and heard his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha was cumbered about much service; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, don't you care that my sister left me to serve alone? Then tell her to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But the Lord answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious and upset about many things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but one thing is needful: for Mary has chosen the good part, which will not be taken away from her.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
