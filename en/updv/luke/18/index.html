Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke also this parable to certain ones, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nothing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee stood and prayed these things to himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the publican, standing far off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but struck his breast, saying, God, be merciful to me a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I say to you{+}, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled; but he who humbles himself will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they were bringing to him also their babies, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus called them to him, saying, Allow the little children to come to me, and don't forbid them: for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly I say to you{+}, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he will in no way enter in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? None is good but one, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, All these things I have observed from youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Jesus heard it, he said to him, One thing you lack yet: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he heard these things, he became exceedingly sorrowful; for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus seeing him become exceedingly sorrowful said, How hard it is for those having riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And those who heard it said, Then who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter said, Look, we have left our own, and followed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, Truly I say to you{+}, There is no man who has left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who will not receive manifold more in this time, and in the age to come eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he took to him the twelve, and said to them, Look, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets will be accomplished to the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he will be delivered up to the Gentiles, and will be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit on:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and they will scourge and kill him: and the third day he will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they didn't perceive the things that were said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass, as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried out, saying, Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Son of David, have mercy on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he came near, he asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>What do you want that I should do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight; your faith has made you whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
