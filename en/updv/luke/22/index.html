Isn't it he who sits at meat? But I am among you{+} as he who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But you{+} are those who have continued with me in my trials;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I appoint to you{+}, even as my Father appointed to me, a kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that you{+} may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you{+} will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Simon, Simon, look, Satan asked to have you{+}, that he might sift you{+} as wheat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I made supplication for you, that your faith does not fail; and you, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said to him, Lord, I am ready to go both to prison and to death with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow this day, until you have thrice denied that you know me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, When I sent you{+} forth without wallet, and bag, and sandals, did you{+} lack anything? And they said, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to them, But now, he who has a wallet, let him take it, and likewise a bag; and he who has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I say to you{+}, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerns me has fulfillment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they said, Lord, look, here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he came out, and went, as his custom was, to the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he was at the place, he said to them, Pray that you{+} do not enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he was parted from them about a stone's cast; and he knelt down and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but yours, be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and said to them, Why do you{+} sleep? Rise and pray, that you{+} do not enter into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he yet spoke, look, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said to him, Judas, do you deliver up the Son of Man with a kiss?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And when those who were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus answered and said, Allow{+} [them] thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that had come upon him, As upon a robber, did you{+} come out with swords and staves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I was daily with you{+} in the temple, you{+} did not stretch forth your{+} hands against me: but this is your{+} hour, and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they seized him, and led him [away], and brought him into the high priest's house. But Peter followed far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a certain female slave seeing him as he sat in the light [of the fire], and looking steadfastly on him, said, This man also was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied, saying, Woman, I don't know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while another saw him, and said, You also are [one] of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But Peter said, Man, I don't know what you say. And immediately, while he yet spoke, the rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned, and looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how that he said to him, Before the rooster crows this day you will deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men who held [Jesus] mocked him, and beat him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And they blindfolded him, and asked, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other things they spoke against him, reviling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their Sanhedrin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>saying, If you are the Christ, tell us. But he said to them, If I tell you{+}, you{+} will not believe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if I ask [you{+}], you{+} will not answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But from now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And they all said, Are you then the Son of God? And he said to them, You{+} say that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, What further need do we have of witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
