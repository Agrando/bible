And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he fell on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? But where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Were there none found that returned to give glory to God, except this stranger?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Arise, and go your way: your faith has made you whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>neither will they say, Look, here! Or, There! For look, the kingdom of God is inside you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you{+} will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you{+} will not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say to you{+}, Look, there! Or, Look, here! Don't go away, nor follow after [them]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for as the lightning, when it flashes out of the one part under the heaven, shines to the other part under heaven; so will the Son of Man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so it will be also in the days of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but in the day that Lot went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>after the same manner it will be in the day that the Son of Man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he who will be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him who is in the field likewise not return back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever will seek to gain his life will lose it: but whoever will lose [his life] will preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I say to you{+}, In that night there will be two men on one bed; the one will be taken, and the other will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There will be two women grinding together; the one will be taken, and the other will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And answering they say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body [is], there will the eagles also be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
