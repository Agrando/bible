And he divided to them his living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went and stuck [close] to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to shepherd swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he desired to have filled his belly with the pods that the swine ate: and no man gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when he came to himself he said, How many hired workers of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am no more worthy to be called your{+} son: make me as one of your hired workers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose, and came to his father. But while he was yet far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight: I am no more worthy to be called your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the father said to his slaves, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and bring the fatted calf, [and] kill it, and let us eat, and make merry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he called to him one of the [household] slaves, and inquired what these things might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he answered and said to his father, Look, these many years I serve you as a slave, and I never transgressed a commandment of yours; and [yet] you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but when this your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed for him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to him, Child, you are ever with me, and all that is mine is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this your brother was dead, and is alive [again]; and [was] lost, and is found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
