And he sat down and taught the multitudes out of the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he had left speaking, he said to Simon, Put out into the deep, and let down your{+} nets for a catch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Simon answered and said, Master, we toiled all night, and took nothing: but at your word I will let down the nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when they had done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fish; and their nets were breaking;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and they beckoned to their sharers in the other boat, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he was amazed, and all who were with him, at the catch of the fish which they had taken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and so were also James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Don't be afraid; from now on you will catch men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they had brought their boats to land, they left all, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it came to pass, while he was in one of the cities, look, a man full of leprosy: and when he saw Jesus, he fell on his face, and implored him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be made clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he charged him to tell no man: but go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, according to as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But so much the more went abroad the report concerning him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed of their infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he withdrew himself in the deserts, and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass on one of those days, that he was teaching; and there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who had come out of every village of Galilee and Judea and Jerusalem: and the power of Yahweh was with him to heal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And look, men bring on a bed a man who was palsied: and they sought to bring him in, and to lay him before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And not finding by what [way] they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went up to the housetop, and let him down through the tiles with his couch into the middle [of everyone] before Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And seeing their faith, he said, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus perceiving their reasonings, answered and said to them, Why do you{+} reason in your{+} hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that you{+} may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he said to him who was palsied: I say to you, Arise, and take up your couch, and go to your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that on which he lay, and departed to his house, glorifying God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And amazement took hold on all, and they glorified God; and they were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after these things he went forth, and noticed a publican, named Levi, sitting at the place of toll, and said to him, Follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he forsook all, and rose up and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made him a great feast in his house: and there was a great multitude of publicans and of others who were sitting at meat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the Pharisees and their scribes murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you{+} eat and drink with the publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jesus answering said to them, Those who are in health have no need of a physician; but those who are sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they said to him, The disciples of John fast often, and make supplications; likewise also the [disciples] of the Pharisees; but yours eat and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, Can you{+} make the sons of the bride-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will come; and when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he spoke also a parable to them: No man rends a piece from a new garment and puts it on an old garment; else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not agree with the old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no man puts new wine into old wineskins; else the new wine will burst the skins, and itself will be spilled, and the skins will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And no man having drank old [wine] desires new; for he says, The old is good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
