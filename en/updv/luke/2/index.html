and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were shepherds in the same country living in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And an angel of Yahweh stood by them, and the glory of Yahweh shone around them: and they were greatly afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the angel said to them, Don't be afraid; for look, I bring you{+} good news of great joy which will be to all the people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for there is born to you{+} this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this [will be] the sign to you{+}: You{+} will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Glory to God in the highest, And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came in a hurry, and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all who heard it wondered at the things which were spoken to them by the shepherds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Mary kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called Jesus, which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(as it is written in the law of Yahweh, Every male that opens the womb will be called holy to the Lord),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of Yahweh, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And look, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen Yahweh's Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then he received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now let your slave depart, O Sovereign Yahweh, According to your word, in peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my eyes have seen your salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which you have prepared before the face of all peoples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>A light for revelation to the Gentiles, And the glory of your people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And his father and his mother were marveling at the things which were spoken concerning him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Look, this [child] is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and a sword will pierce through your own soul also; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and she had been a widow even to eighty-four years), who did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasts and supplications night and day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all those who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of Yahweh, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents didn't know it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day's journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said to him, Child, why have you thus dealt with us? Look, your father and I sought you sorrowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he said to them, How is it that you{+} sought me? Did you{+} not know that I must be in my Father's house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they didn't understand the saying which he spoke to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject to them: and his mother kept all [these] sayings in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
