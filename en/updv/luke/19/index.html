You knew that I am an austere man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then why didn't you give my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have collected it with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to those who stood by, Take away from him the $1,000, and give it to him who has the $10,000.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said to him, Lord, he has $10,000.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I say to you{+}, that to everyone who has will be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But these enemies of mine, that did not want that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay them before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had thus spoken, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount that is called, of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, Go your{+} way into the village across from [you{+}]; in which as you{+} enter you{+} will find a colt tied, on which no man ever yet sat: and having loosed him, bring him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if anyone asks you{+}, Why do you{+} loose him? Thus you{+} will say, The Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And those who were sent, went away, and found even as he had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said to them, Why do you{+} loose the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said, The Lord has need of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought him to Jesus: and they threw their garments on the colt, and set Jesus on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as he was now drawing near, [even] at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works which they had seen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying, Blessed [is] he who comes, the King, in the name of Yahweh: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees from the multitude said to him, Teacher, rebuke your disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he answered and said, I tell you{+}, if these will hold their peace, the stones will cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he drew near, he saw the city and wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, If you had known in this day, even you, the things which belong to peace! But now they are hid from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For the days will come upon you, when your enemies will cast up a bank about you, and circle you round, and keep you in on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and will dash you to the ground, and your children inside you; and they will not leave in you one stone on another; because you didn't know the time of your visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he entered into the temple, and began to cast out those who sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, It is written, And my house will be a house of prayer: but you{+} have made it a den of robbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the principal men of the people sought to destroy him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>and they could not find what they might do; for the people all hung on him, listening.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
