For I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, that stands in the presence of God; and I was sent to speak to you, and to bring you this good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And look, you will be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things will come to pass, because you didn't believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their season.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled while he tarried in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs to them, and remained mute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it came to pass, when the days of his ministry were fulfilled, he departed to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus has Yahweh done to me in the days in which he looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to the wife of a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and her name was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he came in to her, and said, Hail, you who are highly favored, the Lord [is] with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and reasoned within herself what manner of salutation this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said to her, Don't be afraid, Mary: for you have found favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And look, you will conceive in your womb, and bring forth a son, and will call his name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High: and Yahweh God will give to him the throne of his father David:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Mary said to the angel, How will this be? I am not able to have children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore, the holy one who is begotten will be called the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And look, Elizabeth your kinswoman, in her old age, she also has conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For nothing will be impossible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Mary said, Look, [I am] Yahweh's slave; let it happen to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country in a hurry, into a city of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed [are] you among women, and blessed [is] the fruit of your womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And how is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For look, when the voice of your salutation came into my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed [is] she who believed; for there will be a fulfillment of the things which have been spoken to her from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>For he has looked on the low [position] of his slave: For look, from now on all generations will call me blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For he who is mighty has done to me great things; And holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his mercy is to generations and generations On those who fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He has shown strength with his arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He has put down princes from [their] thrones, And has exalted them of low degree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The hungry he has filled with good things; And the rich he has sent empty away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He has given help to Israel his son, That he might remember mercy</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>(As he spoke to our fathers) Toward Abraham and his seed forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now Elizabeth's time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that Yahweh had magnified his mercy toward her; and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of the father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he will be called John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said to her, There is none of your kindred who is called by this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue [loosed], and he spoke, blessing God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came upon all who dwelt around them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? For the hand of Yahweh was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed [be] Yahweh, the God of Israel; For he has visited and made redemption for his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And has raised up a horn of salvation for us In the house of his son David</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>(As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>To show mercy toward, our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>The oath which he spoke to Abraham our father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>To grant to us that we being delivered out of the hand of [our] enemies Should serve him without fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>Yes and you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High: For you will go before Yahweh to make ready his ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>To give knowledge of salvation to his people In the remission of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Because of the tender mercy of our God, By which the rising sun from on high will visit us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>To shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death; To guide our feet into the way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts until the day of his showing to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
