Your kingdom come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Give us day by day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And forgive us our sins; for we ourselves also forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Which of you{+} will have a friend, and will go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he from inside will answer and say, Don't trouble me: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I can't rise and give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I say to you{+}, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you{+}, Ask, and it will be given you{+}; seek, and you{+} will find; knock, and it will be opened to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For everyone who asks receives; and he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And of which of you{+} who is a father will his son ask for a fish, and he for a fish gives him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Or [if] he will ask an egg, will he give him a scorpion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If you{+} then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your{+} children, how much more will [your{+}] heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he was casting out a demon, and it was mute. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the mute man spoke; and the multitudes marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some of them said, By Beelzebul the prince of the demons he casts out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And others, trying [him], sought of him a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house [divided] against a house falls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if Satan also is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? because you{+} say that I cast out demons by Beelzebul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your{+} sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your{+} judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, if by the finger of God I cast out demons, then has the kingdom of God come upon you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When the strong [man] fully armed guards his own court, his goods are in peace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but when a stronger than he will come upon him, and overcome him, he takes from him his whole armor in which he trusted, and divides his spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who is not with me is against me; and he who does not gather with me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When the unclean spirit goes out of the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest and not finding [any]. Then it says, I will turn back to my house from where I came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when it comes, it finds it swept and garnished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more evil than itself; and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, as he said these things, a certain woman out of the multitude lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts that nursed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he said, On the contrary, blessed are those who hear the word of God, and keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when the multitudes were gathering together to him, he began to say, This generation is an evil generation: it seeks after a sign; and there will be no sign given to it but the sign of Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For even as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will also the Son of Man be to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The queen of the south will rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and will condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and look, a greater than Solomon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The men of Nineveh will stand up in the judgment with this generation, and will condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and look, a greater than Jonah is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>No man, when he has lit a lamp, puts it in a cellar, neither under the bushel, but on the lampstand, that those which enter in may see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The lamp of your body is your eye: when your eye is single, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is evil, your body also is full of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Look therefore whether the light that is in you is not darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If therefore your whole body is full of light, having no dark part, it will be wholly full of light, as when the lamp with its bright shining gives you light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now as he spoke, a Pharisee asks him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first bathed himself before dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the Lord said to him, Now you{+} the Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter; but your{+} inward part is full of extortion and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You{+} foolish ones, did not he who made the outside make the inside also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But clean those things which are inside; and look, all of you{+} is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But woe to you{+} Pharisees! For you{+} tithe mint and dill and every herb, and pass over justice and the love of God: but these you{+} ought to have done, and not to neglect the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Woe to you{+} Pharisees! For you{+} love the chief seats in the synagogues, and the salutations in the marketplaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Woe to you{+}! For you{+} are as the tombs which do not appear, and the men who walk over [them] do not know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And one of the lawyers answering says to him, Teacher, in saying this you reproach us also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said, Woe to you{+} lawyers also! For you{+} load men with loads grievous to be borne, and you{+} yourselves don't touch the loads with one of your{+} fingers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Woe to you{+}! For you{+} build the tombs of the prophets, and your{+} fathers killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So you{+} are witnesses and give your{+} approval to the works of your{+} fathers: for they killed them, and you{+} build [their tombs].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Therefore the wisdom of God also said, I will send to them prophets and apostles; and [some] of them they will kill and persecute;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>that the blood of all the prophets, having been shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary: yes, I say to you{+}, it will be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Woe to you{+} lawyers! For you{+} took away the key of knowledge: you{+} didn't enter in yourselves, and those who were entering in you{+} hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when he came out from there, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press on [him] vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>laying wait for him, to catch something out of his mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
