as Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the officers who were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near to Moses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and they said to Moses, Your slaves have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And we have brought Yahweh's oblation, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, earrings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to Yahweh, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>([For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the sons of Israel before Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
