they will eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>they will leave none of it to the morning, nor break a bone of it: according to all the statute of the Passover they will keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbears to keep the Passover, that soul will be cut off from his people; because he didn't offer the oblation of Yahweh in its appointed season, that man will bear his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a stranger will sojourn among you{+}, and will keep the Passover to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so he will do: you{+} will have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him who is born in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at evening it was on the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it always was: the cloud covered it and by night [had] the appearance of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the sons of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud stayed, there the sons of Israel encamped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At the commandment of Yahweh the sons of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped: as long as the cloud stayed on the tabernacle they remained encamped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the cloud tarried on the tabernacle many days, then the sons of Israel kept the charge of Yahweh, and didn't journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle;
