her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, he will burn:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the priest will take cedar-wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the priest will wash his clothes, and he will bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he will come into the camp, and the priest will be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he who burns her will wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and will be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a man who is clean will gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up outside the camp in a clean place; and it will be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for a water for impurity: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer will wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it will be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger who sojourns among them, for a statute forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who touches any dead body of man will be unclean seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the same will purify himself with it [the water] on the third day, and on the seventh day, and he will be clean: but if he does not purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he will not be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Whoever touches a dead person, the body of man who dies, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Yahweh; and that soul will be cut off from Israel: because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he will be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This is the law when man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, will be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a bone of man, or a grave, will be unclean seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And for the unclean they will take of the ashes of the burning of the sin-offering; and running water will be put thereto in a vessel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and a clean person will take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone, or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the clean person will sprinkle on the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he will purify him; and he will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and will be clean at evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the man who will be unclean, and will not purify himself, that soul will be cut off from the midst of the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh: the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it will be a perpetual statute to them: and he who sprinkles the water for impurity will wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity will be unclean until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever the unclean person touches will be unclean;
