For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Yahweh, and against you; pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, You make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it will come to pass, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Moses made a serpent of bronze, and set it on the standard: and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of bronze, he lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the sons of Israel journeyed, and encamped in Oboth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they journeyed from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>From there they journeyed, and encamped in the valley of Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From there they journeyed, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Yahweh, Vaheb in Suphah, And the valleys of the Arnon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the slope of the valleys that inclines toward the dwelling of Ar, And leans on the border of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from there [they journeyed] to Beer: that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Israel sang this song: Spring up, O well; you{+} sing to it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The well, which the princes dug, Which the nobles of the people delved, With the scepter, [and] with their poles. And from the wilderness [they journeyed] to Mattanah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the sons of Ammon; for the border of the sons of Ammon was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, You{+} come to Heshbon; Let the city of Sihon be built and established:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For a fire has gone out of Heshbon, A flame from the city of Sihon: It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, O people of Chemosh: He has given his sons as fugitives, And his daughters into captivity, To Sihon king of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, And we have laid waste until the fire is kindled, which [reaches] to Medeba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its towns, and the Amorites who were there were driven out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Don't fear him: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you will do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was left him none remaining: and they possessed his land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
