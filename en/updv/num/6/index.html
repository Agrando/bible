he will drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither will he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All the days of his separation he will eat nothing that is made of the grapevine, from the kernels even to the husk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>All the days of his vow of separation no razor will come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in which he separates himself to Yahweh, he will be holy; he will let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All the days that he separates himself to Yahweh he will not come near to a dead body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He will not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die; because his separation to God is on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head of his separation; then he will shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day he will shave it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And on the eighth day he will bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tent of meeting:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and the priest will offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, and make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the dead, and will hallow his head that same day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will separate to Yahweh the days of his separation, and will bring a he-lamb a year old for a trespass-offering; but the former days will be void, because his separation was defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And this is the law of the Nazirite, when the days of his separation are fulfilled: he will be brought to the door of the tent of meeting:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he will offer his oblation to Yahweh, one he-lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering, and one ewe-lamb a year old without blemish for a sin-offering, and one ram without blemish for peace-offerings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest will present them before Yahweh, and will offer his sin-offering, and his burnt-offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he will offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest will offer also the meal-offering of it, and the drink-offering of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Nazirite will shave the head of his separation at the door of the tent of meeting, and will take the hair of the head of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of peace-offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the priest will take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and will put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has shaven [the head of] his separation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the priest will wave them for a wave-offering before Yahweh; this is holy for the priest, together with the wave-breast and heave-thigh: and after that the Nazirite may drink wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the law of the Nazirite who vows, [and of] his oblation to Yahweh for his separation, besides that which he is able to get: according to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law of his separation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, On this wise you{+} will bless the sons of Israel: you{+} will say to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yahweh bless you, and keep you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yahweh make his face to shine on you, and be gracious to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yahweh lift up his countenance on you, and give you peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they will put my name on the sons of Israel;
