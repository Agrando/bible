And the sons of Israel will lay their hands on the Levites:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Aaron will offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the sons of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Levites will lay their hands on the heads of the bullocks: and he [Aaron] will make of one of them a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you will set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus you will separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel; and the Levites will be mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after that the Levites will go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and you will cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For they are wholly given to me from among the sons of Israel; instead of all that opens the womb, even the firstborn of all the sons of Israel, I have taken them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For all the firstborn among the sons of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, to do the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the sons of Israel; that there will be no plague among the sons of Israel, when the sons of Israel come near to the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the Levites: according to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the sons of Israel to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Aaron offered them for a wave-offering before Yahweh; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>This is that which belongs to the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they will go in to wait on the service in the work of the tent of meeting:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and from the age of fifty years they will cease waiting on the work, and will serve no more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>but will minister with their brothers in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and will do no service. Thus you will do to the Levites concerning their charges.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
