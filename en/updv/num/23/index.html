And he went to a bare height.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And God met Balaam: and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Yahweh put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he returned to him, and, look, he was standing by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took up his parable, and said, From Aram has Balak brought me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: Come, curse Jacob for me, And come, defy Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed? And how shall I defy, whom Yahweh has not defied?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I see him: look, it is a people who stays alone, And will not be reckoned among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let my last end be like his!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and, look, you have blessed them altogether.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Balak said to him, Come, I pray you, with me to another place, from where you may see them; you will see but the utmost part of them, and will not see them all: and curse them for me from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt-offering, while I meet [Yahweh] yonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Return to Balak, and thus you will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he came to him, and saw that he was standing by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has Yahweh spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; Listen to me, you son of Zippor:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God is not a man, that he should lie, Neither a son of man, that he should repent: Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Look, I have received [commandment] to bless: And he has blessed, and I can't reverse it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He has not seen iniquity in Jacob; Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel: Yahweh his God is with him, And the shout of a king is among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>God brings them forth out of Egypt; He has as it were the strength of the wild-ox.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Surely there is no magic against Jacob; Neither is there any fortune-telling against Israel: Now it will be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God wrought!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Look, a people rises up as a lioness, And as a lion does he lift himself up: He will not lie down until he eats of the prey, And drinks the blood of the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Didn't I tell you, saying, All that Yahweh speaks, that I must do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down on the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Balaam said to Balak, Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
