and you and your sons with you will bear the iniquity of your{+} priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, you bring near with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you will be before the tent of the testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they will keep your charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they will not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary and to the altar, that they will not die, neither they, nor you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they will be joined to you, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger will not come near to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you{+} will keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there will be no more wrath on the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I, look, I have taken your{+} brothers the Levites from among the sons of Israel: to you{+} they are a gift, given to Yahweh, to do the service of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you and your sons with you will keep your{+} priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that inside the veil; and you{+} will serve: I give you{+} the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger who comes near will be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Yahweh spoke to Aaron, And I, look, I have given you the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the sons of Israel; to you I have given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, as a portion forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This will be yours of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they will render to me, will be most holy for you and for your sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As the most holy things you will eat of it; every male will eat of it: it will be holy to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is yours: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, as a portion forever; everyone who is clean in your house will eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give to Yahweh, to you I have given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Yahweh, will be yours; everyone who is clean in your house will eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Everything devoted in Israel will be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they offer to Yahweh, both of man and beast will be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man you will surely redeem, and the firstborn of unclean beasts you will redeem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old you will redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you will not redeem; they are holy: you will sprinkle their blood on the altar, and will burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the flesh of them will be yours, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it will be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the sons of Israel offer to Yahweh, I have given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever: it is a covenant of salt forever before Yahweh to you and to your seed with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Yahweh said to Aaron, You will have no inheritance in their land, neither will you have any portion among them: I am your portion and your inheritance among the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And to the sons of Levi, look, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And from now on the sons of Israel will not come near the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the Levites will do the service of the tent of meeting, and they will bear their iniquity: it will be a statute forever throughout your{+} generations; and among the sons of Israel they will have no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For the tithe of the sons of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said to them, Among the sons of Israel they will have no inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover you will speak to the Levites, and say to them, When you{+} take of the sons of Israel the tithe which I have given you{+} from them for your{+} inheritance, then you{+} will offer up a heave-offering of it for Yahweh, a tithe of the tithe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And your{+} heave-offering will be reckoned to you{+}, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus you{+} also will offer a heave-offering to Yahweh of all your{+} tithes, which you{+} receive of the sons of Israel; and of it you{+} will give Yahweh's heave-offering to Aaron the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Out of all your{+} gifts you{+} will offer every heave-offering of Yahweh, of all its best, even its hallowed part out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore you will say to them, When you{+} heave its best from it, then it will be reckoned to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine press.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And you{+} will eat it in every place, you{+} and your{+} households: for it is your{+} reward in return for your{+} service in the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you{+} will bear no sin by reason of it, when you{+} have heaved from it the best of it: and you{+} will not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, that you{+} will not die.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
