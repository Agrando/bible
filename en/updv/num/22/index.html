And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the sons of Amav, to call him, saying, Look, there is a people come out from Egypt: see, they cover the face of the earth, and they dwell across from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Come now therefore, I pray you, curse this people for me; for they are too mighty for me: perhaps I will prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of fortune-telling in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you{+} word again, as Yahweh will speak to me: and the princes of Moab remained with Balaam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Look, a people has come out of Egypt, which covers the face of the earth: now, come curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight against them, and will drive them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said to Balaam, You will not go with them; you will not curse the people; for they are blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, You{+} get into your{+} land; for Yahweh refuses to give me leave to go with you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray you, hinder you from coming to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do: come therefore, I pray you, curse this people for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Balaam answered and said to the slaves of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, I pray you{+}, you{+} also tarry here this night, that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two attendants were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he struck her again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the angel of Yahweh went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me, If there were a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever in the habit to do so to you? And he said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the angel of Yahweh said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Look, I have come forth for an adversary, because your way is precipitous before me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times: unless she had turned aside from me, surely I would have even killed you by now, and saved her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, I have sinned; for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get myself back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, Go with the men; but only the word that I will speak to you, that you will speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when Balak heard that Balaam came, he went out to meet him to Ar of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Balak said to Balaam, Didn't I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn't you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Balaam said to Balak, Look, I have come to you: do I now have any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
