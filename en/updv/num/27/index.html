Give to us a possession among the brothers of our father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Moses brought their cause before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: you will surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers; and you will cause the inheritance of their father to pass to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you will speak to the sons of Israel, saying, If a man dies, and has no son, then you{+} will cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if he has no daughter, then you{+} will give his inheritance to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if he has no brothers, then you{+} will give his inheritance to his father's brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if his father has no brothers, then you{+} will give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he will possess it: and it will be to the sons of Israel a statute [and] ordinance, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Get up into this mountain of Abarim, and look at the land which I have given to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when you have seen it, you also will be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>because you{+} rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters before their eyes.
