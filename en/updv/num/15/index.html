and that soul will be cut off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because he has despised the word of Yahweh, and has broken his commandment, that soul will completely be cut off; his iniquity will be on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they put him in ward, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, The man will surely be put to death: all the congregation will stone him with stones outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the congregation brought him outside the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Speak to the sons of Israel, and bid them that they make themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and it will be to you{+} for a fringe, that you{+} may look at it, and remember all the commandments of Yahweh, and do them; and that you{+} don't follow after your{+} own heart and your{+} own eyes, which you{+} prostitute after;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>that you{+} may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy to your{+} God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I am Yahweh your{+} God, who brought you{+} out of the land of Egypt, to be your{+} God: I am Yahweh your{+} God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
