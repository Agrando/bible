And you{+} seek the priesthood also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Yahweh: and Aaron, what is he that you{+} murmur against him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but must you surely make yourself also a prince over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, Don't respect their offering: I haven't taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Moses said to Korah, You and all your company are to be before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and you{+} take every man his censer, and put incense on them, and you{+} bring before Yahweh every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on them, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the congregation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they fell on their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Speak to the congregation, saying, You{+} get up from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you{+}, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, or else you{+} will be consumed in all their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So they got up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Moses said, Hereby you{+} will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of my own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If these die the common death of all of man, or if they be visited after the visitation of all of man; then Yahweh has not sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if Yahweh makes a new thing, and the ground opens its mouth, and swallows them up, with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then you{+} will understand that these men have despised Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split apart that was under them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all of man who belonged to Korah, and all their goods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they, and all that belonged to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And all Israel who were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, If we don't, the earth will swallow us up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And fire came forth from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men who offered the incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he takes up the censers out of the burning, and you scatter the fire yonder; for they are holy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made into beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Yahweh; therefore they are holy; and they will be a sign to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>to be a memorial to the sons of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, comes near to burn incense before Yahweh; that he will not be as Korah, and as his company: as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You{+} have killed the people of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and saw that the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You{+} get up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell on their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Moses said to Aaron, Take your censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them: for wrath has gone out from Yahweh; the plague has begun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and saw that the plague had begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stopped.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
