This will be to them the suburbs of the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the cities which you{+} will give to the Levites, they will be the six cities of refuge, which you{+} will give for the manslayer to flee to: and besides them you{+} will give forty and two cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All the cities which you{+} will give to the Levites will be forty and eight cities; them [you{+} will give] with their suburbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And concerning the cities which you{+} will give of the possession of the sons of Israel, from the many you{+} will take many; and from the few you{+} will take few: every one according to his inheritance which he inherits will give of his cities to the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When you{+} pass over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then you{+} will appoint yourselves cities to be cities of refuge for you{+}, that the manslayer that kills any person unintentionally may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the cities will be to you{+} for refuge from the avenger, that the manslayer will not die, until he stands before the congregation for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the cities which you{+} will give will be for you{+} six cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You{+} will give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three cities you{+} will give in the land of Canaan; they will be cities of refuge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the sons of Israel, and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them, will these six cities be for refuge; that everyone who kills any person unintentionally may flee there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died, he is a murderer: the murderer will surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer will surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand, by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer: the murderer will surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The avenger of blood will himself put the murderer to death: when he meets him, he will put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if he thrusts him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait, so that he died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died; he who struck him will surely be put to death; he is a murderer: the avenger of blood will put the murderer to death, when he meets him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if he thrusts him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him anything without lying in wait,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him, and cast it on him, so that he died, and he wasn't his enemy, neither sought his harm;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then the congregation will judge between the striker and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the congregation will deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation will restore him to his city of refuge, where he has fled: and he will dwell in it until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if the manslayer will at any time go beyond the border of his city of refuge, where he flees,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of his city of refuge, and the avenger of blood slays the manslayer; he will not be guilty of blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the manslayer will return into the land of his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And these things will be for a statute [and] ordinance to you{+} throughout your{+} generations in all your{+} dwellings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Whoever kills any person, the murderer will be slain at the mouth of witnesses: but one witness will not testify against any person that he die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Moreover you{+} will take no ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death; but he will surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you{+} will take no ransom for someone to flee to his city of refuge, to come back to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So you{+} will not pollute the land in which you{+} are: for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him who shed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And you will not defile the land which you{+} inhabit, in the midst of which I stay: for I, Yahweh, stay in the midst of the sons of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
