that they do not defile their camp, where I stay in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the sons of Israel did so, and put them out outside the camp; as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so the sons of Israel did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Speak to the sons of Israel, When a man or woman will commit any sin that man commits, so as to trespass against Yahweh, and that soul will be guilty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>then he will confess his sin which he has done: and he will make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom he has been guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh will be the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement, by which atonement will be made for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And every heave-offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they present to the priest, will be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And every man's hallowed things will be his: whatever any man gives the priest, it will be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife goes aside, and commits a trespass against him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and a man has any sex with her, and it is hid from the eyes of her husband, and is kept close, and she is defiled, and there is no witness against her, and she is not taken in the act;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and the spirit of jealousy passed over him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she is defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy passed over him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she is not defiled:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>then the man will bring his wife to the priest, and will bring her oblation for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he will pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense on it; for it is a meal-offering of jealousy, a meal-offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the priest will bring her near, and set her before Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the priest will take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest will take, and put it into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the priest will set the woman before Yahweh, and let the hair of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal-offering of memorial in her hands, which is the meal-offering of jealousy: and the priest will have in his hand the water of bitterness that causes the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the priest will cause her to swear, and will say to the woman, If no man has lain with you, and if you have not gone aside to uncleanness, being under your husband, [then] be innocent from this water of bitterness that causes the curse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if you have gone aside, being under your husband, and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you besides your husband:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then the priest will cause the woman to swear with the oath of cursing, and the priest will say to the woman, Yahweh will make you a curse and an oath among your people, when Yahweh makes your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and this water that causes the curse will go into your insides, and make your body to swell, and your thigh to fall away. And the woman will say, Amen, Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the priest will write these curses in a book, and he will blot them out into the water of bitterness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he will make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes the curse; and the water that causes the curse will enter into her [and become] bitter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the priest will take the meal-offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and will wave the meal-offering before Yahweh, and bring it to the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the priest will take a handful of the meal-offering, as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, and afterward will make the woman drink the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he has made her drink the water, then it will come to pass, if she is defiled, and has committed a trespass against her husband, that the water that causes the curse will enter into her [and become] bitter, and her body will swell, and her thigh will fall away: and the woman will be a curse among her people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean; then she will be innocent, and will conceive seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband, goes aside, and is defiled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>or when the spirit of jealousy passes over a man, and he is jealous of his wife; then he will set the woman before Yahweh, and the priest will execute on her all this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the man will be innocent from iniquity, and that woman will bear her iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
