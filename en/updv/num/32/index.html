and your slaves have cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your slaves for a possession; don't bring us over the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Moses said to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, Will your{+} brothers go to the war, and will you{+} sit here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And why do you{+} discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from going over into the land which Yahweh has given them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus did your{+} fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the sons of Israel, that they should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Yahweh's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, will see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander to and fro in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of Yahweh, was consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And, look, you{+} have risen up in your{+} fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if you{+} turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you{+} will destroy all this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but we ourselves will go armed, hastily before the sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones will dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>We will not return to our houses, until the sons of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance has fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Moses said to them, If you{+} will do this thing, if you{+} will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and every armed man of you{+} will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you{+} will return, and be innocent toward Yahweh, and toward Israel; and this land will be to you{+} for a possession before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if you{+} will not do so, look, you{+} have sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your{+} sin will find you{+} out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Build yourselves cities for your{+} little ones, and folds for your{+} sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your{+} mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your slaves will do as my lord commands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, will be there in the cities of Gilead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but your slaves will pass over, every man who is armed for war, before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses said to them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will pass with you{+} over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land will be subdued before you{+}; then you{+} will give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but if they will not pass over with you{+} armed, they will have possessions among you{+} in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, As Yahweh has said to your slaves, so we will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance [will remain] with us beyond the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Moses gave to them, even to the sons of Gad, and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to its cities with [their] borders, even the cities of the land round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran: fortified cities, and folds for sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Sibmah: and they gave other names to the cities which they built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and the Amorites who were in it were dispossessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns, and called them Havvoth-jair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
