and you{+} will cut down the graven images of their gods; and you{+} will destroy their name out of that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You{+} will not do so to Yahweh your{+} God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to the place which Yahweh your{+} God will choose out of all your{+} tribes, to put his name there to stay, you{+} will seek, and there you will come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and there you{+} will bring your{+} burnt-offerings, and your{+} sacrifices, and your{+} tithes, and the heave-offering of your{+} hand, and your{+} vows, and your{+} freewill-offerings, and the firstborns of your{+} herd and of your{+} flock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and there you{+} will eat before Yahweh your{+} God, and you{+} will rejoice in all that you{+} put your{+} hand to, you{+} and your{+} households, in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You{+} will not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for you{+} have not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Yahweh your God gives you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when you{+} go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Yahweh your{+} God causes you{+} to inherit, and he gives you{+} rest from all your{+} enemies round about, so that you{+} dwell in safety;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>then it will come to pass that to the place which Yahweh your{+} God will choose to make his name stay there, there you{+} will bring all that I command you{+}: your{+} burnt-offerings, and your{+} sacrifices, your{+} tithes, and the heave-offering of your{+} hand, and all your{+} choice vows which you{+} vow to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you{+} will rejoice before Yahweh your{+} God, you{+}, and your{+} sons, and your{+} daughters, and your{+} male slaves, and your{+} female slaves, and the Levite who is inside your{+} gates, since he has no portion nor inheritance with you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You be careful not to offer your burnt-offerings in every place that you see;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but in the place which Yahweh will choose in one of your tribes, there you will offer your burnt-offerings, and there you will do all that I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh inside all your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle, and as of the hart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Only you{+} will not eat the blood; you will pour it out on the earth as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You may not eat inside your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborns of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill-offerings, nor the heave-offering of your hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but you will eat them before Yahweh your God in the place which Yahweh your God will choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your male slave, and your female slave, and the Levite who is inside your gates: and you will rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you put your hand to.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You be careful not to forsake the Levite as long as you live in your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When Yahweh your God will enlarge your border, as he has promised you, and you will say, I will eat flesh, because your soul desires to eat flesh;

and you will not eat the life with the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You will not eat it; you will pour it out on the earth as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You will not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with your sons after you, when you will do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you will take, and go to the place which Yahweh will choose:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and you will offer your burnt-offerings, the flesh and the blood, on the altar of Yahweh your God;

or else you will inquire after their gods, saying, How do these nations serve their gods? Even so I will do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You will not do so to Yahweh your God: for every disgusting thing to Yahweh, which he hates, they have done to their gods; for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Whatever thing I command you{+}, that you{+} will observe to do: you will not add thereto, nor diminish from it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
