Isn't he your father who has bought you? He has made you, and established you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember the days of old, Consider the years of many generations: Ask your father, and he will show you; Your elders, and they will tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, When he separated the sons of man, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For Yahweh's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He found him in a desert land, And in the waste howling wilderness; He surrounded him, he cared for him, He kept him as the apple of his eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As an eagle that stirs up her nest, That hovers over her young, He spread abroad his wings, he took them, He bore them on his pinions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yahweh alone led him, And there was no foreign god with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He made him ride on the high places of the earth, And he ate the increase of the field; And he made him to suck honey out of the rock, And oil out of the flinty rock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, With fat of lambs, And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, With the finest of the wheat; And of the blood of the grape you drank wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jacob ate and had his fill, Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: You have waxed fat, you have grown thick, you have become sleek; Then he forsook God who made him, And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]; With disgusting things they provoked him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They sacrificed to demons, [which were] not God, To gods that they did not know, To new [gods] that came up of late, Which your{+} fathers did not dread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of the Rock that begot you you are unmindful, And have forgotten God who gave you birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them] Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end will be: For they are a very perverse generation, Sons in whom is no faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; They have provoked me to anger with their vanities: And I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a fire is kindled in my anger, And burns to the lowest Sheol, And devours the earth with its increase, And sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will heap evils on them; I will spend my arrows on them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>[They will be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat And bitter destruction; And the teeth of beasts I will send on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Outside will the sword bereave, And in the chambers terror; [It will destroy] both young man and virgin, The suckling with the man of gray hairs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I said, I would scatter them far, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among common man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, Or else their adversaries should judge amiss, And they should say, Our hand is exalted, And Yahweh has not done all this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For they are a nation void of counsel, And there is no understanding in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, That they would consider their latter end!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How should one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Except their Rock had sold them, And Yahweh had delivered them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For their rock is not as our Rock, Even our enemies themselves being judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, And of the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Their wine is the poison of serpents, And the cruel venom of cobras.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Isn't this laid up in store with me, Sealed up among my treasures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For the day of vengeance and recompense will come in time. Their foot will slide, for the day of their calamity is near. And the things that are to come upon them will hurry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For Yahweh will judge his people, And repent himself for his slaves; When he sees that [their] power is gone, And there is none [remaining], shut up or left at large.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, [And] drank the wine of their drink-offering? Let them rise up and help you{+} Let them be your{+} protection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>See now that I, even I, am he, And there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>If I whet my glittering sword, And my hand takes hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my adversaries, And will recompense those who hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>I will make my arrows drunk with blood, And my sword will devour flesh; With the blood of the slain and the captives, From the longhaired heads of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Rejoice with him, [you{+}] heavens. And bow down before him, all [you{+}] gods. For he will avenge the blood of his sons, And will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will pay back those who hate him, And will make expiation for the land of his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them, Set your{+} heart to all the words which I testify to you{+} this day, which you{+} will command your{+} sons to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For it is no vain thing for you{+}; because it is your{+} life, and through this thing you{+} will prolong your{+} days in the land, where you{+} go over the Jordan to possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses that very same day, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is across from Jericho; and look at the land of Canaan, which I give to the sons of Israel for a possession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>because you{+} trespassed against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you{+} did not sanctify me in the midst of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For you will see the land before you; but you will not go there into the land which I give the sons of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
