Let him go and return to his house, or else if he dies in the battle, another will man dedicate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And what man is there that has planted a vineyard, and has not used its fruit? Let him go and return to his house, or else if he dies in the battle, another man will use its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And what man is there that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? Let him go and return to his house, or else if he dies in the battle, another man will take her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the officers will speak further to the people, and they will say, What man is there who is fearful and fainthearted?
