he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you: so you will drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Don't speak in your heart, after that Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh does drive them out from before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, don't you forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you{+} came to this place, you{+} have been rebellious against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Also in Horeb you{+} provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you{+} to destroy you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When I went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you{+}, then I remained in the mount forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you{+} in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Yahweh said to me, Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people that you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made themselves a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people, and, look, it is a stiff-necked people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I looked, and saw that you{+} had sinned against Yahweh your{+} God; you{+} had made yourselves a molten calf: you{+} had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your{+} eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water; because of all your{+} sin which you{+} sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which Yahweh was angry against you{+} to destroy you{+}. But Yahweh listened to me that time also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I took your{+} sin, the calf which you{+} had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mount.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, you{+} provoked Yahweh to wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Yahweh sent you{+} from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you{+}; then you{+} rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your{+} God, and you{+} didn't believe him, nor listen to his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You{+} have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that he knew you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I prayed to Yahweh, and said, O Sovereign Yahweh, don't destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Remember your slaves, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>or else the land from where you brought us out will say, Because Yahweh wasn't able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
