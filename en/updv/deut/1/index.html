you{+} will hear the small and the great alike; you{+} will not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you{+}, you{+} will bring to me, and I will hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I commanded you{+} at that time all the things which you{+} should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you{+} saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I said to you{+}, You{+} have come to the hill-country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Look, Yahweh your God has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you{+} came near to me every one of you{+}, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you{+}, one man for every tribe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yet you{+} would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your{+} God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and you{+} murmured in your{+} tents, and said, Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Where are we going up? Our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and more numerous than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then I said to you{+}, Don't dread, neither be afraid of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Yahweh your{+} God who goes before you{+}, he will fight for you{+}, according to all that he did for you{+} in Egypt before your{+} eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you{+} went, until you{+} came to this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet in this thing you{+} did not believe Yahweh your{+} God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who went before you{+} in the way, to seek you{+} out a place to pitch your{+} tents in, in fire by night, to show you{+} by what way you{+} should go, and in the cloud by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Yahweh heard the voice of your{+} words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Surely not a man of these men of this evil generation will see the good land, which I swore to give to your{+} fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he will see it; and to him I will give the land that he has trodden on, and to his sons, because he has wholly followed Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Also Yahweh was angry with me for your{+} sakes, saying, You also will not go in there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he will go in there: encourage him; for he will cause Israel to inherit it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Moreover your{+} little ones, that you{+} said should be a prey, and your{+} sons, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they will go in there, and to them I will give it, and they will possess it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But as for you{+}, you{+} turn, and take your{+} journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then you{+} answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us. And you{+} girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Yahweh said to me, Say to them, Don't go up, neither fight; for I am not among you{+}; lest you{+} be struck before your{+} enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So I spoke to you{+}, and you{+} didn't listen; but you{+} rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you{+}, and chased you{+}, as bees do, and beat you{+} down in Seir, even to Hormah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And you{+} returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen to your{+} voice, nor gave ear to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So you{+} remained in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you{+} remained [there].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
