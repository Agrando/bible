And the blood will be forgiven them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So you will put away the innocent blood from the midst of you, when you will do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry them away captive,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have a desire to her, and would take her to you as wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then you will bring her home to your house; and she will shave her head, and pare her nails;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and she will put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and will remain in your house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that you will go in to her, and be her husband, and she will be your wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it will be, if you have no delight in her, then you will let her go where she will; but you will not sell her at all for money, you will not deal with her as a slave, because you have humbled her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him sons, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then it will be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>but he will acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not listen to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>then his father and his mother will lay hold on him, and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate of his place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and they will say to the elders of his city, This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the men of his city will stone him to death with stones: so you will put away the evil from the midst of you; and all Israel will hear, and fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death, and you hang him on a tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>his body will not remain all night on the tree, but you will surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed of God; that you do not defile your land which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
