And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Yahweh said to Moses, Look, you will sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then my anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they will be devoured, and many evils and troubles will come upon them; so that they will say in that day, Haven't these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they will have wrought, in that they have turned to other gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore you{+} write this song for yourselves, and you teach it to the sons of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For when I will have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they will have eaten and filled themselves, and waxed fat; then they will turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it will come to pass, when many evils and troubles come upon them, that this song will testify before them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he [Yahweh] gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of good courage; for you will bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that Moses commanded the Levites, that bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your{+} God, that it may be there for a witness against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: look, while I am yet alive with you{+} this day, you{+} have been rebellious against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Assemble to me all the elders of your{+} tribes, and your{+} officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know that after my death you{+} will completely corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you{+}; and evil will befall you{+} in the latter days; because you{+} will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger through the work of your{+} hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
