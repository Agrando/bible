or if the latter husband dies, who took her to be his wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she's defiled; for that is disgusting before Yahweh: and you will not cause the land to sin, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When a man takes a new wife, he will not go out in the host, neither will he be charged with any business: he will be free at home one year, and will cheer his wife whom he has taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>No man will take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge; for he takes [a man's] life to pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If a man is found stealing any of his brothers of the sons of Israel, and he deals with him as a slave, or sells him; then that thief will die: so you will put away the evil from the midst of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites will teach you{+}: as I commanded them, so you{+} will observe to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you{+} came forth out of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When you lend your fellow man any manner of loan, you will not go into his house to fetch his pledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You will stand outside, and the man to whom you lend will bring forth the pledge outside to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if he is a poor man, you will not sleep with his pledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>you will surely restore to him the pledge when the sun goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you: and it will be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You will not oppress a hired worker who is poor and needy, whether he is of your brothers, or of your sojourners who are in your land inside your gates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>in his day you will give him his wages, neither will the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it: lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it is sin to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The fathers will not be put to death for the sons, neither will the sons be put to death for the fathers: every man will be put to death for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You will not wrest the justice [due] to the fatherless sojourner, nor take the widow's raiment to pledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>but you will remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you from there: therefore I command you to do this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot a sheaf in the field, you will not go again to fetch it: it will be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When you beat your olive-tree, you will not go over the boughs again: it will be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When you gather [the grapes of] your vineyard, you will not glean it after you: it will be for the sojourner, for the fatherless, and for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you will remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt: therefore I command you to do this thing.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
