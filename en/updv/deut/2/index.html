And we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Yahweh said to me, Don't vex Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>(The Emim dwelt in it previously, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Horites also dwelt in Seir previously, but the sons of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now rise up, and get yourselves over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the days in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we had come over the brook Zered, were thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and when you come near across from the sons of Ammon, don't vex them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the sons of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim dwelt in it previously; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>as he did for the sons of Esau, that dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even to this day:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You{+} rise up, take your{+} journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: see, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This day I will begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who will hear the report of you, and will tremble, and be in anguish because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You will sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>as the sons of Esau that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites that dwell in Ar, did to me; until I will pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as at this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Yahweh said to me, Look, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And we took all his cities at that time, and completely destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>only the cattle we took for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and [from] the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill-country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
