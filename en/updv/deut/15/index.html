And also to your female slave you will do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It will not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you; for to the double of the wages of a hired worker he has served you six years: and Yahweh your God will bless you in all that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock you will sanctify to Yahweh your God: you will do no work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You will eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place which Yahweh will choose, you and your household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if it has any blemish, [as if it is] lame or blind, any ill blemish whatever, you will not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You will eat it inside your gates: the unclean and the clean [will eat it] alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Only you will not eat its blood; you will pour it out on the ground as water.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
