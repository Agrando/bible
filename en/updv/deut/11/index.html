how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you{+}, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and what he did to you{+} in the wilderness, until you{+} came to this place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but your{+} eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore you{+} will keep all [of] the commandment which I command you this day, that you{+} may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you{+} go over to possess it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and that you{+} may prolong your{+} days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your{+} fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the land, where you go in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from where you{+} came out, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>but the land, where you{+} go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, [and] drinks water of the rain of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>a land which Yahweh your God cares for: the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it will come to pass, if you{+} will listen diligently to my commandments which I command you{+} this day, to love Yahweh your{+} God, and to serve him with all your{+} heart and with all your{+} soul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that I will give the rain of your{+} land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will give grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Take heed to yourselves, or else your{+} heart will be deceived, and you{+} will turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and then the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you{+}, and then he will shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will not yield its fruit; and then you{+} will quickly perish from off the good land which Yahweh gives you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore you{+} will lay up these words of mine in your{+} heart and in your{+} soul; and you{+} will bind them for a sign on your{+} hand, and they will be for frontlets between your{+} eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you{+} will teach them to your{+} sons, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you will write them on the door-posts of your house, and on your gates;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that your{+} days may be multiplied, and the days of your{+} sons, in the land which Yahweh swore to your{+} fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For if you{+} will diligently keep all this commandment which I command you{+}, to do it, to love Yahweh your{+} God, to walk in all his ways, and to stick to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you{+}, and you{+} will dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Every place on which the sole of your{+} foot will tread will be yours{+} from the wilderness.
