Yet you{+} say, In what have you loved us? Wasn't Esau Jacob's brother, says Yahweh: yet I loved Jacob;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and [gave] his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Whereas Edom says, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; this is what Yahweh of Hosts says, They will build, but I will throw down; and men will call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Yahweh has indignation forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And your{+} eyes will see, and you{+} will say, May Yahweh be magnified beyond the border of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A son honors his father, and a slave his master: if then I am a father, where is my honor? And if I am a master, where is my fear? says Yahweh of hosts to you{+}, O priests, that despise my name. And you{+} say, In what have we despised your name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You{+} offer polluted bread on my altar. And you{+} say, In what have we polluted you? In that you{+} say, The table of Yahweh is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when you{+} offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! And when you{+} offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you? Or will he accept your person? says Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now, I pray you{+}, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us: this has been by your{+} means: will he accept any of your{+} persons? says Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Oh that there were one among you{+} who would shut the doors, that you{+} might not kindle [fire on] my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you{+}, says Yahweh of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your{+} hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For from the rising of the sun even to the going down of the same my name [will be] great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense [will be] offered to my name, and a pure offering: for my name [will be] great among the Gentiles, says Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But you{+} profane it, in that you{+} say, The table of Yahweh is polluted, and its fruit, even its food, is contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You{+} also say, Look, what a weariness it is! And you{+} have snuffed at it, says Yahweh of hosts; and you{+} have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus you{+} bring the offering: should I accept this at your{+} hand? says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male, and vows, and sacrifices to the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, says Yahweh of hosts, and my name is awesome among the Gentiles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
