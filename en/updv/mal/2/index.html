Has not one God created us? Why do we betray every man against his brother, profaning the covenant of our fathers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Judah has betrayed, and a disgusting thing is done in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of Yahweh which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yahweh will cut off, to the man who does this, him who wakes and him who answers, out of the tents of Jacob, and him who offers an offering to Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And this again you{+} do: you{+} cover the altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping, and with sighing, insomuch that he does not regard the offering anymore, neither receives it with good will at your{+} hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet you{+} say, Why? Because Yahweh has been witness between you and the wife of your youth, whom you have betrayed, though she is your partner, and the wife of your covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And no one who does this has part of the Spirit remaining in him; neither is such a one seeking a godly seed. Therefore take heed{+} to your{+} spirit; and do not betray the wife of your youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he who hates, divorces, says Yahweh, the God of Israel, and he will cover his garment with violence, says Yahweh of hosts. Therefore take heed to your{+} spirit, that you{+} do not betray [the wife of your youth].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You{+} have wearied Yahweh with your{+} words. Yet you{+} say, In what have we wearied him? In that you{+} say, Everyone who does evil is good in the eyes of Yahweh, and he delights in them; or where is the God of justice?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
