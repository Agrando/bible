A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Hear this, all you{+} peoples; Give ear, all you{+} inhabitants of this world,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Both sons of man and sons of a man Together, rich and poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My mouth will speak wisdom; And the meditation of my heart will be of understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will incline my ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying on the harp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why should I fear in the days of evil, When iniquity at my heels circles me about?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Those who trust in their wealth, And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>None [of them] can by any means redeem his brother, Nor give to God a ransom for him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(For the redemption of their life is costly, And it fails forever;)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That he should still live always, That he should not see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he will see it. Wise men die; The fool and the brutish alike perish, And leave their wealth to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Their graves are their houses forever, [And] their dwelling-places to all generations; [Even though] they call lands after their own names.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But man [being] in honor does not reside: He is like the beasts that perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This way of theirs is their folly: Yet after them men approve their sayings. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They are appointed as a flock for Sheol; Death will be their shepherd; And the upright will have dominion over them in the morning; And their beauty will be for Sheol to consume, Far away from their lofty home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol; For he will receive me. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Don't be afraid when one is made rich, When the glory of his house is increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For when he dies he will carry nothing away; His glory will not descend after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Though while he lived he blessed his soul (And men praise you, when you do well to yourself,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will go to the generation of his fathers; They will never see the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Man who is in honor, and does not understand, Is like the beasts that perish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
