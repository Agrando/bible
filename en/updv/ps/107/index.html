O give thanks to Yahweh; For he is good; For his loving-kindness [endures] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let the redeemed of Yahweh say [so] Whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And gathered out of the lands, From the east and from the west, From the north and from the west.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Hungry and thirsty, Their soul fainted in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, And he delivered them out of their distresses,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He led them also by a straight way, That they might go to a city of habitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Oh that men would praise Yahweh for his loving-kindness, And for his wonderful works to the sons of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he satisfies the longing soul, And the hungry soul he fills with good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, Being bound in affliction and iron,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because they rebelled against the words of God, And despised the counsel of the Most High:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore he brought down their heart with labor; They fell down, and there was none to help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, And he saved them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, And broke their bonds in sunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Oh that men would praise Yahweh for his loving-kindness, And for his wonderful works to the sons of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For he has broken the gates of bronze, And cut the bars of iron in sunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Fools because of their transgression, And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Their soul is disgusted by all manner of food; And they draw near to the gates of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, And he saves them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He sends his word, and heals them, And delivers [them] from their destructions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Oh that men would praise Yahweh for his loving-kindness, And for his wonderful works to the sons of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, And declare his works with singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Those who go down to the sea in ships, That do business in great waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>These see the works of Yahweh, And his wonders in the deep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, Which lifts up its waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths: Their soul melts away because of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunk man, And are at their wits' end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, And he brings them out of their distresses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He makes the storm be calm, So that its waves are still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they are glad because they are quiet; So he brings them to their desired haven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Oh that men would praise Yahweh for his loving-kindness, And for his wonderful works to the sons of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people, And praise him in the seat of the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He turns rivers into a wilderness, And watersprings into a thirsty ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A fruitful land into a salt desert, For the wickedness of those who dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He turns a wilderness into a pool of water, And a dry land into watersprings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And there he makes the hungry to dwell, That they may prepare a city of habitation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And get fruits of increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; And he does not allow their cattle to decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Again, they are diminished and bowed down Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He pours contempt on princes, And causes them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Yet he sets the needy on high from affliction, And makes [him] families like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The upright will see it, and be glad; And all iniquity will stop her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Whoever is wise will give heed to these things; And they will consider the loving-kindnesses of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
