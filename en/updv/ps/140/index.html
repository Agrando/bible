A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Yahweh, from [the] evil man; Preserve me from the violent man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who devise mischiefs in their heart; Continually they gather themselves together for war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; Adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Keep me, O Yahweh, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from the violent man: Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set traps for me. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I said to Yahweh, You are my God: Give ear to the voice of my supplications, O Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O Yahweh the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Don't grant, O Yahweh, the desires of the wicked; Don't further his evil plot. They will exalt themselves. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As for the head of those who speak lies about me Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let burning coals fall on them: Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, from where they will not rise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>An evil speaker will not be established in the earth: Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted, And justice for the needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name: The upright will dwell in your presence.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
