A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for Yahweh; And he inclined to me, and heard my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay; And he set my feet on a rock, and established my goings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he has put a new song in my mouth, even praise to our God: Many will see it, and fear, And will trust in Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed is the [noble] man who makes Yahweh his trust, And does not respect the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Many, O Yahweh my God, are the wonderful works which you have done, And your thoughts which are toward us; They can't be set in order to you; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Sacrifice and offering you have no delight in; My ears you have opened: Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have not required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said, Look, I have come; In the roll of the book it is written of me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I delight to do your will, O my God; Yes, your law is inside me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I have proclaimed the good news of righteousness in the great assembly; Look, I will not refrain my lips, O Yahweh, you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have not hid your righteousness inside my heart; I have declared your faithfulness and your salvation; I have not concealed your loving-kindness and your truth from the great assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Don't withhold your tender mercies from me, O Yahweh; Let your loving-kindness and your truth continually preserve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For innumerable evils have surrounded me; My iniquities have overtaken me, so that I am not able to look up; They are more than the hairs of my head; And my heart has failed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be pleased, O Yahweh, to deliver me: Hurry to help me, O Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them be put to shame and confounded together That seek after my soul to destroy it: Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor That delight in my hurt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Let them be desolate by reason of their shame That say to me, Aha, aha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you: Let such as love your salvation say continually, Yahweh be magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But I am poor and needy; [Yet] the Lord thinks on me: You are my help and my deliverer; Make no tarrying, O my God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
