Don't fret yourself because of evildoers, Neither be envious against those who work unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For they will soon be cut down like the grass, And wither as the green herb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Trust in Yahweh, and do good; Stay in the land, and pasture on faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Delight yourself also in Yahweh; And he will give you the desires of your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Commit your way to Yahweh; Trust also in him, and he will bring it to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he will make your righteousness to go forth as the light, And your justice as the noonday.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Rest in Yahweh, and wait patiently for him: Don't fret yourself because of him who prospers in his way, Because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: Don't fret yourself, [it tends] only to evildoing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For evildoers will be cut off; But those who wait for Yahweh, they will inherit the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For yet a little while, and the wicked will not be: Yes, you will diligently consider his place, and he will not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the meek will inherit the land, And will delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The wicked plots against the just, And gnashes on him with his teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Lord will laugh at him; For he sees that his day is coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, To cast down the poor and needy, To slay such as are upright in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their sword will enter into their own heart, And their bows will be broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is a little that the righteous has Than the abundance of many wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the arms of the wicked will be broken; But Yahweh upholds the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yahweh knows the days of the perfect; And their inheritance will be forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They will not be put to shame in the time of evil; And in the days of famine they will be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the wicked will perish, And the enemies of Yahweh will be as the fat of lambs: They will consume; in smoke they will consume away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The wicked borrows, and does not pay again; But the righteous deals graciously, and gives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For such as are blessed of him will inherit the land; And those who are cursed of him will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A [noble] man's goings are established of Yahweh; And he delights in his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Though he falls, he will not be completely cast down; For Yahweh upholds him with his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have been young, and now am old; Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, Nor his seed begging bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>All the day long he deals graciously, and lends; And his seed is blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Depart from evil, and do good; And stay forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For Yahweh loves justice, And does not forsake his saints; They are preserved forever: But the seed of the wicked will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The righteous will inherit the land, And stay in it forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom, And his tongue speaks justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The law of his God is in his heart; None of his steps will slide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The wicked watches the righteous, And seeks to slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Yahweh will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Wait for Yahweh, and keep his way, And he will exalt you to inherit the land: When the wicked are cut off, you will see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have seen the wicked in great power, And spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But one passed by, and, look, he was not: Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Mark the perfect man, and look at the upright; For there is a [happy] end to the man of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As for transgressors, they will be destroyed together; The end of the wicked will be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the salvation of the righteous is of Yahweh; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Yahweh helps them, and rescues them; He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them, Because they have taken refuge in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
