Oh give thanks to Yahweh; for he is good; For his loving-kindness [endures] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, Or show forth all his praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Blessed are those who keep justice, And he who does righteousness at all times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Remember me, O Yahweh, with the favor that you bear to your people; Oh visit me with your salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>That I may see the prosperity of your chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of your nation, That I may glory with your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Our fathers did not understand your wonders in Egypt; They did not remember the multitude of your loving-kindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he saved them from the hand of him who hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they believed his words; They sang his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They soon forgot his works; They did not wait for his counsel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tried God in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They envied Moses also in the camp, [And] Aaron the saint of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They made a calf in Horeb, And worshiped a molten image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus they exchanged their glory For the likeness of an ox that eats grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They forgot God their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wondrous works in the land of Ham, [And] awesome works by the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, they despised the pleasant land, They did not believe his word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But murmured in their tents, And did not listen to the voice of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore he swore to them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And that he would cast down their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They joined themselves also to Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague broke in on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And that was reckoned to him for righteousness, To all generations forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They did not destroy the peoples, As Yahweh commanded them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And served their idols, Which became a snare to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Thus they were defiled with their works, And prostituted in their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Therefore the wrath of Yahweh was kindled against his people, And he was disgusted with his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And those who hated them ruled over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Many times he delivered them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>He made them also to be pitied Of all those who carried them captive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Save us, O Yahweh our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks to your holy name, And to triumph in your praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And let all the people say, Amen, Hallelujah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
