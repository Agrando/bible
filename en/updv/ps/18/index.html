[A Psalm] of David the slave of Yahweh, who spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul, and he said: I love you, O Yahweh, my strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Yahweh is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge; My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: So I will be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The cords of death surrounded me, And the floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In my distress I called on Yahweh, And cried to my God: He heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry before him came into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then the earth shook and trembled; The foundations also of the mountains quaked And were shaken, because he was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he rode on a cherub, and flew; Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, Darkness of water, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed, Hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yahweh also thundered in the heavens, And the Most High uttered his voice, Hailstones and coals of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; Yes, lightnings manifold, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the channels of water appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At your rebuke, O Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of your nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, And from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Yahweh was my support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands he has recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, And have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For all his ordinances were before me, And I do not put away his statutes from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I was also perfect with him, And I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore Yahweh has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to the cleanness of my hands in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; With the perfect [noble] man you will show yourself perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the pure you will show yourself pure; And with the perverse you will show yourself froward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For you will save the afflicted people; But the haughty eyes you will bring down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For you will light my lamp: Yahweh my God will lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For by you I run on a troop; And by my God I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Yahweh is tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For who is God, but Yahweh?
