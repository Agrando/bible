[A Psalm] of David. Save me, O God; For the waters have come in to my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried: My eyes fail while I wait for my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head: Those who would cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty: That which I did not take away I have to restore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>O God, you know my foolishness; And my sins are not hid from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Don't let those who wait for you be put to shame through me, O Sovereign Yahweh of hosts: Don't let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, O God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Because for your sake I have borne reproach; Shame has covered my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I have become a stranger to my brothers, And an alien to my mother's sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the zeal of your house has eaten me up; And the reproaches of those who reproach you have fallen on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When I wept, [and chastened] my soul with fasting, That was to my reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Those who sit in the gate talk of me; And [I am] the song of the drunkards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Yahweh, in an acceptable time: O God, in the abundance of your loving-kindness, Answer me in the truth of your salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Deliver me out of the mire, and don't let me sink: Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Don't let the floodwater overwhelm me, Neither let the deep swallow me up; And don't let the pit shut its mouth on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Answer me, O Yahweh; for your loving-kindness is good: According to the multitude of your tender mercies turn to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And don't hide your face from your slave; For I am in distress; answer me speedily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Draw near to my soul, and redeem it: Ransom me because of my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor: My adversaries are all before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Reproach has broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; And for comforters, but I found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They gave me also gall for my food; And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let their table before them become a snare; And for the secure ones, [let it become] a trap.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can't see; And make their loins continually to shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Pour out your indignation on them, And let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let their habitation be desolate; Let none dwell in their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they persecute him whom you have struck; And they tell of the sorrow of those whom you have wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Add iniquity to their iniquity; And don't let them come into your righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let them be blotted out of the Book of Life, And not be written with the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I am poor and sorrowful: Let your salvation, O God, set me up on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will praise the name of God with a song, And will magnify him with thanksgiving.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it will please Yahweh better than an ox, [Or] a bull that has horns and hoofs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The meek have seen it, and are glad: You{+} who seek after God, let your{+} heart live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For Yahweh hears the needy, And does not despise his prisoners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let heaven and earth praise him, The seas, and everything that moves in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; And they will remain there, and have it in possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The seed also of his slaves will inherit it; And those who love his name will stay there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
