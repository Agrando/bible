A Psalm of Asaph. I will cry to God with my voice, Even to God with my voice; and he will give ear to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand during the night [was] before him, and did not slack; My soul refused to be comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You hold my eyes watching: I am so troubled that I can't speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I call to remembrance my song in the night: I sing with my own heart; And my spirit makes diligent search.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will the Lord cast off forever?
