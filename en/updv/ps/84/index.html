A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How amiable are your tabernacles, O Yahweh of hosts!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>My soul longs, yes, even faints for the courts of Yahweh; My heart and my flesh cry out to the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Yes, the sparrow has found her a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, Even your altars, O Yahweh of hosts, My King, and my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Blessed are those who dwell in your house: They will still be praising you.
