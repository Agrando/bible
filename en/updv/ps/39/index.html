A Psalm of David. I said, I will take heed to my ways, That I don't sin with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, While the wicked is before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I was mute with silence, I held my peace, even from good; And my sorrow was stirred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>My heart was hot inside me; While I was musing the fire burned: [Then] I spoke with my tongue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yahweh, make me to know my end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Look, you have made my days [as] handbreadths; And my lifetime is as nothing before you: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Surely everyone among man walks in a vain show; Surely they are disquieted in vain: He heaps up [riches], and does not know who will gather them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Deliver me from all my transgressions: Don't make me the reproach of the foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I was mute, I did not open my mouth; Because you did it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Remove your stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When you with rebukes correct man for iniquity, You make his beauty to consume away like a moth: Surely everyone among man is vanity. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Hear my prayer, O Yahweh, and give ear to my cry; Don't hold your peace at my tears: For I am a stranger with you, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Oh spare me, that I may recover strength, Before I go from here, and be no more.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
