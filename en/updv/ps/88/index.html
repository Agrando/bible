Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite. O Yahweh, the God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Let my prayer enter into your presence; Incline your ear to my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For my soul is full of troubles, And my life draws near to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I am reckoned with those who go down into the pit; I am as an [able-bodied] man without strength,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Cast off among the dead, Like the slain that lie in the grave, Whom you remember no more, And they are cut off from your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have laid me in the lowest pit, In dark places, in the deeps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your wrath lies hard on me, And you have afflicted me with all your waves.

Will the spirits of the dead arise and praise you? Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Will your loving-kindness be declared in the grave? Or your faithfulness in Destruction?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Will your wonders be known in the dark? And your righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But to you, O Yahweh, I have cried; And in the morning my prayer will come before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yahweh, why do you cast off my soul?
