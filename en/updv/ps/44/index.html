[A Psalm] of the sons of Korah. Maschil. We have heard with our ears, O God, Our fathers have told us, What work you did in their days, In the days of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You drove out the nations with your hand; But you planted them: You afflicted the peoples; But you spread them abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For they did not get the land in possession by their own sword, Neither did their own arm save them; But your right hand, and your arm, and the light of your countenance, Because you were favorable to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are my King, O God: Command deliverance for Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Through you we will push down our adversaries: Through your name we will tread them under that rise up against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I will not trust in my bow, Neither will my sword save me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But you have saved us from our adversaries, And have put them to shame that hate us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In God we have made our boast all the day long, And we will give thanks to your name forever. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But now you have cast [us] off, and brought us to dishonor, And don't go forth with our hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You make us to turn back from the adversary; And those who hate us take spoil for themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You have made us like sheep [appointed] for food, And have scattered us among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You sell your people for nothing, And have not increased [your wealth] by their price.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You make us a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and a derision to those who are round about us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You make us a byword among the nations, A shaking of the head among the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All the day long is my dishonor before me, And the shame of my face has covered me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the voice of him who reproaches and blasphemes, By reason of the enemy and the avenger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All this has come upon us; Yet we have not forgotten you, Neither have we dealt falsely in your covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Our heart is not turned back, Neither have our steps declined from your way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>That you have intensely broken us in the place of jackals, And covered us with the shadow of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If we have forgotten the name of our God, Or spread forth our hands to a strange god;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Will not God search this out?

Arise, don't cast [us] off forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Why do you hide your face, And forget our affliction and our oppression?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For our soul is bowed down to the dust: Our body sticks to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Rise up for our help, And redeem us for your loving-kindness' sake.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
