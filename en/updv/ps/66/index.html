Make a joyful noise to God, all the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Sing forth the glory of his name: Make his praise glorious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Say to God, How awesome are your works! Through the greatness of your power will your enemies submit themselves to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>All the earth will worship you, And will sing to you; They will sing to your name. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Come, and see the works of God; [He is] awesome in his doing toward the sons of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot: There we rejoiced in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He rules by his might forever; His eyes observe the nations: Don't let the rebellious exalt themselves.
