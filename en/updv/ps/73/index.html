A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel, [Even] to such as are pure in heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But as for me, my feet were almost gone; My steps had well near slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For I was envious at the arrogant, When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For there are no pangs in their death; But their strength is firm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They are not in trouble as common man; Neither are they plagued like man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck; Violence covers them as a garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their eyes stand out with fatness: They have more than heart could wish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression: They speak loftily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They have set their mouth in the heavens, And their tongue walks through the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore his people return here: And waters of a full [cup] are drained by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they say, How does God know? And is there knowledge in the Most High?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Look, these are the wicked; And, being always at ease, they increase in riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, And washed my hands in innocence;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all the day long I have been plagued, And chastened every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If I had said, I will speak thus; Look, I would have betrayed the generation of your sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I thought how I might know this, It was too painful for me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Until I went into the sanctuary of God, And considered their latter end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Surely you set them in slippery places: You cast them down to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How they have become a desolation in a moment! They are completely consumed with terrors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As a dream when one awakes, So, O Lord, when you awake, you will despise their image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For my soul was grieved, And I was pricked in my heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So brutish was I, and ignorant; I was [as] a beast before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nevertheless I am continually with you: You have held my right hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You will guide me with your counsel, And afterward receive me to glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Whom have I in heaven [but you] And there is none on earth that I desire besides you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>My flesh and my heart fails; [But] God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For, look, those who are far from you will perish: You have destroyed all those prostituting from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have made the Sovereign Yahweh my refuge, That I may tell of all your works.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
