And the sons of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness brought to pass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about me by night; they wanted to kill me, and they raped my concubine to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel; for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Look, you{+} sons of Israel, all of you{+}, give here your{+} advice and counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: [we will go up] against it by lot!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victuals for the people, that they may do, when they come to Geba of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, joined together as one man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that has come to pass among you{+}?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the sons of Benjamin were numbered on that day out of the cities twenty and six thousand swordsmen, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Among all this people there were seven hundred left-handed chosen men; every one could sling stones at a hair-width, and not miss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand swordsmen: all these were men of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Israel arose, and went up to Beth-el, and asked counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first to battle against the sons of Benjamin? And Yahweh said, Judah [will go up] first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the sons of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel set the battle in array against them at Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day twenty and two thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves, and set the battle again in array in the place where they set themselves in array the first day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the sons of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until evening; and they asked of Yahweh, saying, Shall I again draw near to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother? And Yahweh said, Go up against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the sons of Israel came near against the sons of Benjamin the second day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the sons of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then all the sons of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to Beth-el, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh, and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the sons of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And Yahweh said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Israel set ambushers against Gibeah round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goes up to Beth-el, and the other to Gibeah, in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the sons of Benjamin said, They are being struck down before us, as at the first. But the sons of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the ambushers of Israel broke forth out of their place, even out from the clearing of Geba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And there came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was intense; but they didn't know that evil was close on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the sons of Israel destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty and five thousand and a hundred men: all these [were] swordsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were struck; for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they trusted to the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge of the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers was, that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons; for they said, Surely they are struck down before us, as in the first battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and saw that the whole city went up [in smoke] to heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed; for they saw that evil came upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel to the way of the wilderness; but the battle stuck [close] to them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed them in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>They enclosed the Benjamites round about, chased them, [and from their] resting-place they trod them down, near Gibeah toward the sunrising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were] men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men, and stuck [closely] after them to Gidom, and struck of them two thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand swordsmen; all these [were] men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and remained in the rock of Rimmon four months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the men of Israel turned again on the sons of Benjamin, and struck them with the edge of the sword in the town: men to cattle, to all they found. Moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
