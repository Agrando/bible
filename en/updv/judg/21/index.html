For they had made a great oath concerning him who did not come up to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, He will surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the sons of Israel repented for Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them our daughters as wives?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that didn't come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?
