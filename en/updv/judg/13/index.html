And he said, I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Manoah said, Now let your words come to pass: what will be the ordering of the lad, and [how] shall we do to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, I pray you, let us detain you, that we may make ready a young goat for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Though you detain me, I will not eat of your bread; and if you will make ready a burnt-offering, you must offer it to Yahweh. For Manoah didn't know that he was the angel of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, What is your name, that, when your words come to pass, we may honor you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the angel of Yahweh said to him, Why do you ask after my name, seeing it is wonderful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Manoah took the young goat with the meal-offering, and offered it on the rock to Yahweh: and [the angel] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Yahweh ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the angel of Yahweh did not appear anymore to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Manoah said to his wife, We will surely die, because we have seen God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But his wife said to him, If Yahweh desired to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman bore a son, and named him Samson: and the lad grew, and Yahweh blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Spirit of Yahweh began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
