Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Awake, awake, Deborah; Awake, awake, utter a song: Arise, Barak, and capture your captives, you son of Abinoam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the survivor went down to the nobles, the people of Yahweh went down for me as warriors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Out of Ephraim their root [is] in Amalek; After you, Benjamin among your peoples; Out of Machir came down governors, And out of Zebulun those who handle the marshal's staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the princes in Issachar were with Deborah; As was Issachar, so was Barak; Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet. By the watercourses of Reuben There were great resolves of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the pipings for the flocks? At the watercourses of Reuben There were great searchings of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan: And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, And stayed by his creeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Zebulun was a people who jeopardized their lives to the death, And Naphtali, on the high places of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The kings came and fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan. In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: They took no gain of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From heaven fought the stars, From their courses they fought against Sisera.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The river Kishon swept them away, That ancient river, the river Kishon. O my soul, march on with strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the horsehoofs stamped By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Curse{+} Meroz, said the angel of Yahweh. Curse{+} bitterly its inhabitants, Because they didn't come to the help of Yahweh, To the help of Yahweh against the mighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Blessed above women will Jael be, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed she will be above women in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He asked water, [and] she gave him milk; She brought him butter in a lordly dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>She put her hand to the tent-pin, And her right hand to the workmen's hammer; And with the hammer she struck Sisera, she struck through his head; Yes, she pierced and struck through his temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay; At her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Through the window she looked forth, and cried, The mother of Sisera [cried] through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots tarry?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil? A womb, [even] two wombs for each chief [able-bodied] man. A spoil of dyed garments for Sisera. A spoil of embroidered dyed garments, [even] double embroidered dyed garments for the neck of the queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So let all your enemies perish, O Yahweh: But let those who love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
