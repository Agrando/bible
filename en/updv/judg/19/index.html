And where do you come from?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to him, We are passing from Beth-lehem-judah to the farther side of the hill-country of Ephraim; I am from there, and I went to Beth-lehem-judah: and I am going to the house of Yahweh; and there is no man who takes me into his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet there is both straw and fodder for our donkeys; and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your female slave, and for the attendant who is with your slaves: there is no want of anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the old man said, Peace be to you; however let all your wants lie on me; only don't lodge in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As they were making their hearts merry, look, the men of the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about, beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man who came into your house, that we may have sex with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said to them, No, my brothers, I pray you{+}, don't do so wickedly; seeing that this man has come into my house, don't do this folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Look, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine; I will bring them out now, and humble{+} them, and do with them what seems good to you{+}: but to this man don't do any such folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the men would not listen to him: so the man laid hold on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they had sex with her, and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to spring, they let her go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the woman came in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man's house where her lord was, until it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went out to go his way; and saw that the woman his concubine had fallen down at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to her, Rise up, and let us be going; but there was no answer: then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up, and went to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he came into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it was so, that all who saw [it] said, [Such a thing] has not happened nor been seen like that from the day the sons of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt to this day. And he commanded the men he sent saying, This is what you will say to every man of Israel, Has such [a thing] ever happened from the day the sons of Israel came up from Egypt until this day? Consider it, take counsel, and speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
