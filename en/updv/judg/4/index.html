And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh; and there went up ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the sons of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to mount Tabor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Deborah said to Barak, Rise up; for this is the day in which Yahweh has delivered Sisera into your hand; has not Yahweh gone out before you? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Yahweh discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera dismounted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; don't be afraid. And he turned in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water to drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it will be, when any man comes and inquires of you, and says, Is there any man here? Then you will say, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground; for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, look, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek. And he came to her; and saw that Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the hand of the sons of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
