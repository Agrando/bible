Because I do not love you{+}? God knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I do, I will continue to do, that I may cut off occasion from those who desire an occasion; that in what they glory, they may be found even as we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder; for even Satan fashions himself into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It is no great thing therefore if his servants also fashion themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I say again, let no man think me foolish; but if [you{+} do], yet receive me as foolish, that I also may glory a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That which I speak, I don't speak after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For you{+} bear with the foolish gladly, being wise [yourselves].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you{+} bear with a man, if he brings you{+} into slavery, if he devours you{+}, if he takes you{+} [captive], if he exalts himself, if he strikes you{+} on the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I speak by way of shame, as though we had been weak. Yet in what any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they servants of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths often.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Of the Jews five times I received forty [stripes] less one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[in] journeyings often, [in] perils of rivers, [in] perils of robbers, [in] perils from [my] countrymen, [in] perils from the Gentiles, [in] perils in the city, [in] perils in the wilderness, [in] perils in the sea, [in] perils among false brothers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>[in] labor and travail, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fasts often, in cold and nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Besides those things that are outside, there is that which presses on me daily, anxiety for all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn [with distress]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must surely glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forevermore knows that I do not lie.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and through a window I was let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
