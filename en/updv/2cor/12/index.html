Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions and distresses, for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become foolish: you{+} compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you{+}: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you{+} in all patience, both by signs and wonders, and mighty works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For what is there in which you{+} were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except [it is] that I myself was not a burden to you{+}? Forgive me this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Look, this is the third time I am ready to come to you{+}; and I will not be a burden to you{+}: for I don't seek yours{+}, but you{+}: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your{+} souls. If I love you{+} more abundantly, am I loved the less?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But let it be so, I did not myself burden you{+}; but, being crafty, I caught you{+} with guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Did I take advantage of you{+} by any one of them whom I have sent to you{+}?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you{+}? Did we not walk in the same spirit? [Did we] not [walk] in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You{+} think all this time that we are excusing ourselves to you{+}. In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, [are] for your{+} edifying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you{+} not such as I want, and should myself be found of you{+} such as you{+} do not want; lest by any means [there should be] strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>lest again when I come my God should humble me before you{+}, and I should mourn for many of those who have sinned before, and didn't repent of the impurity and fornication and sexual immorality in which they participated.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
