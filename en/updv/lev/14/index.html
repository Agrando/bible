and see if the plague is in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, and its appearance is lower than the wall;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>then the priest will go out of the house to the door of the house, and shut up the house seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the priest will come again the seventh day, and will look; and see if the plague has spread in the walls of the house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>then the priest will command that they take out the stones in which the plague is, and cast them into an unclean place outside the city:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and he will cause the house to be scraped inside round about, and they will pour out the mortar, that they scrape off, outside the city into an unclean place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they will take other stones, and put them in the place of those stones; and he will take other mortar, and will plaster the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house, after that he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped the house, and after it is plastered;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>then the priest will come in and look; and see if the plague has spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he will break down the house, the stones of it, and its timber, and all the mortar of the house; and he will carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Moreover he who goes into the house all the while that it is shut up will be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he who lies in the house will wash his clothes; and he who eats in the house will wash his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And if the priest will come in, and look, and see that the plague has not spread in the house, after the house was plastered; then the priest will pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he will take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and he will kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and he will take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and he will cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>but he will let go the living bird out of the city into the open field: so he will make atonement for the house; and it will be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This is the law for every manner of plague of leprosy, and for a scall,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and for the leprosy of a garment, and for a house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
