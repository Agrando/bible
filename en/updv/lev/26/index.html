and you{+} will eat your{+} bread to the full, and dwell in your{+} land safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will give peace in the land, and you{+} will lie down, and none will make you{+} afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither will the sword go through your{+} land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And you{+} will chase your{+} enemies, and they will fall before you{+} by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And five of you{+} will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you{+} will chase ten thousand; and your{+} enemies will fall before you{+} by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will have respect to you{+}, and make you{+} fruitful, and multiply you{+}, and will establish my covenant with you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And you{+} will eat old store long kept, and you{+} will bring forth the old because of the new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will set my tabernacle among you{+}: and my soul will not abhor you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will walk among you{+}, and will be your{+} God, and you{+} will be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I am Yahweh your{+} God, who brought you{+} forth out of the land of Egypt, that you{+} should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bars of your{+} yoke, and made you{+} go upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you{+} will not listen to me, and will not do all these commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if you{+} will reject my statutes, and if your{+} soul abhors my ordinances, so that you{+} will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I also will do this to you{+}: I will appoint terror over you{+}, even consumption and fever, that will consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and you{+} will sow your{+} seed in vain, for your{+} enemies will eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will set my face against you{+}, and you{+} will be struck before your{+} enemies: those who hate you{+} will rule over you{+}; and you{+} will flee when none pursues you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if you{+} will not yet for these things listen to me, then I will chastise you{+} seven times more for your{+} sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will break the pride of your{+} power: and I will make your{+} heaven as iron, and your{+} earth as bronze;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and your{+} strength will be spent in vain; for your{+} land will not yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land yield their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And if you{+} walk contrary to me, and will not listen to me, I will bring seven times more plagues on you{+} according to your{+} sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will send the beast of the field among you{+}, which will rob you{+} of your{+} children, and destroy your{+} cattle, and make you{+} few in number; and your{+} ways will become desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if by these things you{+} will not be reformed to me, but will walk contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then I will also walk contrary to you{+}; and I will strike you{+}, even I, seven times for your{+} sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will bring a sword on you{+}, that will execute the vengeance of the covenant; and you{+} will be gathered together inside your{+} cities: and I will send the pestilence among you{+}; and you{+} will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When I break your{+} staff of bread, ten women will bake your{+} bread in one oven, and they will deliver your{+} bread again by weight: and you{+} will eat, and not be satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if you{+} will not for all this listen to me, but walk contrary to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then I will walk contrary to you{+} in wrath; and I also will chastise you{+} seven times for your{+} sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And you{+} will eat the flesh of your{+} sons, and the flesh of your{+} daughters you{+} will eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will destroy your{+} high places, and cut down your{+} sun-images, and cast your{+} dead bodies on the bodies of your{+} idols; and my soul will abhor you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will make your{+} cities a waste, and will bring your{+} sanctuaries to desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your{+} sweet odors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I will bring the land into desolation; and your{+} enemies that dwell in it will be astonished at it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And you{+} I will scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you{+}: and your{+} land will be a desolation, and your{+} cities will be a waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then will the land enjoy its Sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you{+} are in your{+} enemies' land; even then will the land rest, and enjoy its Sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As long as it lies desolate it will have rest, even the rest which it did not have in your{+} Sabbaths, when you{+} dwelt on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as for those who are left of you{+}, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf will chase them; and they will flee, as one flees from the sword; and they will fall when none pursues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they will stumble one on another, as it were before the sword, when none pursues: and you{+} will have no power to stand before your{+} enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And you{+} will perish among the nations, and the land of your{+} enemies will eat you{+} up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who are left of you{+} will pine away in their iniquity in your{+} enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers they will pine away with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they will confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>then I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham I will remember; and I will remember the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its Sabbaths, while it lies desolate without them: and they will accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them completely, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made between him and the sons of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
