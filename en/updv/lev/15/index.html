All the days that his flesh runs his discharge or that his flesh withholds his discharge, it is his uncleanness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Every bed on which he who has the discharge lies will be unclean; and everything on which he sits will be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And whoever touches his bed will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he who sits on anything on which he who has the discharge sat will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he who touches the flesh of him who has the discharge will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean, then he will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And whatever saddle he who has the discharge rides on will be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whoever touches anything that was under him will be unclean until the evening: and he who bears those things will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whomever he who has the discharge touches, without having rinsed his hands in water, he will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the earthen vessel, which he who has the discharge touches, will be broken; and every vessel of wood will be rinsed in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge, then he will number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes; and he will bathe his flesh in running water, and will be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And on the eighth day he will take to himself two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, and come before Yahweh to the door of the tent of meeting, and give them to the priest:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the priest will offer them, the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering; and the priest will make atonement for him before Yahweh for his discharge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if any man's semen goes out from him, then he will bathe all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And every garment, and every skin, on which is the semen, will be washed with water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if a woman will lie with a man, with an emission of semen, they will both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if a woman has a [genital] discharge, [and] her discharge in her flesh is blood, she will be in her impurity seven days: and whoever touches her will be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And everything that she lies on in her impurity will be unclean: everything also that she sits on will be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whoever touches her bed will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whoever touches anything that she sits on will wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And if it is on the bed, or on anything on which she sits, when he touches it, he will be unclean until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if any man lies with her, and her impurity is on him, he will be unclean seven days;
