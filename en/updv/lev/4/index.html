and he will lay his hand on the head of the bull, and kill the bull before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the anointed priest will take of the blood of the bull, and bring it to the tent of meeting:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the priest will dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before Yahweh, before the veil of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the priest will put of the blood on the horns of the altar of sweet incense before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting; and all the blood of the bull he will pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all the fat of the bull of the sin-offering he will take off from it; the fat that covers the insides, and all the fat that is on the insides,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the caul on the liver, with the kidneys, he will take away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as it is taken off from the ox of the sacrifice of peace-offerings: and the priest will burn them on the altar of burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the skin of the bull, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its insides, and its dung,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>even the whole bull he will carry forth outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out it will be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if the whole congregation of Israel should err, and the thing has been hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and are guilty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>when the sin in which they have sinned is known, then the assembly will offer a young bull for a sin-offering, and bring it before the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the elders of the congregation will lay their hands on the head of the bull before Yahweh; and the bull will be killed before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the anointed priest will bring of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the priest will dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before Yahweh, before the veil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he will put of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before Yahweh in the tent of meeting; and all the blood he will pour out at the base of the altar of burnt-offering, which is at the door of the tent of meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all its fat he will take off from it, and burn it on the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus he will do with the bull; as he did with the bull of the sin-offering, so he will do with this; and the priest will make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he will carry forth the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull: it is the sin-offering for the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>When a ruler sins, and does unintentionally any one of all the things which Yahweh his God has commanded not to be done, and is guilty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>if his sin, in which he has sinned, is made known to him, he will bring for his oblation a goat, a male without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he will lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where the burnt-offering will be killed before Yahweh: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the priest will take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt-offering;

and all its blood he will pour out at the base of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And all its fat he will take away, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest will burn it on the altar for a sweet savor to Yahweh; and the priest will make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And if he brings a lamb as his oblation for a sin-offering, he will bring it a female without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he will lay his hand on the head of the sin-offering, and kill it for a sin-offering in the place where the burnt-offering will be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the priest will take of the blood of the sin-offering with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt-offering; and all its blood he will pour out at the base of the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and all its fat he will take away, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of peace-offerings; and the priest will burn them on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin that he has sinned, and he will be forgiven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
