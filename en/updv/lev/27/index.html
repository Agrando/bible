if it is a male, then your estimation will be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if he is poorer than your estimation, then he will be set before the priest, and the priest will value him; according to the ability of him who vowed will the priest value him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if it is a beast, of which men offer an oblation to Yahweh, all that any man gives of such to Yahweh will be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He will not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he will at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed will be holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if it is any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation to Yahweh, then he will set the beast before the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the priest will value it, whether it is good or bad: as you the priest value it, so it will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if he will indeed redeem it, then he will add the fifth part of it to your estimation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when a man will sanctify his house to be holy to Yahweh, then the priest will estimate it, whether it is good or bad: as the priest will estimate it, so it will stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if he who sanctified it will redeem his house, then he will add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it will be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if a man will sanctify to Yahweh part of the field of his possession, then your estimation will be according to its sowing: the sowing of a homer of barley [will be valued] at fifty shekels of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it will stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest will reckon to him the money according to the years that remain to the year of jubilee; and an abatement will be made from your estimation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if he who sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he will add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it will be assured to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it will not be redeemed anymore:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, will be holy to Yahweh, as a field devoted; its possession will be the priest's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if he sanctifies to Yahweh a field which he has bought, which is not of the field of his possession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then the priest will reckon to him the worth of your estimation to the year of jubilee: and he will give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In the year of jubilee the field will return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all your estimations will be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs will be the shekel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Only the firstborn among beasts, which is made a firstborn to Yahweh, no man will sanctify it; whether it is ox or sheep, it is Yahweh's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if it is of an unclean beast, then he will ransom it according to your estimation, and will add to it the fifth part of it: or if it is not redeemed, then it will be sold according to your estimation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man will devote to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, will be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>No one devoted, that will be devoted from among man, will be ransomed; he will surely be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the tithe of the land, of the seed of the land, of the fruit of the tree, is Yahweh's: it is holy to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if a man will redeem anything of his tithe, he will add to it the fifth part of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the rod, the tenth will be holy to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will not search whether it is good or bad, neither will he change it: and if he changes it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed will be holy; it will not be redeemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>These are the commandments, which Yahweh commanded Moses for the sons of Israel in mount Sinai.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
