Look, we will not sow, nor gather in our increase;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then I will command my blessing on you{+} in the sixth year, and it will bring forth fruit for the three years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you{+} will sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits, the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in, you{+} will eat the old store.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the land will not be sold in perpetuity; for the land is mine: for you{+} are strangers and sojourners with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in all the land of your{+} possession you{+} will grant a redemption for the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If your brother is waxed poor, and sells some of his possession, then his kinsman who is next to him will come, and will redeem that which his brother has sold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if a man has no one to redeem it, and he is waxed rich and finds enough to redeem it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>then let him reckon the years of its sale, and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it; and he will return to his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if he is not able to get it back for himself, then that which he has sold will remain in the hand of him who has bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it will go out, and he will return to his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if a man sells a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; for a full year he will have the right of redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city will be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations: it will not go out in the jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them will be reckoned with the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they will go out in the jubilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when one of the Levites redeems, the house that was sold, in the the city of his possession, will go out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And if your brother is waxed poor, and his hand fails with you; then you will uphold him: [as] a stranger [who is a] sojourner he will live with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Take no interest of him or increase, but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You will not give him your money on interest, nor give him your victuals for increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I am Yahweh your{+} God, who brought you{+} forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you{+} the land of Canaan, [and] to be your{+} God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And if your brother is waxed poor with you, and sells himself to you; you will not make him to serve as a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As a hired worker, and as a sojourner, he will be with you; he will serve with you to the year of jubilee:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and then he will go out from you, he and his sons with him, and then will return to his own family, and to the possession of his fathers he will return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For they are my slaves, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they will not be sold as a slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You will not rule over him with rigor, but will fear your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And as for your male slave, and your female slave, whom you will have; of the nations that are round about you{+}, of them you{+} will buy a male slave and a female slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Moreover of the sons of the strangers who sojourn among you{+}, of them you{+} will buy, and of their families who are with you{+}, which they have begotten in your{+} land: and they will be your{+} possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And you{+} will make them an inheritance for your{+} sons after you{+}, to hold for a possession; of them you{+} will take your{+} slaves forever: but over your{+} brothers the sons of Israel you{+} will not rule, one over another, with rigor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if a stranger [who is a] sojourner with you is waxed rich, and your brother is waxed poor beside him, and sells himself to a stranger [who is a] sojourner with you, or to the stock of the stranger's family;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>after he is sold he may be redeemed: one of his brothers may redeem him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any who is near of kin to him of his family may redeem him; or if he is waxed rich, he may redeem himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he will reckon with him who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale will be according to the number of years; according to the time of a hired worker he will be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>If there are yet many years, according to them he will give back the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And if there remain but few years to the year of jubilee, then he will reckon with him; according to his years he will give back the price of his redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>As a worker hired year by year he will be with him: he will not rule with rigor over him in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And if he is not redeemed by these [means], then he will go out in the year of jubilee, he, and his sons with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For to me the sons of Israel are slaves; they are my slaves whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am Yahweh your{+} God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
