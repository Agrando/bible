and the priest will look at him, and pronounce him unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and its hair has not turned white, then the priest will shut up [him who has] the plague seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the priest will look at him the seventh day: and see if, in his eyes, the plague has stopped, the plague has not spread in the skin, then the priest will shut him up seven days more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and the priest will look at him again the seventh day; and see if the plague is dim, and the plague has not spread in the skin, then the priest will pronounce him clean: it is a scab: and he will wash his clothes, and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if the scab spreads abroad in the skin, after he has shown himself to the priest for his cleansing, he will show himself to the priest again:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the priest will look; and see if the scab has spread in the skin, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When the plague of leprosy is in man, then he will be brought to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the priest will look; and see if there is a white rising in the skin, and it has turned the hair white, and there is quick raw flesh in the rising,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest will pronounce him unclean: he will not shut him up, for he is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if the leprosy breaks out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy covers all the skin of [him who has] the plague from his head even to his feet, as far as appears to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>then the priest will look; and see if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he will pronounce [him] clean [who has] the plague: it has all turned white: he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he will be unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the priest will look at the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean: the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Or if the raw flesh turns again, and has changed to white, then he will come to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the priest will look at him; and see if the plague has turned into white, then the priest will pronounce [him] clean [who has] the plague: he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the flesh has a boil on it, and it is healed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and in the place of the boil there is a white rising, or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it will be shown to the priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the priest will look; and see if its appearance is lower than the skin, and its hair has turned white, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy, it has broken out in the boil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the priest looks at it and sees there are no white hairs in it, and it is not lower than the skin, but is dim; then the priest will shut him up seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if it spreads abroad in the skin, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if the bright spot remains in its place, and has not spread, it is the scar of the boil; and the priest will pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Or when the flesh has in its skin a burning by fire, and the quick [flesh] of the burning becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>then the priest will look at it; and see if the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and its appearance is deeper than the skin; it is leprosy, it has broken out in the burning: and the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if the priest looks at it, and sees there is no white hair in the bright spot, and it is no lower than the skin, but is dim; then the priest will shut him up seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the priest will look at him the seventh day: if it spreads abroad in the skin, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And if the bright spot remains in its place, and has not spread in the skin, but is dim; it is the rising of the burning, and the priest will pronounce him clean: for it is the scar of the burning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when a man or woman has a plague on the head or on the beard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>then the priest will look at the plague; and see if its appearance is deeper than the skin, and there is in it yellow thin hair, then the priest will pronounce him unclean: it is a scall, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if the priest looks at the plague of the scall, and sees its appearance is not deeper than the skin, and there is no black hair in it, then the priest will shut up [him who has] the plague of the scall seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And in the seventh day the priest will look at the plague; and see if the scall has not spread, and there is in it no yellow hair, and the appearance of the scall is not deeper than the skin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>then he will be shaven, but the scall he will not shave; and the priest will shut up [him who has] the scall seven days more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and in the seventh day the priest will look at the scall; and see if the scall has not spread in the skin, and its appearance is not deeper than the skin; then the priest will pronounce him clean: and he will wash his clothes, and be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if the scall spreads abroad in the skin after his cleansing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>then the priest will look at him; and see if the scall has spread in the skin, the priest will not seek for the yellow hair; he is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But if in his eyes the scall has stopped, and black hair has grown up in it; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest will pronounce him clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when a man or a woman has in the skin of the flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then the priest will look; and see if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh are of a dull white, it is a tetter, it has broken out in the skin; he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And if a man's hair falls off his head, he is bald; [yet] he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And if his hair falls off from the front part of his head, he is bald [on the] forehead; [yet] he is clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead, a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his bald head, or his bald forehead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then the priest will look at him; and see if the rising of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>he is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest will surely pronounce him unclean; his plague is in his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes will be rent, and the hair of his head will go loose, and he will cover his upper lip, and will cry, Unclean, unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>All the days in which the plague is in him he will be unclean; he is unclean: he will dwell alone; outside the camp will be his dwelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it is a wool garment, or a linen garment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>whether it is in warp, or woof; of linen, or of wool; whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin; it is the plague of leprosy, and will be shown to the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And the priest will look at the plague, and shut up [that which has] the plague seven days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and he will look at the plague on the seventh day: if the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever service skin is used for; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he will burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or anything of skin, in which the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it will be burnt in the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And if the priest will look, and see that the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>then the priest will command that they wash the thing in which the plague is, and he will shut it up seven days more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and the priest will look, after the plague is washed; and see if the plague has not changed its color, and the plague has not spread, it is unclean; you will burn it in the fire: it is a fret, whether the bareness be inside or outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And if the priest looks and sees that the plague is dim after the washing of it, then he will rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>and if it still appears in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is breaking out: you will burn that in which the plague is with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And the garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing of skin it is, which you will wash, if the plague departs from them, then it will be washed the second time, and will be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or anything of skin, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
