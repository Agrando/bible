when he knows of it, then he will be guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or if anyone swears rashly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever man utters rashly with an oath, and it is hid from him; when he knows of it, then he will be guilty in one of these [things].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it will be, when he will be guilty in one of these [things], that he will confess that in which he has sinned:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and he will bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh for his sin which he has sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin-offering; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if his means are not sufficient for a lamb, then he will bring his trespass-offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, to Yahweh; one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he will bring them to the priest, who will offer that which is for the sin-offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but will not divide it apart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he will sprinkle of the blood of the sin-offering on the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood will be drained out at the base of the altar: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he will offer the second for a burnt-offering, according to the ordinance; and the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if his means are not sufficient for two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he will bring his oblation for that in which he has sinned, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin-offering: he will put no oil on it, neither will he put any frankincense on it; for it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will bring it to the priest, and the priest will take his handful of it as its memorial, and burn it on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: it is a sin-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest will make atonement for him as concerning his sin that he has sinned in any of these things, and he will be forgiven: and it will be the priest's, as the meal-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If anyone commits a trespass, and sins unintentionally, in the holy things of Yahweh; then he will bring his trespass-offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation in silver by shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass-offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he will make restitution for that which he has done amiss in the holy thing, and will add the fifth part thereto, and give it to the priest; and the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering, and he will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if anyone sins, and does any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done; though he didn't know it, yet he is guilty, and will bear his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he will bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass-offering, to the priest; and the priest will make atonement for him concerning the thing in which he erred unintentionally and didn't know it, and he will be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>It is a trespass-offering: he is certainly guilty before Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
