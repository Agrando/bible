This will be a statute forever to them throughout their generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And you will say to them, Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who offers a burnt-offering or sacrifice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and does not bring it to the door of the tent of meeting, to sacrifice it to Yahweh; that man will be cut off from his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who eats any manner of blood, I will set my face against that soul that eats blood, and will cut him off from among his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the soul of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you{+} on the altar to make atonement for your{+} souls: for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I said to the sons of Israel, No soul of you{+} will eat blood, neither will any stranger who sojourns among you{+} eat blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And any man of the sons of Israel, or of the strangers who sojourn among them, who takes in hunting any beast or bird that may be eaten; he will pour out its blood, and cover it with dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the soul of all flesh is its blood, which is in its living body.
