And whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man who has an emission of semen go out from him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>or whoever touches any creeping thing, by which he may be made unclean, or man who is unclean to him, whatever uncleanness he has;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>the soul who touches any such will be unclean until the evening, and will not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the sun has gone down, he will be clean; and afterward he will eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That which dies of itself, or is torn of beasts, he will not eat, to defile himself with it: I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They will therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die in it, if they profane it: I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And no stranger will eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest's, or a hired worker, will not eat of the holy thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But if a priest buys any soul, the purchase of his money, he will eat of it, and one who is born in his house, they will eat of his bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a priest's daughter is married to a stranger, she will not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if a priest's daughter is a widow, or divorced, and has no child, and is returned to her father's house, as in her youth, she will eat of her father's bread: but no stranger will eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if a man eats of the holy thing unintentionally, then he will put the fifth part of it to it, and will give to the priest the holy thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they will not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they offer to Yahweh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and [so] cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the sons of Israel, and say to them, Any man of the house of Israel, and from every sojourner who sojourns in Israel, who offers his oblation, whether it is any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer to Yahweh for a burnt-offering;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>that you{+} may be accepted, [you{+} will offer] a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But whatever has a blemish, that you{+} will not offer: for it will not be acceptable for you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And whoever offers a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Yahweh to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it will be perfect to be accepted; there will be no blemish in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, you{+} will not offer these to Yahweh, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Either a bull or a lamb that has anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that you may offer for a freewill-offering;

you{+} will leave none of it until the morning: I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore you{+} will keep my commandments, and do them: I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And you{+} will not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the sons of Israel: I am Yahweh who hallows you{+},</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who brought you{+} out of the land of Egypt, to be your{+} God: I am Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
