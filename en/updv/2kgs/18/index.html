And the king of Assyria appointed to Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah gave [him] all the silver that was found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time Hezekiah cut off [the gold from] the doors of the temple of Yahweh, and [from] the pillars which Hezekiah king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rab-saris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great army to Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they had come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they had called to the king, there came out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebnah the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Rabshakeh said to them, Say{+} now to Hezekiah, Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which you trust?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You say (but they are but vain words), [There is] counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom do you trust, that you have rebelled against me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now, look, you trust on the staff of this bruised reed, even on Egypt; on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if you{+} say to me, We trust in Yahweh our God; isn't that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You{+} will worship before this altar in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore, I pray you, give pledges to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>How then can you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master's slaves, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have I now come up without Yahweh against this place to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, said to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your slaves in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and don't speak with us in the Jews' language, in the ears of the people who are on the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Rabshakeh said to them, Has my master sent me to your master, and to you, to speak these words? [Has he] not [sent me] to the men who sit on the wall, to eat their own feces, and to drink their own urine with you{+}?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and spoke, saying, Hear{+} the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Thus says the king, Don't let Hezekiah deceive you{+}; for he will not be able to deliver you{+} out of his hand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>neither let Hezekiah make you{+} trust in Yahweh, saying, Yahweh will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Don't listen to Hezekiah: for thus says the king of Assyria, Make your{+} peace with me, and come out to me; and eat{+} every one of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink{+} every one the waters of his own cistern;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Until I come and take you{+} away to a land like your{+} own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive-trees and of honey, that you{+} may live, and not die: and don't listen to Hezekiah, when he persuades you{+}, saying, Yahweh will deliver us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Have any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that Yahweh should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But the people held their peace, and did not answer him a word; for the king's commandment was, saying, Don't answer him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah came, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
