And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way of the wilderness of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom; and they made a circuit of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, nor for the beasts that followed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king of Israel said, Alas! For Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of Yahweh, that we may inquire of Yahweh by him? And one of the king of Israel's slaves answered and said, Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of Yahweh is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother. And the king of Israel said to him, No; for Yahweh has called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Elisha said, As Yahweh of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of Yahweh came upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, Thus says Yahweh, Make this valley full of trenches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus says Yahweh, You{+} will not see wind, neither will you{+} see rain; yet that valley will be filled with water, and you{+} will drink, both you{+} and your{+} cattle and your{+} beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this is but a light thing in the sight of Yahweh: he will also deliver the Moabites into your{+} hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you{+} will strike every fortified city, and every choice city, and will fell every good tree, and stop all fountains of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass in the morning, about the time of offering the oblation, that, look, water came by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now when all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, they gathered themselves together, all who were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood on the border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water across from them as red as blood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely destroyed, and they have struck each man his fellow man: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled before them; and they went there and struck the Moabites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they beat down the cities; and on every good piece of land they cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the fountains of water, and felled all the good trees, until they left [only] its stones in Kir-hareseth; nevertheless the slingers went about it, and struck it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too intense for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew the sword, to break through to the king of Syria; but they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he took his eldest son who should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt-offering on the wall. And there was great wrath against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
