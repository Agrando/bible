Tell me; what do you have in the house? And she said, Your slave doesn't have anything in the house, but a pot of oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then he said, Go, borrow for yourself vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; don't borrow a few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And you will go in, and shut the door on you and on your sons, and pour out into all those vessels; and you will set aside that which is full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons; they brought [the vessels] to her, and she poured out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me another vessel. And he said to her, There is not another vessel. And the oil stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and you and your sons live from the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where there was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she said to her husband, Look now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, that passes by us continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let us make, I pray you, a little chamber on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand: and it will be, when he comes to us, that he will turn in there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and lay there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to Gehazi his attendant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to him, Say now to her, Look, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? Would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly she has no son, and her husband is old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, At this season, when the time comes round, you will embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the woman became pregnant, and gave birth to a son at that season, when the time came round, as Elisha had said to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to his attendant, Carry him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut [the door] on him, and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the attendants, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor Sabbath. And she said, It will be well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her attendant, Drive, and go forward; don't slow down the riding for me, except I bid you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So she went, and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her far off, that he said to Gehazi his attendant, Look, yonder is the Shunammite:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>run, I pray you, now to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught hold of his feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone: for her soul is vexed inside her; and Yahweh has hid it from me, and has not told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, Don't deceive me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, don't greet him; and if any greets you, don't answer him again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the mother of the child said, As Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, saying, The child did not awaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when Elisha came into the house, look, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He went in therefore, and shut the door on both of them, and prayed to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and he stretched himself on him; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then he returned, and walked in the house once to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, Take up your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground; and she took up her son, and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Elisha came again to Gilgal. And there was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his attendant, Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered of it wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage; for they did not know them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And there came a man from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And his minister said, What, should I set this before a hundred men? But he said, Give the people, that they may eat; for thus says Yahweh, They will eat, and will have some left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>So he set it before them, and they ate, and had some left, according to the word of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
