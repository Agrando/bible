And Elisha laid his hands on the king's hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Open the window eastward; and he opened it. Then Elisha said, Shoot; and he shot. And he said, Yahweh's arrow of victory, even the arrow of victory over Syria; for you will strike the Syrians in Aphek, until you have consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, Take the arrows; and he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Strike on the ground; and he struck three times, and stopped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the man of God was angry with him, and said, You should have struck five or six times: then you would have struck Syria until you had consumed it, whereas now you will strike Syria but three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Elisha died, and they buried him. Now the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, look, they spied a band; and they hastily put the man into the tomb of Elisha. And they went [in], and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Yahweh was gracious to them, and had compassion on them, and had respect to them, because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither did he cast them from his presence as yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times Joash struck him, and recovered the cities of Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
