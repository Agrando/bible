And Jehu wrote letters to the rulers of Samaria, to the elders of Jezreel, and to the tutors [appointed by] Ahab, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And now as soon as this letter comes to you{+}, seeing your{+} master's sons are with you{+}, and there are with you{+} chariots and horses, and a fortified city, and armor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>look{+} for the best and meet of your{+} master's sons, and set him on his father's throne, and fight for your{+} master's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Look, the two kings didn't stand before him: how then shall we stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he who was over the household, and he who was over the city, the elders also, and those who brought up [the children], sent to Jehu, saying, We are your slaves, and will do all that you will bid us; we will not make any man king: do that which is good in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you{+} are on my side, and if you{+} will listen to my voice, take{+} the heads of the men your{+} master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, who brought them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king's sons, and slew them, even seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to him to Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay{+} them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You{+} are righteous: look, I conspired against my master, and slew him; but who struck all these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now know that nothing will fall to the earth of the word of Yahweh, which Yahweh spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for Yahweh has done that which he spoke by his slave Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Jehu struck all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and those who he knew well, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he arose and departed, and went to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing-house of the shepherds in the way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you{+}? And they answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah: and we go down to greet the sons of the king and the sons of the queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing-house, even two and forty men; neither did he leave any of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had departed from there, he found Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him; and he greeted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it is, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for Yahweh. So they made him ride in his chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he came to Samaria, he struck all who remained to Ahab in Samaria, until he had destroyed him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke to Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu will serve him much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice [to do] to Baal; whoever will be wanting, he will not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshipers of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshipers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that didn't come. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was filled from one end to another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to him who was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshipers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal; and he said to the worshipers of Baal, Search and look, in case there are here with you{+} any of the slaves of Yahweh, but only the worshipers of Baal themselves [should be here].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings. Now Jehu had appointed himself eighty men outside, and said, If any of the men whom I bring into your{+} hands escape, [he who lets him go], his life will be for the life of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt-offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they struck them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the citadel of the house of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they brought forth the pillars that were in the house of Baal, and burned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they broke down the pillar of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it an outside latrine, to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Nevertheless from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin, Jehu didn't depart from after them, [to wit], the golden calves that were in Beth-el, and that were in Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Yahweh said to Jehu, Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, [and] have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your sons of the fourth generation will sit on the throne of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of Yahweh, the God of Israel, with all his heart: he did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, with which he made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In those days Yahweh began to cut off from Israel: and Hazael struck them in all the borders of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>from the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jehu slept with his fathers; and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty and eight years.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
