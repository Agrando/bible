for the children have come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It may be Yahweh your God will hear all the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God, and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard: therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant who is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the slaves of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Isaiah said to them, Thus you{+} will say to your{+} master, Thus says Yahweh, Don't be afraid of the words that you have heard, with which the attendants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Look, I will put a spirit in him, and he will hear [some] news, and will return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when he heard it said of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Look, he has come out to fight against you, he sent messengers again to Hezekiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus you{+} will speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Don't let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them completely: and will you be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Have the gods of the nations delivered them, which my fathers have destroyed, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were in Telassar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of Yahweh, and spread it before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Hezekiah prayed before Yahweh, and said, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, who sits [above] the cherubim, you are the God, even you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; you have made heaven and earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Incline your ear, O Yahweh, and hear; open your eyes, O Yahweh, and see; and hear the words of Sennacherib, with which he has sent him to defy the living God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Of a truth, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of man's hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now therefore, O Yahweh our God, save us, I urge you, out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you Yahweh are God alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Whereas you have prayed to me against Sennacherib king of Assyria, I have heard [you].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is the word that Yahweh has spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Whom have you defied and blasphemed? And against whom have you exalted your voice and lifted up your eyes on high? [Even] against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By your messengers you have defied the Lord, and have said, When I mount my chariot I will come up to the height of the mountains, to the innermost parts of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, and its choice fir-trees; and I will enter into its farthest lodging-place, its park forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have dug and drank strange waters, and with the sole of my feet I will dry up all the rivers of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Have you not heard how I had done it long ago, and formed it of ancient times? Now I have brought it to pass, that it should be yours to lay waste fortified cities into ruinous heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field, and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as grain blighted before it is grown up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I know your rising up, and your sitting down, and your going out, and your coming in, and your raging against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance has come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in your nose, and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you back by the way by which you came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this will be the sign to you: You{+} will eat this year that which grows of itself, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year you{+} will sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the remnant that has escaped of the house of Judah will again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For out of Jerusalem will go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion those who will escape: the zeal of Yahweh will perform this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, He will not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>By the way that he came, by the same he will return, and he will not come to this city, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake, and for my slave David's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Yahweh went forth, and struck 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians: and when men arose early in the morning, look, these were all dead bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esar-haddon his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
