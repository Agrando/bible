So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of Yahweh, and in the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him on horses; and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king slept with his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah, Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, [and reigned] forty and one years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: he did not depart from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, with which he made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of Hamath to the sea of the Arabah, according to the word of Yahweh, the God of Israel, which he spoke by his slave Jonah the son of Amittai, the prophet, who was of Gath-hepher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Yahweh saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was none shut up nor left at large, neither was there any helper for Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Yahweh didn't say that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, [which had belonged] to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of Israel; and Zechariah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
