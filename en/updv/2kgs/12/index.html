Now therefore take no [more] money from your{+} acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the priests consented that they should take no [more] money from the people, neither repair the breaches of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as one comes into the house of Yahweh: and the priests who kept the threshold put in it all the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and they put in bags and counted the money that was found in the house of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they gave the money that was weighed out into the hands of those who did the work, that had the oversight of the house of Yahweh: and they paid it out to the carpenters and the builders, that wrought on the house of Yahweh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and to the masons and the hewers of stone, and for buying timber and cut stone to repair the breaches of the house of Yahweh, and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But there were not made for the house of Yahweh cups of silver, snuffers, basins, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the house of Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for they gave that to those who did the work, and repaired the house of Yahweh with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moreover they didn't reckon with the men, into whose hand they delivered the money to give to those who did the work; for they dealt faithfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The money for the trespass-offerings, and the money for the sin-offerings, was not brought into the house of Yahweh: it was the priests'.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and of the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And his slaves arose, and made a conspiracy, and struck Joash at the house of Millo, [on the way] that goes down to Silla.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Jozacar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of Shomer, his slaves, struck him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
