And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your slaves have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered to me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he rent his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's slave, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go{+}, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that was found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is kindled against us, because our fathers haven't listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter); and they communed with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to them, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: Tell{+} the man who sent you{+} to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says Yahweh, Look, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands, therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But to the king of Judah, who sent you{+} to inquire of Yahweh, thus you{+} will say to him, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: As concerning the words which you have heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before Yahweh, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against its inhabitants, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, look, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace, neither will your eyes see all the evil which I will bring on this place.
