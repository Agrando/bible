And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Yahweh said to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, you, and Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and say to him, Take heed, and be quiet; don't be afraid, neither let your heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against you, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach in it for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, It will not stand, neither will it come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin; and within threescore and five years will Ephraim be broken in pieces, so that it will not be a people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you{+} will not believe, surely you{+} will not be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Yahweh spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Ask a sign of Yahweh your God; ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I try Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, Hear{+} now, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you{+} to weary men, that you{+} will weary my God also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore the Lord himself will give you{+} a sign: look, the young woman will be pregnant, and give birth to a son, and will call his name Immanuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Butter and honey he will eat, when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For before the child will know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings you abhor will be forsaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yahweh will bring on you, and on your people, and on your father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah--[even] the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it will come to pass in that day, that Yahweh will hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they will come, and will rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all thorn-hedges, and on all pastures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day the Lord will shave with a razor that is hired in the parts beyond the River, [even] with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet; and it will also consume the beard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it will come to pass in that day, that a man will keep alive a young cow, and two sheep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and it will come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they will give he will eat butter: for butter and honey will every one eat who is left in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it will come to pass in that day, that every place, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, will be for briers and thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>With arrows and with bow will one come there, because all the land will be briers and thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the hills that were dug with the mattock, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but it will be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
