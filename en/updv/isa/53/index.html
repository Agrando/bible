And to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he has no form nor majesty; and when we see him, there is no appearance that we should desire him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we did not esteem him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, struck of God, and afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was on him; and with his stripes we are healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>All of us like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn't open his mouth; as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute, so he didn't open his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and who considered his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; because of the transgression of my people he was stricken to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they made his grave with the wicked, and his tomb with the rich; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him who was made sick. If his soul makes an offering for sin, [then] he will see [his] seed, he will prolong his days, and the pleasure of Yahweh will prosper in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He will see the light of the travail of his soul, [and] will be satisfied: by his knowledge will my righteous slave justify many; and he will bear their iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he will divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for their sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
