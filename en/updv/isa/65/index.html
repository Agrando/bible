These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Look, it is written before me: I will not keep silent, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>your{+} own iniquities, and the iniquities of your{+} fathers together, says Yahweh, that have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore I will first measure their work into their bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Thus says Yahweh, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, Don't destroy it, for a blessing is in it: so I will do for my slaves' sake, that I may not destroy them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen will inherit it, and my slaves will stay there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Sharon will be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you{+} who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mingled wine to Destiny;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will destine you{+} to the sword, and you{+} will all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you{+} did not answer; when I spoke, you{+} did not hear; but you{+} did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, my slaves will eat, but you{+} will be hungry; look, my slaves will drink, but you{+} will be thirsty; look, my slaves will rejoice, but you{+} will be put to shame;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>look, my slaves will sing for joy of heart, but you{+} will cry for sorrow of heart, and will wail for vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you{+} will leave your{+} name for a curse to my chosen; and the Sovereign Yahweh will slay you; and he will call his slaves by another name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so that he who blesses himself in the earth will bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth will swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For, look, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things will not be remembered, nor come into mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But be{+} glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, look, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there will be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There will be no more from there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child will die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old will be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they will build houses, and inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They will not build, and another inhabit; they will not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree will be the days of my people, and my chosen will long enjoy the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They will not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh, and their offspring with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it will come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The wolf and the lamb will be shepherded together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox; and dust will be the serpent's food. They will not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
