Or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you{+}? Look, for your{+} iniquities you{+} were sold, and for your{+} transgressions your{+} mother was put away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Why, when I came, was there no man? When I called, was there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it can't redeem? Or have I no power to deliver? Look, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink, because there is no water, and die for thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Sovereign Yahweh has given me the tongue of those who are taught, that I may know how to sustain with words him who is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as those who are taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The Sovereign Yahweh has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I gave my back to the strikers, and my cheeks to those who plucked off the hair; I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the Sovereign Yahweh will help me; therefore I have not been confounded: therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I will not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? Let us stand up together: who is my adversary? Let him come near to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Look, the Sovereign Yahweh will help me; who is he who will condemn me? Look, they will all wax old as a garment, the moth will eat them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Who is among you{+} that fears Yahweh, that obeys the voice of his slave? He who walks in darkness, and has no light, let him trust in the name of Yahweh, and rely on his God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Look, all you{+} who kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands; walk{+} in the flame of your{+} fire, and among the brands that you{+} have kindled. This you{+} will have of my hand: you{+} will lie down in a place of pain.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
