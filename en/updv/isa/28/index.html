And whom will he make to understand the message? Those who are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it is precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>No, but by [men of] strange lips and with another tongue he will speak to this people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>to whom he said, This is the rest, give{+} rest to him who is weary; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore will the word of Yahweh be to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, there a little; that they may go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore hear the word of Yahweh, you{+} scoffers, that rule this people who is in Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Because you{+} have said, We have made a covenant with death, and we are at agreement with Sheol; when the overflowing scourge will pass through, it will not come to us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood we have hid ourselves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner-[stone] of sure foundation: he who believes will not be caused to flee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will make justice the line, and righteousness the plummet; and the hail will sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters will overflow the hiding-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And your{+} covenant with death will be annulled, and your{+} agreement with Sheol will not stand; when the overflowing scourge will pass through, then you{+} will be trodden down by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As often as it passes through, it will take you{+}; for morning by morning it will pass through, by day and by night: and it will be nothing but terror to understand the message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it; and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Yahweh will rise up as in mount Perazim, he will be angry as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his work, his strange work, and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore don't be{+} scoffers, or else your{+} bonds will be made strong; for a decree of destruction I have heard from the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, on the whole earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Give{+} ear, and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Does he who plows to sow plow continually? Does he [continually] open and harrow his ground?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When he has leveled its face, does he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cumin, and put in the wheat in rows, and the barley in the appointed place, and the spelt in its border?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For his God instructs him aright, [and] teaches him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the fitches are not threshed with a sharp [threshing] instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about on the cumin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cumin with a rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Bread [grain] is ground; for he will not always be threshing it: and though the wheel of his cart and his horses scatter it, he does not grind it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>This also comes forth from Yahweh of hosts, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
