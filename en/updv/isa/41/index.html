He gives nations before him, and makes him rule over kings; he gives them as the dust to his sword, as the driven stubble to his bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He pursues them, and passes on safely, even by a way that he had not gone with his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who has wrought and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I, Yahweh, the first, and with the last, I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The isles have seen, and fear; the ends of the earth tremble; they draw near, and come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>A man helps his fellow man; and says to his brother, Be of good courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the carpenter encourages the goldsmith, [and] he who smoothes with the hammer him who strikes the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good; and he fastens it with nails, that it should not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you, Israel, my slave, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>you whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and called from its corners, and said to you, You are my slave, I have chosen you and not cast you away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Don't be afraid, for I am with you; don't be dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Look, all those who are incensed against you will be put to shame and confounded: those who strive with you will be as nothing, and will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You will seek them, and will not find them, even those who contend with you: those who war against you will be as nothing, and as a thing of nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I, Yahweh your God, will hold your right hand, saying to you, Don't be afraid; I will help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Don't be afraid, you worm Jacob, and you{+} vermin Israel; I will help you, says Yahweh, and your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Look, I have made you [to be] a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; you will thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and will make the hills as chaff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You will winnow them, and the wind will carry them away, and the whirlwind will scatter them; and you will rejoice in Yahweh, you will glory in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst; I, Yahweh, will answer them, I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will put in the wilderness the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the oil-tree; I will set in the desert the fir-tree, the pine, and the box-tree together:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Yahweh has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Produce your{+} cause, says Yahweh; bring forth your{+} strong reasons, says the King of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let them bring forth, and declare to us what will happen: declare{+} the former things, what they are, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or show us things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Declare the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you{+} are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed and watch it together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Look, you{+} are of nothing, and your{+} work is of nothing; he who chooses you{+} is disgusting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have raised up one from the north, and he has come; from the rising of the sun one who calls on my name: and he will trample rulers as mortar, and as the potter treads clay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Who has declared it from the beginning, that we may know?
