For I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live charcoal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Look, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here I am; send me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said, Go, and tell this people, You{+} indeed hear, but don't understand; and you{+} indeed see, but don't perceive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; or else they will see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then I said, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land becomes completely waste,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and Yahweh has removed man far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if there is yet a tenth in it, it also will in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth or as an oak whose stump remains when it is felled; so the holy seed is its stump.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
