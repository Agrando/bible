As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it comes from the wilderness, from a terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A grievous vision is declared to me; the betrayer betrays, and the destroyer destroys. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all her sighing I have made to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore my loins are filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold on me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I can't hear; I am dismayed so that I can't see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart flutters, horror has frightened me; the twilight that I desired has been turned into trembling to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, you{+} princes, anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus has the Lord said to me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he sees:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and when he sees a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of donkeys, a troop of camels, he will listen diligently with much heed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually on the watchtower in the daytime, and am set in my ward whole nights;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and, look, here comes a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O you my threshing, and the grain of my floor! That which I have heard from Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of Dumah. One calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, The morning comes, and also the night: if you{+} will inquire, inquire{+}: turn{+}, come{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden on Arabia. In the forest in Arabia you{+} will lodge, O you{+} caravans of Dedanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>To him who was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema met the fugitives with their bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thus has the Lord said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hired worker, all the glory of Kedar will fail;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the sons of Kedar, will be few; for Yahweh, the God of Israel, has spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
