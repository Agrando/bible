I will gird you, though you haven't known me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides me: I am Yahweh, and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil. I am Yahweh, that does all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Trickle, you{+} heavens, from above, and the skies will pour down righteousness; the earth will open, and salvation will bud and righteousness will spring up together; I, Yahweh, have created it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe to him who strives with his Maker! A potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Will the clay say to him who fashions it, What do you make? Or your work, He has no hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Woe to him who says to a father, What do you beget? Or to a woman, With what do you travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus says Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things that are to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command{+} me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have made the earth, and created man on it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens; and all their host I have commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways: he will build my city, and he will let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, says Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says Yahweh, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you, and they will be yours: they will go after you, in chains they will come over; and they will fall down to you, they will make supplication to you, [saying], Surely God is in you; and there is no other, no [other] God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly you are a God who hides yourself, O God of Israel, the Savior.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They will be put to shame, yes, confounded, all of them; they will go into confusion together who are makers of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>[But] Israel will be saved by Yahweh with an eternal salvation: you{+} will not be put to shame nor confounded forever without end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus says Yahweh who created the heavens, the God who formed the earth and made it, who established it and did not create it a waste, who formed it to be inhabited: I am Yahweh; and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I haven't spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I didn't say to the seed of Jacob, Seek{+} me in vain: I, Yahweh, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, you{+} who have escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray to a god that can't save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Declare{+}, and bring [it] forth; yes, let them take counsel together: who has shown this from ancient time? Who has declared it of old? Haven't I, Yahweh? And there is no other God besides me, a just God and a Savior; there is none besides me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Look to me, and be{+} saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By myself I have sworn, the word has gone forth from my mouth [in] righteousness, and will not return, that to me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Only in Yahweh, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength. One will come to him; and all those who were incensed against him will be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In Yahweh will all the seed of Israel be justified, and will glory.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
