They will be shepherded in the ways, and on all bare heights will be their pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They will not hunger nor thirst; neither will the heat nor sun strike them: for he who has mercy on them will lead them, even by springs of water he will guide them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Look, these will come from far; and, look, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Syene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for Yahweh has comforted his people, and will have compassion on his afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Zion said, Yahweh has forsaken me, and the Lord has forgotten me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yes, these may forget, yet I will not forget you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Look, I have graven you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your builders hurry more than your destroyers, and those who made you waste will go forth from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Lift up your eyes round about, and look at all these who gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, says Yahweh, you will surely clothe yourself with them all as with an ornament, and gird yourself with them, like a bride.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For, as for your waste and your desolate places, and your land that has been destroyed, surely now you will be too strait for the inhabitants, and those who swallowed you up will be far away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sons of your bereavement will yet say in your ears, The place is too strait for me; give a place to me that I may dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then you will say in your heart, Who has begotten me these, seeing I have been bereaved of my children, and am solitary, an exile, and wandering to and fro? And who has brought these up? Look, I was left alone; these, where were they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and set up my ensign to the peoples; and they will bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters will be carried on their shoulders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And kings will be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they will bow down to you with their faces to the earth, and lick the dust of your feet; and you will know that I am Yahweh; and those who wait for me will not be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Will the prey be taken from the mighty, or the captives of a tyrant be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thus says Yahweh, Even the captives of the mighty will be taken away, and the prey of the terrible will be delivered; for I will contend with him who contends with you, and I will save your sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will feed those who oppress you with their own flesh; and they will be drunk with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh will know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior, and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
