[Why] have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge? Look, in the day of your{+} fast you{+} find [your{+} own] pleasure, and exact all your{+} labors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Look, you{+} fast for strife and contention, and to strike with the fist of wickedness: you{+} do not fast this day so as to make your{+} voice to be heard on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is such the fast that I have chosen? The day for man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? Will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Isn't this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you{+} break every yoke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor who are cast out to your house? When you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you don't hide yourself from your own flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then will your light break forth as the morning, and your healing will spring forth speedily; and your righteousness will go before you; the glory of Yahweh will be your rearward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then you will call, and Yahweh will answer; you will cry, and he will say, Here I am. If you take away from the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then your light will rise in darkness, and your obscurity be as the noonday;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and Yahweh will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in dry places, and make your bones strong; and you will be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And those who will be of you will build the old waste places; you will raise up the foundations of many generations; and you will be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, [and] the holy of Yahweh honorable; and will honor it, not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure, nor speaking [your own] words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then you will delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will make you to ride on the high places of the earth; and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father: for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
