And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all its goodliness is as the flower of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The grass withers, the flower fades, because the breath of Yahweh blows on it; surely the people are grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The grass withers, the flower fades; but the word of our God will stand forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>O you who tell good news to Zion, get yourself up on a high mountain; O you who tell good news to Jerusalem, lift up your voice with strength; lift it up, don't be afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Look, your{+} God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Look, the Sovereign Yahweh will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Look, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Like a shepherd, he will shepherd his flock; he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom; [and] will gently lead those that have their young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has directed the Spirit of Yahweh, or being his counselor has taught him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>With whom did he take counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Look, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: Look, he takes up the isles as a very little thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor its beasts sufficient for a burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To whom then will you{+} liken God? Or what likeness will you{+} compare to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The image, a workman has cast [it], and the goldsmith overlays it with gold, and casts [for it] silver chains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He who is too impoverished for [such] an oblation chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks to him a skillful workman to set up a graven image, that will not be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Have you{+} not known? Have you{+} not heard? Has it not been told to you{+} from the beginning? Have you{+} not understood from the foundations of the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[It is] he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are as grasshoppers; who stretches out the heavens as a curtain, and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who brings princes to nothing; who makes the judges of the earth as vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, they have not been planted; yes, they have not been sown; yes, their stock has not taken root in the earth: moreover he blows on them, and they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>To whom then will you{+} liken me, that I should be equal [to him]? says the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Lift up your{+} eyes on high, and see who has created these, that brings out their host by number; he calls them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, My way is hid from Yahweh, and the justice [due] to me has passed away from my God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Haven't you known? Haven't you heard? The everlasting God, Yahweh, the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He gives power to the faint; and to him who has no might he increases strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even the youths will faint and be weary, and the young men will completely fall:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but those who wait for Yahweh will renew their strength; they will mount up with wings as eagles; they will run, and not be weary; they will walk, and not faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
