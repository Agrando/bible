They have forsaken Yahweh, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Why will you{+} be still stricken, that you{+} revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they haven't been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your{+} country is desolate; your{+} cities are burned with fire; your{+} land, strangers devour it in your{+} presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Except Yahweh of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Hear the word of Yahweh, you{+} rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you{+} people of Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What to me is the multitude of your{+} sacrifices? says Yahweh: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I do not delight in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When you{+} come to see my face, who has required this at your{+} hand, to trample my courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is disgusting to me; new moon and Sabbath, the calling of assemblies--I can't endure evil and the solemn meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your{+} new moons and your{+} appointed feasts my soul hates; they are a trouble to me; I am weary of bearing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when you{+} spread forth your{+} hands, I will hide my eyes from you{+}; yes, when you{+} make many prayers, I will not hear: your{+} hands are full of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your{+} doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>learn to do well; seek justice, correct oppression, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Come now, and let us reason together, says Yahweh: though your{+} sins be as scarlet, they will be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they will be as wool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If you{+} are willing and obedient, you{+} will eat the good of the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but if you{+} refuse and rebel, you{+} will be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How has the faithful city become a prostitute! She that was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your princes are rebellious, and partners of thieves; everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards: they do not judge the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease myself of my adversaries, and avenge myself of my enemies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I will turn my hand on you, and thoroughly purge away your dross, and will take away all your tin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning: afterward you will be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Zion will be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But the destruction of transgressors and sinners will be together, and those who forsake Yahweh will be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they will be ashamed of the oaks which you{+} have desired, and you{+} will be confounded for the gardens that you{+} have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For you{+} will be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the strong will be as flax, and his work as a spark; and they will both burn together, and none will quench them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
