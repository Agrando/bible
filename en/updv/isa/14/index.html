The arrogance has ceased!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yahweh has broken the staff of the wicked, the scepter of the rulers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that struck the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, that ruled the nations in anger with a persecution that none restrained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The whole earth is at rest, [and] is quiet: they break forth into singing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yes, the fir-trees rejoice at you, [and] the cedars of Lebanon, [saying], Since you are laid low, no hewer has come up against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Sheol from beneath is moved for you to meet you at your coming; it stirs up the spirits of the dead for you, even all the chief ones of the earth; it has raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They will all answer and say to you, Have you also become weak as we? Have you become like us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, [and] the noise of your viols: the worm is spread under you, and worms cover you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How you have fallen from heaven, O day-star, son of the morning! How you are cut down to the ground, that laid low the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you said in your heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; and I will sit on the mount of congregation, in the uttermost parts of the north;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Yet you will be brought down to Sheol, to the uttermost parts of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Those who see you will gaze at you, they will consider you, [saying], Is this the man who made the earth to tremble, that shook kingdoms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that made the world as a wilderness, and overthrew its cities; that did not let loose his prisoners to their home?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>All the kings of the nations, all of them, sleep in glory, every one in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But you are cast forth away from your tomb like a disgusting branch, clothed with the slain, who are thrust through with the sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a dead body trodden under foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You will not be joined with them in burial, because you have destroyed your land, you have slain your people; the seed of evildoers will not be named forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Prepare{+} slaughter for his sons for the iniquity of their fathers, that they do not rise up, and possess the earth, and fill the face of the world with cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will rise up against them, says Yahweh of hosts, and cut off from Babylon name and remnant, and son and son's son, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will also make it a possession for the porcupine, and pools of water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, says Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yahweh of hosts has sworn, saying, Surely, as I have thought, so it will come to pass; and as I have purposed, so it will stand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my mountains tread him under foot: then will his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>This is the purpose that is purposed on the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out on all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For Yahweh of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it?
