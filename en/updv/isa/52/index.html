Those who rule over them howl, says Yahweh, and my name is blasphemed continually all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore my people will know my name: therefore [they will know] in that day that I am he who speaks; look, it is I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good [things], who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, Your God reigns!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The voice of your watchmen! They lift up the voice, together they sing; for they will see eye to eye, when Yahweh returns to Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Break forth into joy, sing together, you{+} waste places of Jerusalem; for Yahweh has comforted his people, he has redeemed Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yahweh has made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Depart{+}, depart{+}, go{+} out from there, touch no unclean thing; go{+} out of the midst of her; cleanse yourselves, you{+} who bear the vessels of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For you{+} will not go out in a hurry, neither will you{+} go by flight: for Yahweh will go before you{+}; and the God of Israel will be your{+} rearward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Look, my slave will deal wisely, he will be exalted and lifted up, and will be very high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Just as many were astonished at you, so [is his] anointing more than a man, his appearance and form more than sons of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So he will sprinkle many nations; kings will shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told to them they will see; and that which they had not heard they will understand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
