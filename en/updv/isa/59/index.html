And Yahweh saw it, and it was evil in his eyes that there was no justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation to him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation on his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the islands he will repay recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they will fear the name of Yahweh from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And a Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh: my Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth, will not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed, says Yahweh, from now on and forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
