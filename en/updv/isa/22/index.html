What ails you now, that you are wholly gone up to the housetops?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>O you who are full of shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; your slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>All your rulers fled away together, they were bound by the archers; all who were found of you were bound together; they fled far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore I said, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; don't labor to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it is a day of discomfiture, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Elam bore the quiver, with chariots of man [and] horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass, that your choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took away the covering of Judah; and you looked in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And you{+} saw the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and you{+} gathered together the waters of the lower pool;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and you{+} numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and you{+} broke down the houses to fortify the wall;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>you{+} also made a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool. But you{+} didn't look to him who had done this, neither had you{+} respect to him who purposed it long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in that day the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, called to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but saw joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Yahweh of hosts revealed himself in my ears, Surely this iniquity will not be forgiven you{+} until you{+} die, says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, Go, get yourself to this treasurer, even to Shebna, who is over the house, [and say],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>What do you have here? And whom do you have here, that you have hewed yourself out here a tomb? Hewing himself out a tomb on high, graving a habitation for himself in the rock!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Look, Yahweh will hurl you away violently, O [prominent] man, and he will wrap you up closely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He will surely wind you round and round, [and toss you] like a ball into a large country; there you will die, and there will be the chariots of your glory, you shame of your lord's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will thrust you from your office; and from your station he will pull you down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it will come to pass in that day, that I will call my slave Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I will clothe him with your robe, and strengthen him with your belt, and I will commit your government into his hand; and he will be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the key of the house of David I will lay on his shoulder; and he will open, and none will shut; and he will shut, and none will open.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he will be for a throne of glory to his father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they will hang on him all the glory of his father's house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the flagons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>In that day, says Yahweh of hosts, will the nail that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it will be cut down, and fall; and the burden that was on it will be cut off; for Yahweh has spoken it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
