Add{+} year to year; let the feasts come round:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation; and she will be to me as Ariel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will encamp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And you will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground, and your speech will be low out of the dust; and your voice will be as a spirit out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But the multitude of your strangers will be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passes away: yes, it will be suddenly in an instant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>She will be visited of Yahweh of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, will be as a dream, a vision of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it will be as when a hungry man dreams, and, look, he eats; but he awakes, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, look, he drinks; but he awakes, and, look, he is faint, and his soul has appetite: so will the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Tarry{+} and wonder; take your{+} pleasure and be blind: they are drunk, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Yahweh has poured out on you{+} the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your{+} eyes, the prophets; and your{+} heads, the seers, he has covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all vision has become to you{+} as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you; and he says, I can't, for it is sealed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the book is delivered to him who is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray you; and he says, I am not learned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Lord said, Since this people draw near [to me], and with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught [to them];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore, look, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to those who hide deep their counsel from Yahweh, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who sees us? And who knows us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You{+} turn things upside down! Will the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him who made it, He didn't make me; or the thing formed say of him who formed it, He has no understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be esteemed as a forest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The meek also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among man will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who watch for iniquity are cut off;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who make man an offender in [his] cause, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob will not now be ashamed, neither will his face now wax pale.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name; yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They also that err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who murmur will receive instruction.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
