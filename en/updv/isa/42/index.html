These things I will do, and I will not forsake them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They will be turned back, they will be completely put to shame, who trust in graven images, who say to molten images, You{+} are our gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Hear, you{+} deaf; and look, you{+} blind, that you{+} may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who is blind, but my slave?

Who is blind as he who is at peace [with me], and blind as Yahweh's slave?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You have seen many things, but you don't retain; his ears are open, but he doesn't hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It pleased Yahweh, for his righteousness' sake, to magnify the law, and make it honorable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But this is a people robbed and plundered; all of them are snared in holes, and they are hid in prison-houses: they are for a prey, and none delivers; for a spoil, and none says, Restore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who is there among you{+} who will give ear to this? Who will listen and hear for the time to come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Did not Yahweh? He against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient to his law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he poured on him the fierceness of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he didn't know; and it burned him, yet he didn't lay it to heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
