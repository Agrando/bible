Through the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches on the shoulders of young donkeys, and their treasures on the humps of camels, to a people who will not profit [them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose: therefore I have called her Rahab that sits still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it in a book, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is a rebellious people, lying sons, sons who will not hear the law of Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>that say to the seers, Don't see; and to the prophets, Don't prophesy to us right things, speak to us smooth things, prophesy deceits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>get{+} out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because you{+} despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>therefore this iniquity will be to you{+} as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing; so that there will not be found among its pieces a sherd with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cistern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For thus said the Sovereign Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, In returning and rest you{+} will be saved; in quietness and in confidence will be your{+} strength. And you{+} would not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but you{+} said, No, for we will flee on horses; therefore you{+} will flee: and, We will ride on the swift; therefore those who pursue you{+} will be swift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>A thousand together [will flee] at the threat of one; at the threat of five you{+} will flee: until you{+} are left as a beacon on the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And therefore Yahweh will wait, that he may be gracious to you{+}; and therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy on you{+}: for Yahweh is a God of justice; blessed are all those who wait for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the people will dwell in Zion at Jerusalem; you will weep no more; he will surely be gracious to you at the voice of your cry; when he will hear, he will answer you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And though the Lord gives you{+} the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet your teachers will not be hidden anymore, but your eyes will see your teachers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, This is the way, walk{+} in it; when you{+} turn to the right hand, and when you{+} turn to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you{+} will defile the overlaying of your graven images of silver, and the plating of your molten images of gold: you will cast them away as a menstrual cloth; you will say to it, Get away from here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he will give the rain for your seed, with which you will sow the ground; and bread of the increase of the ground, and it will be fat and plenteous.
