But a grievous word stirs up anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The tongue of the wise utters knowledge aright; But the mouth of fools gushes out folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The eyes of Yahweh are in every place, Keeping watch on the evil and the good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A gentle tongue is a tree of life; But perverseness in it is a breaking of the spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A fool despises his father's correction; But he who regards reproof gets prudence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In the house of the righteous is much treasure; But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The lips of the wise disperse knowledge; But the heart of the foolish is not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The sacrifice of the wicked is disgusting to Yahweh; But the prayer of the upright is his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The way of the wicked is disgusting to Yahweh; But he loves him who follows after righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There is grievous correction for him who forsakes the way; [And] he who hates reproof will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Sheol and Abaddon are before Yahweh: How much more then the hearts of the sons of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A scoffer does not love to be reproved; He will not go to the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>A glad heart makes a cheerful countenance; But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The heart of him who has understanding seeks knowledge; But the mouth of fools feeds on folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All the days of the afflicted are evil; But he who is of a cheerful heart [has] a continual feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Better is little, with the fear of Yahweh, Than great treasure and trouble with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Better is a dinner of herbs, where there is love, Than a stalled ox and hatred with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A wrathful man stirs up contention; But he who is slow to anger appeases strife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of the sluggard is as a hedge of thorns; But the path of the upright is made a highway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A wise son makes a glad father; But [a] foolish man despises his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Folly is joy to him who is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding makes straight his going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Where there is no counsel, purposes are disappointed; But in the multitude of counselors they are established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>A man has joy in the answer of his mouth; And a word in due season, how good it is!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>To the wise the way of life [goes] upward, That he may depart from Sheol beneath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yahweh will root up the house of the proud; But he will establish the border of the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Evil devices are disgusting to Yahweh; But pleasant words [are] pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who is greedy of gain troubles his own house; But he who hates bribes will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The heart of the righteous studies to answer; But the mouth of the wicked gushes out evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yahweh is far from the wicked; But he hears the prayer of the righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The light of the eyes rejoices the heart; [And] good news make the bones fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The ear that harkens to the reproof of life Will reside among the wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He who refuses correction despises his own soul; But he who harkens to reproof gets understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The fear of Yahweh is the instruction of wisdom; And before honor [goes] humility.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
