But a just weight is his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>When pride comes, then comes shame; But with the lowly is wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The integrity of the upright will guide them; But the perverseness of betrayers will destroy them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Riches do not profit in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivers from death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The righteousness of the perfect will direct his way; But the wicked will fall by his own wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The righteousness of the upright will deliver them; But betrayers will be taken in their own iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When [a] wicked man dies, [his] expectation will perish; And the hope of iniquity perishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The righteous is delivered out of trouble, And the wicked comes in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With his mouth the godless man destroys his fellow man; But through knowledge will the righteous be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices; And when the wicked perish, there is shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who despises his fellow man is void of wisdom; But a man of understanding holds his peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He who goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets; But he who is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Where there is no wise guidance, a people falls; But in the multitude of counselors there is safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He who is surety for a stranger will smart for it; But he who hates suretyship is secure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A gracious woman obtains honor; And violent men obtain riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The merciful man does good to his own soul; But he who is cruel troubles his own flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The wicked earns deceitful wages; But he who sows righteousness [has] a sure reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He who is steadfast in righteousness, to life; And he who pursues evil, to his death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Those who are perverse in heart are disgusting to Yahweh; But such as are perfect in [their] way are his delight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>[Though] hand [join] in hand, the evil man will not be unpunished; But the seed of the righteous will be delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[As] a ring of gold in a swine's snout, [So is] a beautiful woman who is without discretion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The desire of the righteous is only good; [But] the expectation of the wicked is wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is one who scatters, and increases yet more; And there is one who withholds more than is meet, but [tends] only to want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The liberal soul will be made fat; And he who waters will be watered also himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He who withholds grain, the people will curse him; But blessing will be on the head of him who sells it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He who diligently seeks good seeks favor; But he who searches after evil, it will come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He who trusts in his riches will fall; But the righteous will flourish as the green leaf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind; And the foolish will be slave to the wise of heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he who is wise wins souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Look, the righteous will be recompensed in the earth: How much more the wicked and the sinner!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
