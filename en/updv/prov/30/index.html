The [noble] man says to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Surely I am more brutish than any man, And don't have the understanding of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I have not learned wisdom, Neither have I knowledge of the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who has ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has bound the waters in his garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you know?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Every word of God is tried: He is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Don't add to his words, Or else he will reprove you, and you will be found a liar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Two things I have asked of you; Don't deny me [them] before I die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Remove far from me falsehood and lies; Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is needful for me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or else I will be full, and deny [you], and say, Who is Yahweh? Or else I will be poor, and steal, And profanely use the name of my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Don't slander a slave to his master, Or else he will curse you, and you will be held guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is a generation who curse their father, And do not bless their mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is a generation who are pure in their own eyes, And [yet] are not washed from their filthiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>There is a generation whose teeth are [as] swords, and their jaw teeth [as] knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The horseleach has two daughters, [crying] Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, [Yes], four that don't say, Enough:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Sheol; and the barren womb; The earth that is not satisfied with water; And the fire that does not say, Enough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The eye that mocks at his father, And despises to obey his mother, The ravens of the valley will pick it out, And the young eagles will eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Yes, four which I don't know:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The way of an eagle in the air; The way of a serpent on a rock; The way of a ship in the midst of the sea; And the way of a [noble] man with a young woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So is the way of an adulterous woman; She eats, and wipes her mouth, And says, I have done no wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For three things the earth trembles, And for four, [which] it can't bear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a slave when he is king; And a fool when he is filled with food;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For an odious woman when she is married; And a female slave when she takes the place of her mistress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There are four things which are little on the earth, But they are exceedingly wise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The ants are not a strong people, Yet they provide their food in the summer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The conies are but a feeble folk, Yet make they their houses in the rocks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The locusts have no king, Yet go they forth all of them by bands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The lizard, you can catch it with [your] hands, Yet is she in kings' palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There are three things which are stately in their march, Yes, four which are stately in going:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, And does not turn away for any;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The greyhound; the he-goat also; And the king against whom there is no rising up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, Or if you have thought evil, [Lay] your hand on your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the churning of milk brings forth butter, And the wringing of the nose brings forth blood; So the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
