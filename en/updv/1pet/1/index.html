on whom, though now you{+} do not see him, yet believing, you{+} rejoice greatly with joy unspeakable and full of glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>receiving the end of your{+} faith, [even] the salvation of [your{+}] souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Concerning which salvation the prophets sought and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that [should come] to you{+}:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>searching what [time] or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did point to, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glories that should follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you{+}, they were providing these things, which now have been announced to you{+} through those who preached the good news to you{+} by the Holy Spirit sent forth from heaven; which things angels desire to look into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore girding up the loins of your{+} mind, be sober and set your{+} hope perfectly on the grace that is to be brought to you{+} at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as sons of obedience, not fashioning yourselves according to your{+} former desires in [the time of] your{+} ignorance:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but like he who called you{+} is holy, be{+} yourselves also holy in all manner of living;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because it is written, You{+} will be holy; for I am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if you{+} call on him as Father, who without respect of persons judges according to each man's work, pass the time of your{+} sojourning in fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>knowing that you{+} were redeemed from your{+} useless manner of life handed down from your{+} fathers, not with corruptible things, silver or gold;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, [even the blood] of Christ:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who was foreknown indeed before the foundation of the world, but was manifested at the end of times for your{+} sake,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who through him are believers in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; so that your{+} faith and hope might be in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Seeing you{+} have purified your{+} souls in your{+} obedience to the truth to unfeigned love of the brothers, love one another fervently from a pure heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>having been begotten again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the word of God, which lives and stays.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For, All flesh is as grass, And all its glory as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the word of the Lord stays forever. And this is the word of good news which was preached to you{+}.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
