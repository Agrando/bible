You{+} became her children--doing good and not being put in fear by any terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You{+} husbands, in like manner, dwell with [your{+} wives] according to knowledge, giving honor to the woman, as to the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your{+} prayers not be hindered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Finally, all of you{+} [be] likeminded, compassionate, loving as brothers, tenderhearted, humbleminded:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but on the contrary blessing; for hereunto were you{+} called, that you{+} should inherit a blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, He who would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, And his ears to their supplication: But the face of the Lord is on those who do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And who is he that will harm you{+}, if you{+} are zealous of that which is good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But even if you{+} should suffer for righteousness' sake, blessed [are you{+}:] and don't be afraid of their fear, neither be troubled;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but sanctify in your{+} hearts the Lord Christ: [being] ready always to give answer to every man who asks you{+} a reason concerning the hope that is in you{+},</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>yet with meekness and fear, having a good conscience; that, in what you{+} are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your{+} good manner of life in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that you{+} suffer for doing good than for doing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring you{+} to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who previously were disobedient, when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>which also after a true likeness does now save you{+}, [even] baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
