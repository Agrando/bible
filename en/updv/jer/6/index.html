Woe to us! For the day declines, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus has Yahweh of hosts said, Cut{+} down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As a well casts forth its waters, so she casts forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Be instructed, O Jerusalem, or else my soul will be alienated from you; and I will make you a desolation, a land not inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus says Yahweh of hosts, They will thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again your hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? Look, their ear is uncircumcised, and they can't listen: look, the word of Yahweh has become to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I am full of the wrath of Yahweh; I am weary with holding in: pour it out on the children in the street, and on the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife will be taken, the aged with him who is full of days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their houses will be turned to others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For from the least of them even to the greatest of them everyone is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest everyone deals falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They were ashamed when they did these disgusting things. But, they did not feel ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they will fall among those who fall; at the time that I visit them they will be cast down, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says Yahweh, Stand{+} in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk in it, and you{+} will find rest for your{+} souls: but they said, We will not walk [in it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I set watchmen over you{+}, [saying], Listen to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore hear, you{+} nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Hear, O earth: look, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>To what purpose does frankincense from Sheba come to me, and the sweet cane from a far country? Your{+} burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your{+} sacrifices pleasing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh, Look, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together will stumble against them; the neighbor and his fellow man will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says Yahweh, Look, a people comes from the north country; and a great nation will be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea, and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, O daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>We have heard its report; our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Don't go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, [and] terror, are on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>O daughter of my people, gird with sackcloth, and wallow in ashes: make mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer will suddenly come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Among my people, I have made you as a trier [of metals], as a fortress you will examine and try their way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All of them are grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are bronze and iron: all of them, they deal corruptly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Men will call them refuse silver, because Yahweh has rejected them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
