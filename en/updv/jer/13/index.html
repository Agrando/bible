Will not sorrows take hold of you, as of a woman in travail?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And if you say in your heart, Why have these things come upon me? For the greatness of your iniquity are your skirts uncovered, and your heels suffer violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? Then may you{+} also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I will scatter them, as the stubble that passes away, by the wind of the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This is your lot, the portion measured to you from me, says Yahweh; because you have forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I will also uncover your skirts on your face, and your shame will appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I have seen your detestable things, even your adulteries, and your neighings, the lewdness of your prostitution, on the hills in the field. Woe to you, O Jerusalem! You will not be made clean; how much longer will it be?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
