Why are total betrayers at ease?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You have planted them, yes, they have taken root; they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit: you are near in their mouth, and far from their heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But you, O Yahweh, know me; you see me, and try my heart toward you: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>How long will the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? For the wickedness of those who dwell in it, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He will not see our latter end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses? And though in a land of peace you are secure, yet how will you do in the pride of the Jordan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For even your brothers, and the house of your father, even they have betrayed you; even they have cried aloud after you: don't believe them, though they speak fair words to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>My heritage has become to me as a lion in the forest: she has uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is my heritage to me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about? Go{+}, assemble{+} all the beasts of the field, bring{+} them to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They have made it a desolation; it mourns to me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man lays it to heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Destroyers have come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness; for the sword of Yahweh devours from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh has peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have tired themselves out, and profit nothing. And be{+} ashamed of your{+} fruits, because of the fierce anger of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says Yahweh against all my evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: look, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it will come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it will come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As Yahweh lives; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then they will be built up in the midst of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if they will not hear, then I will pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, says Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
