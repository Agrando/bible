and they will empty her land: for in the day of trouble they will be against her round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Against [him who] bends let the archer bend his bow, and against [him who] lifts himself up in his coat of mail: and don't spare{+} her young men; destroy{+} completely all her host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they will fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans, and thrust through in her streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Yahweh of hosts; though their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life; don't be cut off in her iniquity: for it is the time of Yahweh's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh's hand, that made all the earth drunk: the nations have drank of her wine; therefore the nations are mad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Babylon has suddenly fallen and destroyed: wail for her; take balm for her pain, if perhaps she may be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yahweh has brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields: Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it: for it is the vengeance of Yahweh, the vengeance of his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O you who stay on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end has come, the measure of your covetousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yahweh of hosts has sworn by himself, [saying], Surely I will fill you with man, as with the cankerworm; and they will lift up a shout against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he has stretched out the heavens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Everyone among man has become brutish [and is] without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things, and the rod of his inheritance: Yahweh of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You are my battle-ax and weapons of war: and with you I will break in pieces the nations; and with you I will destroy kingdoms;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and with you I will break in pieces the horse and his rider;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and with you I will break in pieces the chariot and him who rides in it; and with you I will break in pieces man and woman; and with you I will break in pieces the old man and the youth; and with you I will break in pieces the young man and the virgin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and with you I will break in pieces the shepherd and his flock; and with you I will break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke [of oxen]; and with you I will break in pieces governors and deputies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your{+} sight, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Look, I am against you, O destroying mountain, says Yahweh, which destroys all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you a burnt mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they will not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but you will be desolate forever, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Set{+} up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz: appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough cankerworm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes, their governors, and all their deputies, and all the land of their dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the land trembles and is in pain; for the purposes of Yahweh against Babylon stand, to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they remain in their strongholds; their might has failed; they have become as women: her dwelling-places are set on fire; her bars are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>One post will run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on every quarter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are frightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor at the time when it is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest will come for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has, like a monster, swallowed me up, he has filled his maw with my delicacies; he has cast me out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon, will the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea, will Jerusalem say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh: Look, I will plead your cause, and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea, and make her fountain dry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Babylon will become heaps, a dwelling-place for jackals, an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>They will roar together like young lions; they will growl as lions' whelps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make them drunk, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not awaken, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>How is Sheshach taken! And the praise of the whole earth seized! How has Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The sea has come up on Babylon; she's covered with the multitude of its waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Her cities have become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert, a land in which no man dwells, neither does any son of man pass by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up; and the nations will not flow anymore to him: yes, the wall of Babylon will fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>My people, go{+} out of the midst of her, and save yourselves every man from the fierce anger of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Or else your{+} heart will be faint, and you{+} will fear for the news that will be heard in the land; for news will come one year, and after that in another year [will come] news, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore, look, the days come, that I will execute judgment on the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land will be confounded; and all her slain will fall in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is in them, will sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers will come to her from the north, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon will fall the slain of all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>You{+} who have escaped the sword, go{+}, don't stand still; remember Yahweh from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your{+} mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion has covered our faces: for strangers have come into the sanctuaries of Yahweh's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Therefore, look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will execute judgment on her graven images; and through all her land the wounded will groan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me will destroyers come to her, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For Yahweh lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of her the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters; the noise of their voice is uttered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>for the destroyer has come upon her, even on Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces; for Yahweh is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they will sleep a perpetual sleep, and not awaken, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon will be completely overthrown, and her high gates will be burned with fire; and the peoples will labor for vanity, and the nations for the fire; and they will be weary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, then see that you read all these words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>and say, O Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut it off, that none will dwell in it, neither man nor beast, but that it will be desolate forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And it will be, when you have made an end of reading this book, that you will bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and you will say, Thus will Babylon sink, and will not rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her; (and they will be weary). Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
