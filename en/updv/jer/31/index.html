Is he a darling child? For as often as I speak against him, I earnestly remember him still: therefore my insides yearn for him; I will surely have mercy on him, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Set up waymarks, make guideposts; set your heart toward the highway, even the way by which you went: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these cities of yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>How long will you go here and there, O you backsliding daughter? For Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth: a woman will encircle an [able-bodied] man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, Yet again they will use this speech in the land of Judah and in its cities, when I will bring again their captivity: Yahweh bless you, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Judah and all its cities will dwell in it together, the husbandmen, and [those who] go about with flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul I have replenished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On this I awakened, and looked; and my sleep was sweet to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it will come to pass that, like I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In those days they will say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the sons are set on edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But every one will die for his own iniquity: any among man who eats the sour grapes, his teeth will be set on edge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which covenant of mine they broke, although I was a husband to them, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says Yahweh: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they will be my people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and they will teach no more every man his fellow man, and every man his brother, saying, Know Yahweh; for they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Yahweh: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirs up the sea, so that its waves roar; Yahweh of hosts is his name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If these ordinances depart from before me, says Yahweh, then the seed of Israel also will cease from being a nation before me forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus says Yahweh: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Look, the days come, says Yahweh, that the city will be built to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the measuring line will go out further straight onward to the hill Gareb, and will turn about to Goah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner of the horse gate toward the east, will be holy to Yahweh; it will not be plucked up, nor thrown down anymore forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
