For I will cause the captivity of the land to return as at the first, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Yet again there will be in this place, which is waste, without man and without beast, and in all its cities, a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, will the flocks again pass under the hands of him who numbers them, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will perform that good word which I have spoken concerning the house of Israel and concerning the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In those days, and at that time, I will cause a Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he will execute justice and righteousness in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In those days Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will stay safely; and this is what she will be called: Yahweh our righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thus says Yahweh: David will not lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>neither will the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings, and to sacrifice continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Thus says Yahweh: If you{+} can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there will not be day and night in their season;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>then may also my covenant be broken with David my slave, that he will not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>As the host of heaven can't be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured; so I will multiply the seed of David my slave, and the Levites that minister to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Have you not considered what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which Yahweh chose, he has cast them off? Thus they despise my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus says Yahweh: If [there is] not my covenant of day and night, if I haven't appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>then I will also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of David my slave, so that I will not take of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and will have mercy on them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
