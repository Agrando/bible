Yet you, O Yahweh, are in the midst of us, and we are called by your name; don't leave us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says Yahweh to this people, Even so they have loved to wander; they haven't refrained their feet: therefore Yahweh does not accept them; now he will remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Yahweh said to me, Don't pray for this people for [their] good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and meal-offering, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I said, Ah, Sovereign Yahweh! Look, the prophets say to them, You{+} will not see the sword, neither will you{+} have famine; but I will give you{+} assured peace in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Yahweh said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name; I did not send them, neither have I commanded them, neither did I speak to them: they prophesy to you{+} a lying vision, and a psychic reading, and a thing of nothing, and the deceit of their own heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I did not send them, yet they say, Sword and famine will not be in this land: By sword and famine will those prophets be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people to whom they prophesy will be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they will have none to bury them--them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you will say this word to them, Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and don't let them cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>If I go forth into the field, then, look, the slain with the sword! And if I enter into the city, then, look, those who are sick with famine! For both the prophet and the priest go about in the land, and have no knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have you completely rejected Judah? Has your soul loathed Zion? Why have you struck us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and, look, dismay!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>We acknowledge, O Yahweh, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Do not abhor [us], for your name's sake; do not shame the throne of your glory: remember, don't break your covenant with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can cause rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Are you not he, O Yahweh our God? Therefore we will wait for you; for you have made all these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
