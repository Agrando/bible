for we are left but a few of many, as your eyes see us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>that Yahweh your God may show us the way in which we should walk, and the thing that we should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you{+}; look, I will pray to Yahweh your{+} God according to your{+} words; and it will come to pass that whatever thing Yahweh will answer you{+}, I will declare it to you{+}; I will keep nothing back from you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then they said to Jeremiah, Yahweh be a true and faithful witness among us, if we do not do according to all the word with which Yahweh your God will send you to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whether it is good, or whether it is evil, we will obey the voice of Yahweh our God, to whom we send you; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and said to them, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, to whom you{+} sent me to present your{+} supplication before him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If you{+} will still remain in this land, then I will build you{+}, and not pull you{+} down, and I will plant you{+}, and not pluck you{+} up; for I repent of the evil that I have done to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Don't be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom you{+} are afraid; don't be afraid of him, says Yahweh: for I am with you{+} to save you{+}, and to deliver you{+} from his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will grant you{+} mercy, that he may have mercy on you{+}, and he will let you{+} return to your{+} own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But if you{+} say, We will not dwell in this land; so that you{+} do not obey the voice of Yahweh your{+} God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we will see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there we will dwell:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>now therefore hear{+} the word of Yahweh, O remnant of Judah: Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, If you{+} indeed set your{+} faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then it will come to pass, that the sword, which you{+} fear, will overtake you{+} there in the land of Egypt; and the famine, of which you{+} are afraid, will stick [closely] after you{+} there in Egypt; and there you{+} will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So it will be with all the men who set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there: they will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them will remain or escape from the evil that I will bring on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: As my anger and my wrath has been poured forth on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will my wrath be poured forth on you{+}, when you{+} will enter into Egypt; and you{+} will be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and you{+} will see this place no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yahweh has spoken concerning you{+}, O remnant of Judah, Don't go{+} into Egypt: know certainly that I have testified to you{+} this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you{+} have dealt deceitfully against your{+} own souls; for you{+} sent me to Yahweh your{+} God, saying, Pray for us to Yahweh our God; and according to all that Yahweh our God will say, so declare to us, and we will do it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and I have this day declared it to you{+}; but you{+} haven't obeyed the voice of Yahweh your{+} God in anything for which he has sent me to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore know certainly that you{+} will die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you{+} desire to go to sojourn there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
