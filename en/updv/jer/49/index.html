Thus says Yahweh: Has Israel no sons? Has he no heir? Why then does Milcom possess Gad, and his people dwell in its cities?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Therefore, look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will cause an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the sons of Ammon; and it will become a desolate heap, and her daughters will be burned with fire: then will Israel possess those who possessed him, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you{+} daughters of Rabbah, gird{+} with sackcloth: lament, and run to and fro among the fences; for Milcom will go into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Why do you glory in the valleys, your flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who will come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Look, I will bring a fear on you, says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, from all who are round about you; and you{+} will be driven out every man right forth, and there will be none to gather together the fugitives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the sons of Ammon, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Of Edom. Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Is their wisdom vanished?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee{+}, turn back, dwell in the depths, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I will visit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If grape-gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves by night, would they not destroy until they had enough?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he cannot hide himself: his seed is destroyed, and his brothers, and his neighbors; and he is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let your widows trust in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says Yahweh: Look, they to whom it did not pertain to drink of the cup will assuredly drink; and are you he who will altogether go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but you will surely drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, that Bozrah will become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all its cities will be perpetual wastes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent among the nations, [saying], Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and rise up to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For, look, I have made you small among the nations, and despised among man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for your terribleness, the pride of your heart has deceived you, O you who stay in the clefts of the rock, that hold the height of the hill: though you should make your nest as high as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Edom will become an astonishment: everyone who passes by it will be astonished, and will hiss at all its plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, says Yahweh, a man will not dwell there, neither will any son of man sojourn in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Look, he will come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make him run away from it; and whoever is chosen, I will appoint him over it: for who is like me? And who will appoint me a time? And who is the shepherd that will stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore hear{+} the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely they will drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he will make their habitation desolate over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry, the noise of which is heard in the Red Sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Look, he will come up and fly as the eagle, and spread out his wings against Bozrah: and the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard evil news, they melt [with fear]; on the sea [there is] anxiety, it can't be quiet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Damascus is waxed feeble, she turns herself to flee, and trembling has seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore her young men will fall in her streets, and all the men of war will be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon struck. Thus says Yahweh: Arise{+}, go up to Kedar, and destroy the sons of the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They will take their tents and their flocks; they will carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they will cry to them, Terror on every side!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Flee{+}, wander far off, dwell in the depths, O you{+} inhabitants of Hazor, says Yahweh; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has taken counsel against them, and has conceived a purpose against you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Arise, get{+} up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells without care, says Yahweh. It has neither gates nor bars. They stay alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And their camels will be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter to all winds those who have the corners [of their hair] cut off; and I will bring their calamity from every side of them, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Hazor will be a dwelling-place of jackals, a desolation forever: man will not dwell there, neither will any son of man sojourn in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: Look, I will break the bow of Elam, the chief of their might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And on Elam I will bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there will be no nation where the outcasts of Elam will not come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before those who seek their life; and I will bring evil on them, even my fierce anger, says Yahweh; and I will send the sword after them, until I have consumed them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there king and princes, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But it will come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring back the captivity of Elam, says Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
