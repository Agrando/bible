publish, and do not conceal: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which will make her land desolate, and none will dwell in it: they have fled, they have gone, both man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the sons of Israel will come, they and the sons of Judah together; they will go on their way weeping, and will seek Yahweh their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They will inquire concerning Zion with their faces toward there, [saying], Come{+}, and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting covenant that will not be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>All who found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Yahweh, the habitation of righteousness, even Yahweh, the hope of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, look, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they will set themselves in array against her; from there she will be taken: their arrows will be as a mighty man taking away children, they will not return in vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Chaldea will be a prey: all who prey on her will be satisfied, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because you{+} are glad, because you{+} rejoice, O you{+} who plunder my heritage, because you{+} are wanton as a heifer that treads out [the grain], and neigh as strong horses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>your{+} mother will be completely put to shame; she who bore you{+} will be confounded: look, she will be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Because of the wrath of Yahweh she will not be inhabited, but she will be wholly desolate: everyone who goes by Babylon will be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all you{+} who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she has sinned against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shout against her round about: she has submitted herself; her bulwarks have fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Yahweh: take vengeance on her; as she has done, do to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they will turn every one to his people, and they will flee every one to his own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: Look, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul will be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the iniquity of Israel will be sought for, and there will be none; and the sins of Judah, and they will not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and completely destroy after them, says Yahweh, and do according to all that I have commanded you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken! How has Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, O Babylon, and you were not aware: you are found, and also caught, because you have striven against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yahweh has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Yahweh of hosts, has a work [to do] in the land of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Come against her from the utmost border; open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her completely; let nothing of her be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! For their day has come, the time of their visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, the vengeance of his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none of her escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her; for she has been proud against Yahweh, against the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore will her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Look, I am against you, O you proud one, says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts; for your day has come, the time that I will visit you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the proud one will stumble and fall, and none will raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it will devour all who are round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus says Yahweh of hosts: The sons of Israel and the sons of Judah are oppressed together; and all who took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A sword is on the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants of Babylon, and on her princes, and on her wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>A sword is on the boasters, and they will become fools; a sword is on her mighty men, and they will be dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots, and on all the mingled people who are in the midst of her; and they will become as women: a sword is on her treasures, and they will be robbed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>A drought is on her waters, and they will be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves will dwell there, and the ostriches will dwell in it: and it will be inhabited no more forever; neither will it be stayed in from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring cities, says Yahweh, so a man will not dwell there, neither will any son of man sojourn in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Look, a people comes from the north; and a great nation and many kings will be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, O daughter of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of him, [and] pangs as of a woman in travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Look, [the enemy] will come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, I will appoint him over it: for who is like me? And who will appoint me a time? And who is the shepherd that can stand before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Therefore hear{+} the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they will drag them away, [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he will make their habitation desolate over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles, and the cry is heard among the nations.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
