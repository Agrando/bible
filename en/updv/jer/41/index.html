So he forbare, and did not slay them among their brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the pit in which Ishmael cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain was the cistern of Gedaliah. This was the one that Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those who were slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people who were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people who remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now it came to pass that, when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, then they were glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So all the people who Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, [to wit], the men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought back from Gibeon:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they departed, and dwelt in Geruth Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor over the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
