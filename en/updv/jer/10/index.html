Don't be afraid of them; for they can't do evil, neither is it in them to do good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There is none like you, O Yahweh; you are great, and your name is great in might.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who should not fear you, O King of the nations? For to you does it appertain; since among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! It is but a stock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skillful men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Yahweh is the true God; he is the living God, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembles, and the nations are not able to endure his indignation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus you{+} will say to them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, these will perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he has stretched out the heavens:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings for the rain, and brings forth the wind out of his treasuries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All of man has become brutish [and is] without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they will perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: Yahweh of hosts is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Gather up your wares out of the land, O you who remain in the siege.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For thus says Yahweh, Look, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe is me because of my hurt! My wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is [my] grief, and I must bear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my sons have gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent anymore, and to set up my curtains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the shepherds have become brutish, and haven't inquired of Yahweh: therefore they haven't prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The voice of news, look, it comes, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O Yahweh, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in a man who walks to direct his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>O Yahweh, correct me, but in measure: not in your anger, or else you will bring me to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you, and on the families that do not call on your name: for they have devoured Jacob, yes, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
