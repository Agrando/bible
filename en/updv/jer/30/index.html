For that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he will be saved out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it will come to pass in that day, says Yahweh of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds; and strangers will no more make him their slave;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but they will serve Yahweh their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore don't be afraid, O Jacob my slave, says Yahweh; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, look, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob will return, and will be quiet and at ease, and none will make him afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I am with you, says Yahweh, to save you: for I will make a full end of all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not make a full end of you; but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way leave you unpunished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For thus says Yahweh, Your hurt is incurable, and your wound grievous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All your lovers have forgotten you; they don't seek you: for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins have increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Why do you cry for your hurt? Your pain is incurable: for the greatness of your iniquity, because your sins have increased, I have done these things to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore all those who devour you will be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, will go into captivity; and those who despoil you will be a spoil, and all who prey on you I will give for a prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, says Yahweh; because they have called you an outcast, [saying], It is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus says Yahweh: Look, I will turn again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city will be built on its own hill, and the palace will be inhabited after its own manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And out of them will proceed thanksgiving and the voice of those who make merry: and I will multiply them, and they will not be few; I will also glorify them, and they will not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Their sons also will be as previously, and their congregation will be established before me; and I will punish all who oppress them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their prince will be of themselves, and their ruler will proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he will approach to me: for who is he who has had boldness to approach to me? says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you{+} will be my people, and I will be your{+} God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Look, the tempest of Yahweh, [even his] wrath, has gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it will burst on the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The fierce anger of Yahweh will not return, until he has executed, and until he has performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you{+} will understand it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
