Or what is our iniquity? Or what is our sin that we have committed against Yahweh our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then you will say to them, Because your{+} fathers have forsaken me, says Yahweh, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me, and haven't kept my law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and you{+} have done evil more than your{+} fathers; for, look, you{+} walk every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart, so that you{+} don't listen to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>therefore I will cast you{+} forth out of this land into the land that you{+} haven't known, neither you{+} nor your{+} fathers; and there you{+} will serve other gods day and night; for I will show you{+} no favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, look, the days come, says Yahweh, that it will no more be said, As Yahweh lives, that brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but, As Yahweh lives, that brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the countries where he had driven them. And I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Look, I will send for many fishers, says Yahweh, and they will fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their disgusting things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to you will the nations come from the ends of the earth, and will say, Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, [even] vanity and things in which there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Will man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, look, I will cause them to know, this once I will cause them to know my hand and my might; and they will know that my name is Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
