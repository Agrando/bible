Thus says Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe to Nebo! For it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her: Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. You also, O Madmen, will be brought to silence: the sword will pursue you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>The sound of a cry from Horonaim, desolation and great destruction!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Moab is destroyed; They caused a cry to be heard as far as Zoar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping they will go up; for at the descent of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Flee, save your{+} lives, and be like a juniper in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For, because you have trusted in your works and in your treasures, you also will be taken: and Chemosh will go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the destroyer will come upon every city, and no city will escape; the valley also will perish, and the plain will be destroyed; as Yahweh has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Give wings to Moab, that she may fly and get away: and her cities will become a desolation, without any to dwell in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Cursed be he who does the work of Yahweh negligently; and cursed be he who keeps back his sword from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees, and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remains in him, and his scent is not changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, look, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will send to him those who pour off, and they will pour him off; and they will empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Moab will be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How do you{+} say, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Moab is laid waste, and they have gone up into his cities, and his chosen young men have gone down to the slaughter, says the King, whose name is Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hurries fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All you{+} who are round about him, bemoan him, and all you{+} who know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>O you daughter who dwells in Dibon, come down from your glory, and sit in thirst; for the destroyer of Moab has come up against you, he has destroyed your strongholds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and watch: ask him who flees, and her who escapes; say, What has been done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moab is put to shame; for it is broken down: wail and cry; tell{+} it by the Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And judgment has come upon the plain country, on Holon, and on Jahzah, and on Mephaath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth-diblathaim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and on Kiriathaim, and on Beth-gamul, and on Beth-meon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, and on all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Make{+} him drunk; for he magnified himself against Yahweh: and Moab will wallow in his vomit, and he also will be in derision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For wasn't Israel a derision to you? Was he found among thieves? For as often as you speak of him, you wag the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>O you{+} inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and stay in the rock; and be like the dove that makes her nest over the mouth of the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We have heard of the pride of Moab, [that] he is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogance, and the haughtiness of his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I know his wrath, says Yahweh, that it is nothing; his boastings have wrought nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore I will wail for Moab; yes, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres they will mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>With more than the weeping of Jazer I will weep for you, O vine of Sibmah: your branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: on your summer fruits and on your vintage the destroyer has fallen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And gladness and joy is taken away from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the winepresses: none will tread with shouting; the shouting will be no shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, even to Jahaz they have uttered their voice, from Zoar even to Horonaim, to Eglath-shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also will become desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, says Yahweh, him who offers in the high place, and him who burns incense to his gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes, and my heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: therefore the abundance that he has gotten has perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: on all the hands are cuttings, and on the loins sackcloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>On all the housetops of Moab and in its streets there is lamentation every where; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which none delights, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>How it is broken down! [How] they wail! How Moab has turned the back with shame! So will Moab become a derision and a terror to all who are round about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For thus says Yahweh: Look, he will fly as an eagle, and will spread out his wings against Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day will be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Moab will be destroyed from being a people, because he has magnified himself against Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are on you, O inhabitant of Moab, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>He who flees from the fear will fall into the pit; and he who gets up out of the pit will be taken in the snare: for I will bring on Moab the year of their visitation, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon; for a fire has gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and has devoured the corner of Moab, and the top of the head of the tumultuous ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Woe to you, O Moab! The people of Chemosh is undone; for your sons are taken away captive, and your daughters into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days, says Yahweh. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
