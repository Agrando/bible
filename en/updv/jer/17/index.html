Those who depart from me will be written in the earth, because they have forsaken Yahweh, the fountain of living waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Heal me, O Yahweh, and I will be healed; save me, and I will be saved: for you are my praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Look, they say to me, Where is the word of Yahweh? Let it come now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for me, I haven't hurried from being a shepherd after you; neither have I desired the woeful day; you know: that which came out of my lips was before your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Don't be a terror to me: you are my refuge in the day of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let them be put to shame that persecute me, but don't let me be put to shame; let them be dismayed, but don't let me be dismayed; bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus Yahweh said to me: Go, and stand in the gate of the sons of the people, by which the kings of Judah come in, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and say to them, Hear{+} the word of Yahweh, you{+} kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus says Yahweh, Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the Sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>neither carry forth a burden out of your{+} houses on the Sabbath day, neither do{+} any work: but hallow{+} the Sabbath day, as I commanded your{+} fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they didn't listen, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, and might not receive instruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it will come to pass, if you{+} diligently listen to me, says Yahweh, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, but to hallow the Sabbath day, to do no work in it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>then there will enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and this city will remain forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they will come from the cities of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowland, and from the hill-country, and from the South, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meal-offerings, and frankincense, and bringing [sacrifices of] thanksgiving, to the house of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But if you{+} will not listen to me to hallow the Sabbath day, and not to bear a burden and enter in at the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day; then I will kindle a fire in its gates, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it will not be quenched.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
