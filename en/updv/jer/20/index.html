Then said Jeremiah to him, Yahweh has not called your name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For thus says Yahweh, Look, I will make you a terror to yourself, and to all your friends; and they will fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will watch it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will carry them captive to Babylon, and will slay them with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all its gains, and all its precious things, yes, all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies; and they will make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you, Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house will go into captivity; and you will come to Babylon, and there you will die, and there you will be buried, you, and all your friends, to whom you have prophesied falsely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O Yahweh, you have persuaded me, and I was persuaded; you are stronger than I, and have prevailed: I have become a laughingstock all the day, everyone mocks me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! Because the word of Yahweh has been a reproach to me, and a derision, all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak anymore in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I can't [contain].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, [say] all my friends among common man, those who watch for my fall; perhaps he will be persuaded, and we will prevail against him, and we will take our revenge on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Yahweh is with me as a mighty one [and] a terrible: therefore my persecutors will stumble, and they will not prevail; they will be completely put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which will never be forgotten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, O Yahweh of hosts, that try the righteous, that see the heart and the mind, let me see your vengeance on them; for to you I have revealed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sing to Yahweh, praise you{+} Yahweh; for he has delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Cursed be the day in which I was born: don't let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Cursed be the man who brought good news to my father, saying, A man-child is born to you; making him very glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let that man be as the cities which Yahweh overthrew, and didn't repent: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because he didn't slay me from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always pregnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why did I come forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
