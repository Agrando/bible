Look, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are you{+} in my hand, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>At what instant I will speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>if that nation, concerning which I have spoken, turns from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And at what instant I will speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>if they do that which is evil in my sight, that they do not obey my voice, then I will repent of the good, with which I said I would benefit them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now therefore, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus says Yahweh: Look, I frame evil against you{+}, and devise a device against you{+}: return{+} now every one from his evil way, and amend your{+} ways and your{+} doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But they say, It is in vain; for we will walk after our own devices, and we will do every one after the stubbornness of his evil heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh: Ask{+} now among the nations, who has heard such things; the virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Will the snow of Lebanon fail from the rock of Shaddai? [Or] will the cold waters that flow down from far away be dried up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to false [gods]; and they made them stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in bypaths, in a way not cast up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to make their land an astonishment, and a perpetual hissing; everyone who passes by it will be astonished, and shake his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will see them with the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they said, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law will not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Give heed to me, O Yahweh, and listen to the voice of those who contend with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Will evil be recompensed for good? For they have dug a pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before you to speak good for them, to turn away your wrath from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore deliver up their sons to the famine, and give them over to the power of the sword; and let their wives become childless, and widows; and let their men be slain of death, [and] their young men struck of the sword in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you will bring a troop suddenly on them; for they have dug a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Yet, Yahweh, you know all their counsel against me to slay me; don't forgive their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from your sight; but let them be overthrown before you; deal with them in the time of your anger.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
