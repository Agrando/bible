And they will dwell in their own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Concerning the prophets. My heart inside me is broken, all my bones shake; I am like a drunk man, and like an [able-bodied] man whom wine has overcome, because of Yahweh, and because of his holy words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up. And their course is evil, and their might is not right;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for both prophet and priest are profane; yes, in my house I have found their wickedness, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore their way will be to them as slippery places in the darkness: they will be driven on, and fall in it; for I will bring evil on them, even the year of their visitation, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the prophets of Jerusalem also I have seen a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies; and they strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that none returns from his wickedness: they are all of them to me as Sodom, and its inhabitants as Gomorrah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore this is what Yahweh of Hosts says concerning the prophets: Look, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem has ungodliness gone forth into all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says Yahweh of hosts, Don't listen to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you{+}: they teach you{+} vanity; they speak a vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say continually to those who despise me, Yahweh has said, You{+} will have peace; and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart they say, No evil will come upon you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For who has stood in the council of Yahweh, that he should perceive and hear his word? Who has marked my word, and heard it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Look, the tempest of Yahweh, [even his] wrath, has gone forth, yes, a whirling tempest: it will burst on the head of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The anger of Yahweh will not return, until he has executed, and until he has performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you{+} will understand it perfectly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I did not send these prophets, yet they ran: I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they had stood in my council, then they would cause my people to hear my words, and turn them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Am I a God at hand, says Yahweh, and not a God far off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Can any hide himself in secret places so that I will not see him? says Yahweh. Don't I fill heaven and earth? says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I have heard what the prophets have said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>How long will this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, even the prophets of the deceit of their own heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his fellow man, as their fathers forgot my name for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The prophet who has a dream, let him tell a dream; and he who has my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the straw to the wheat? says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Isn't my word like fire? says Yahweh; and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, look, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, that steal my words every man from his fellow man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Look, I am against the prophets, says Yahweh, that use their tongues, and say, He says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Look, I am against those who prophesy lying dreams, says Yahweh, and tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their vain boasting: yet I did not send them, nor command them; neither do they profit this people at all, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, will ask you, saying, What is the burden of Yahweh? Then you will say to them, You are the burden. I will cast you{+} off, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that will say, The burden of Yahweh, I will even punish that man and his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus you{+} will say every man to his fellow man, and every man to his brother, What has Yahweh answered? And, What has Yahweh spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And the burden of Yahweh you{+} will mention no more: for every man's own word will be his burden; for you{+} have perverted the words of the living God, of Yahweh of hosts our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus you will say to the prophet, What has Yahweh answered you? And, What has Yahweh spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if you{+} say, The burden of Yahweh; therefore thus says Yahweh: Because you{+} say this word, The burden of Yahweh, and I have sent to you{+}, saying, You{+} will not say, The burden of Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>therefore, look, I will surely lift you{+} up, and I will cast you{+} off, and the city that I gave to you{+} and to your{+} fathers, away from my presence:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and I will bring an everlasting reproach on you{+}, and a perpetual shame, which will not be forgotten.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
