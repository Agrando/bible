And speak them to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and say to them, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>which I commanded your{+} fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you{+}: so you{+} will be my people, and I will be your{+} God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>that I may establish the oath which I swore to your{+} fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day. Then I answered, and said, Amen, O Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Yahweh said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear{+} the words of this covenant, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For I earnestly protested to your{+} fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet they didn't obey, nor incline their ear, but walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart: therefore I brought on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they didn't do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Yahweh said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they have gone after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh, Look, I will bring evil on them, which they will not be able to escape; and they will cry to me, but I will not listen to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then will the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they will not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you{+} set up altars to the shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore don't pray for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them; for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me because of their trouble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has wrought lewdness [with] many, and the holy flesh has passed from you? When you do evil, then you rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yahweh called your name, A green olive-tree, beautiful with goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Yahweh of hosts, who planted you, has pronounced evil against you, because of the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have wrought for themselves in provoking me to anger by offering incense to Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Yahweh gave me knowledge of it, and I knew it: then you showed me their doings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I was like a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter; and I didn't know that they had devised devices against me, [saying], Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be remembered no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But, O Yahweh of hosts, who judges righteously, who tries the heart and the mind, I will see your vengeance on them; for to you I have revealed my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, You will not prophesy in the name of Yahweh, that you will not die by our hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>therefore this is what Yahweh of Hosts says, Look, I will punish them: the young men will die by the sword; their sons and their daughters will die by famine;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and there will be no remnant to them: for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
