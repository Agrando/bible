And those who handle the law didn't know me: the rulers also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will yet contend with you{+}, says Yahweh, and with the sons of your{+} sons I will contend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently; and see if there has been such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Has a nation exchanged [its] gods, which yet are no gods? But my people have exchanged their glory for that which does not profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be astonished, O you{+} heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be{+} very desolate, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is Israel a slave? Is he a home-born [slave]? Why has he become a prey?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The young lions have roared on him, and yelled; and they have made his land waste: his cities are burned up, without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The sons also of Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken the top of your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Have you not procured this to yourself, in that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, when he led you by the way?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now what have you to do in the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Shihor? Or what have you to do in the way to Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your own wickedness will correct you, and your backslidings will reprove you: know therefore and see that it is an evil and bitter thing, that you have forsaken Yahweh your God, and that my fear is not in you, says the Lord, Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For of old time I have broken your yoke, and burst your bonds; and you said, I will not serve; for on every high hill and under every green tree you were laying down prostituting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yet I had planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then have you turned into the wild branches of a foreign vine to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For though you wash yourself with lye, and take yourself much soap, yet your iniquity is marked before me, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>How can you say, I am not defiled, I haven't gone after the Baalim? See your way in the valley, know what you have done: [you are] a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>a wild donkey used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind in her desire; in her occasion who can turn her away? All those who seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they will find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Withhold your foot from being unshod, and your throat from thirst: but you said, It is in vain; no, for I have loved strangers, and I will go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>who say to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face; but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But where are your gods that you have made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Why will you{+} contend with me? All of you{+} have transgressed against me, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>In vain I have struck your{+} sons; they received no correction: your{+} own sword has devoured your{+} prophets, like a destroying lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>O generation, see{+} the word of Yahweh. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? Or a land of thick darkness? Why do my people say, We have broken loose; we will come no more to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Can a virgin forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>How you trim your way to seek love! Therefore even the wicked women you have taught your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Also in your skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor: you did not find them breaking in; but it is because of all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Yet you said, I am innocent; surely his anger has turned away from me. Look, I will enter into judgment with you, because you say, I haven't sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Why do you want to go away so much to change your course? You will be ashamed of Egypt also, as you were ashamed of Assyria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>From there also you will go forth, with your hands on your head: for Yahweh has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
