You have stricken them, but they were not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish; for they don't know the way of Yahweh, nor the law of their God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will get myself to the great men, and will speak to them; for they know the way of Yahweh, and the law of their God. But these with one accord have broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore a lion out of the forest will slay them, a wolf of the evenings will destroy them, a leopard will watch against their cities; everyone who goes out from there will be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, [and] their backslidings have increased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How can I pardon you? Your sons have forsaken me, and sworn by those that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they committed adultery, and they dwell at a prostitute's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They were as fed horses roaming at large; everyone neighed after his fellow man's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; and will not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go{+} up on her walls, and destroy; but don't make a full end: take away her branches; for they are not Yahweh's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have totally betrayed me, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They have denied Yahweh, and said, It is not he; neither will evil come upon us; neither will we see sword nor famine:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and the prophets will become wind, and the word is not in them: thus it will be done to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, Because you{+} speak this word, look, I will make my words in your mouth fire, and this people wood, and it will devour them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Look, I will bring a nation on you{+} from far, O house of Israel, says Yahweh: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language you don't know, neither understand what they say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Their quiver is an open tomb, they are all mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they will eat up your harvest, and your bread, [which] your sons and your daughters should eat; they will eat up your flocks and your herds; they will eat up your vines and your fig-trees; they will beat down your fortified cities, in which you trust, with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But even in those days, says Yahweh, I will not make a full end with you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it will come to pass, when you{+} will say, Why has Yahweh our God done all these things to us? Then you will say to them, Like you{+} have forsaken me, and served foreign gods in your{+} land, so you{+} will serve strangers in a land that is not yours{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Declare{+} this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; that have eyes, and don't see; that have ears, and don't hear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Don't you{+} fear me? says Yahweh: Will you{+} not tremble at my presence, who has placed the sand for the bound of the sea, by a perpetual decree, that it can't pass it? And though its waves toss themselves, yet they can't prevail; though they roar, yet they can't pass over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they have revolted and gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Neither do they say in their heart, Let us now fear Yahweh our God, that gives rain, both the former and the latter, in its season; that preserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Your{+} iniquities have turned away these things, and your{+} sins have withheld good from you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For among my people are found wicked men: they watch, as a fowler lying in wait; they set a trap, they catch men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As a cage is full of birds, so their houses are full of deceit: therefore they have become great, and waxed rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They are waxed fat, they shine: yes, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they don't plead the cause, the cause of the fatherless, that they may prosper; and they don't judge the right of the needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Shall I not visit for these things? says Yahweh; will not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>A wonderful and horrible thing has come to pass in the land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>the prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will you{+} do in the end of it?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
