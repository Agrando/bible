Did not your father eat and drink, and do justice and righteousness? Then it was well with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well. Wasn't this the knowledge of me? says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But your eyes and your heart are not but for your covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah: they will not lament for him, [saying], Ah my brother! Or, Ah sister! They will not lament for him, [saying] Ah lord! Or, Ah his glory!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up your voice in Bashan, and cry from Abarim; for all your lovers are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I spoke to you in your prosperity; but you said, I will not hear. This has been your manner from your youth, that you didn't obey my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The wind will shepherd all your shepherds, and your lovers will go into captivity: surely then you will be ashamed and confounded for all your wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>O inhabitant of Lebanon, that make your nest in the cedars, how greatly to be pitied you will be when pangs come upon you, the pain as of a woman in travail!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As I live, says Yahweh, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet I would pluck you from there;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and I will give you into the hand of those who seek your life, and into the hand of them of whom you are afraid, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will cast you out, and your mother who bore you, into another country, where you{+} were not born; and there you{+} will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But to the land to where their soul longs to return, they will not return there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Is this man Coniah a despised broken vessel? Is he a vessel in which none delights? Why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into the land which they don't know?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Thus says Yahweh, Write{+} this man childless, a [prominent] man who will not prosper in his days; for no more will a man of his seed prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling in Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
