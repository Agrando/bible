Will not that land be greatly polluted? But you have prostituted with many companions; yet return again to me, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see; where haven't you been lain with? By the ways you have sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your prostitution and with your wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; yet you have a prostitute's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will you not from this time cry to me, My Father, you are the best friend of my youth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Will he retain [his anger] forever? Will he keep it to the end? Look, you have spoken and have done evil things, and have had your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Moreover Yahweh said to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? She's gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree and prostituted there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I said after she had done all these things, She will return to me; but she didn't return: and her betraying sister Judah saw it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce, yet betraying Judah her sister didn't fear; but she also went and prostituted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass through the lightness of her prostitution, that she defiled herself together with the land, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And yet for all this her betraying sister Judah has not returned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Yahweh said to me, Backsliding Israel has shown herself more righteous than betraying Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, says Yahweh; I will not look in anger on you{+}; for I am merciful, says Yahweh, I will not keep [anger] forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against Yahweh your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you{+} haven't obeyed my voice, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Return, O backsliding sons, says Yahweh; for I am a husband to you{+}: and I will take you{+} one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you{+} to Zion:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I will give you{+} shepherds according to my heart, who will shepherd you{+} with knowledge and understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it will come to pass, when you{+} have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says Yahweh, they will say no more, The ark of the covenant of Yahweh; neither will it come to mind; neither will they remember it; neither will they miss it; neither will it be made anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>At that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Yahweh; and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of Yahweh, to Jerusalem: neither will they walk anymore after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and they will come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance to your{+} fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I said, How I will put you among the sons, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! And I said, You will call me My Father, and will not turn away from following me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely as a wife betrays [by divorcing] from her companion, so you{+} have betrayed me, O house of Israel, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A voice is heard on the bare heights, the weeping [and] the supplications of the sons of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten Yahweh their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Return, you{+} backsliding sons, I will heal your{+} backslidings. Look, we have come to you; for you are Yahweh our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Truly, delusion comes from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: [but] truly in Yahweh our God is the salvation of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the shameful thing has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against Yahweh our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day; and we haven't obeyed the voice of Yahweh our God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
