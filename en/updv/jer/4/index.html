Surely you have greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, You{+} will have peace; whereas the sword reaches to the life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A hot wind from the bare heights in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow, nor to cleanse;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>a full wind from these will come for me: now I will also utter judgments against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Look, he will come up as clouds, and his chariots [will be] as the whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! For we are ruined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long will your evil thoughts lodge inside you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For a voice declares from Dan, and publishes evil from the hills of Ephraim:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>make mention to the nations; Look, publish against Jerusalem [that] watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As keepers of a field are those against her round about, because she has been rebellious against me, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your way and your doings have procured these things to you; this is your wickedness; for it is bitter, for it reaches to your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Inside me, inside me! I am pained at my very heart; my heart is disquieted in me; I can't hold my peace; because you have heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Destruction on destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste: suddenly my tents are destroyed, [and] my curtains in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For my people are foolish; they don't know me. They are foolish sons, and they have no understanding. They are wise to do evil; but to do good they don't know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I saw the earth, and, look, it was waste and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I saw the mountains, and, look, they trembled, and all the hills moved to and fro.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I looked and saw that man was not there, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I looked and saw that the fruitful field was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of Yahweh, [and] before his fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thus says Yahweh, The whole land will be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this the earth will mourn, and the heavens above be black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and I have not repented, neither will I turn back from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Every city flees for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they come into holes, hide in thickets, and climb up on the rocks: every city is forsaken, and not a man dwells in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you, when you are made desolate, what will you do? Though you dress yourself with scarlet, though you deck you with ornaments of gold, though you enlarge your eyes with paint, in vain you make yourself fair; [your] lovers despise you, they seek your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her who brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, who gasps for breath, who spreads her hands, [saying], Woe is me now! For my soul faints before the murderers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
