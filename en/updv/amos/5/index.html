Alas! And they will call the husbandman to mourning, and a wailing for such as are skillful in lamentation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in all vineyards will be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of you, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Woe to you{+} who desire the day of Yahweh! Why would you{+} have the day of Yahweh? It is darkness, and not light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Will not the day of Yahweh be darkness, and not light? Even very dark, and no brightness in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I hate, I despise your{+} feasts, and I will take no delight in your{+} solemn assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Yes, though you{+} offer me your{+} burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your{+} fat beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Take away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your viols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Did you{+} bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, you{+} have borne the tabernacle of your{+} king and the Kewan--your{+} idols, the star of your{+} god which you{+} made to yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore I will cause you{+} to go into captivity beyond Damascus, says Yahweh, whose name is the God of hosts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
