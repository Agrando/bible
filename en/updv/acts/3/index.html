In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he took him by the right hand, and raised him up: and immediately his feet and his anklebones received strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And leaping up, he stood, and began to walk; and he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and they took knowledge of him, that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, greatly wondering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, Men, Israelites, why do you{+} marvel at this man? Or why do you{+} fasten your{+} eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you{+} delivered up, and denied before the face of Pilate, when he had determined to release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But you{+} denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a man [who was] a murderer to be granted to you{+},</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and killed the Prince of life; whom God raised from the dead; of which we are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And by faith in his name has his name made this man strong, whom you{+} see and know: yes, the faith which is through him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of all of you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, brothers, I know that in ignorance you{+} participated in it, as also did your{+} rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things which God foreshowed by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he thus fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Repent{+} therefore, and turn again, that your{+} sins may be blotted out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ who has been appointed for you{+}, [even] Jesus:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whom the heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets that have been from of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses indeed said, A prophet will Yahweh your{+} God raise up to you{+} from among your{+} brothers, like me.
