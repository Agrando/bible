And some said, What would this babbler say? Others, He seems to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached [the good news of] Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is, which is spoken by you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you bring certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Paul stood among the Areopagus, and said, Men, Atheneans, in all things, I perceive that you{+} are very religious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your{+} worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you{+} worship in ignorance, this I set forth to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he himself gives to all life, and breath, and all things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and he made of one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined [their] appointed seasons, and the bounds of their habitation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that they should seek God, if perhaps they might feel after him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain even of your{+} own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the divine nature is like gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and device of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked; but now he commands men that they should all everywhere repent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>inasmuch as he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by the man whom he has appointed; he has given assurance of this to all men, in that he has raised him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; but others said, We will hear you concerning this yet again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus Paul went out from among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But certain men stuck [close] to him, and believed: among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
