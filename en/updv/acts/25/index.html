I appeal to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar: to Caesar you will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when certain days were passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea saluting Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as they spent many days there, Festus laid Paul's case before the King, saying, There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed [me], asking for sentence against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To whom I answered, that it is not Roman custom to give up any man, until the accused has the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make his defense concerning the matter laid against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When therefore they had come together here, I made no delay, but on the next day sat on the judgment-seat, and commanded the man to be brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such evil things as I supposed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but had certain questions against him of their own religion, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I, being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things, asked whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I should send him to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Agrippa [said] to Festus, I also could wish to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, he says, you will hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So on the next day, when Agrippa came, and Bernice, with great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing with the generals and principal men of the city, at the command of Festus Paul was brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus says, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, you{+} see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews made suit to me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I found that he had participated in nothing worthy of death: and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you{+}, and especially before you, King Agrippa, that, after having the examination, I may have somewhat to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not as well to signify the charges against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
