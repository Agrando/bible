And Gallio cared for none of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Paul, having tarried after this yet many days, took his leave of the brothers, and sailed from there for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila: having shorn his head in Cenchreae; for he had a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they asked him to stay a longer time, he did not consent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but taking his leave of them, and saying, I will return again to you{+} if God wills, he set sail from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having spent some time [there], he departed, and went through the region of Galatia, and Phrygia, in order, establishing all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus; and he was mighty in the Scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. But when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more accurately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he was minded to pass over into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: and when he came, he helped them much that had believed through grace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for he powerfully confuted the Jews publicly, showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
