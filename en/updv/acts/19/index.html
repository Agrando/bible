And they [said] to him, No, we did not even hear whether the Holy Spirit was [given].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he said, Into what then were you{+} baptized? And they said, Into John's baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they were in all about twelve men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he entered into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, reasoning and persuading [as to] the things concerning the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this continued for the space of two years; so that all those who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And God did special miracles by the hands of Paul:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>insomuch that to the sick were carried away from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the evil spirits went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But certain also of the strolling Jews, exorcists, took on them to name over those who had the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you{+} by Jesus whom Paul preaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest, who did this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the evil spirit answered and said to them, Jesus I know, and Paul I am aware of, but who are you{+}?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaped on them, and mastered both of them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, that dwelt at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Many also of those who had believed came, confessing, and declaring their activities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And not a few of those who participated in magical arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all; and they counted the price of them, and found it was $1 Million.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So, by the power of the Lord, the word kept spreading and growing stronger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now after these things had ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself remained in Asia for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And about that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom he gathered together, with the workers of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you{+} know that by this business we have our wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you{+} see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and not only is there danger that this trade of ours come into disrepute; but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be made of no account, and that she should even be deposed from her magnificence whom all Asia and the world worships.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when they heard this they were filled with wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the city was filled with the confusion: and they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's travel companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Paul was minded to enter in to the people, the disciples did not allow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him and implored him not to adventure himself into the theatre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was in confusion; and most didn't know why they had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defense to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the townclerk had quieted the multitude, he says, Men, Ephesians, what man is there who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Artemis, and of the [image] which fell down from Jupiter?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Seeing then that these things can't be opposed, you{+} ought to be quiet, and to participate in nothing rash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For you{+} have brought [here] these men, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If therefore Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a matter against any man, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if you{+} seek after something more, it will be settled in the regular assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For indeed we are in danger to be accused concerning this day's riot, there being no cause [for it]: and as concerning it we will not be able to give account of this concourse. And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
