And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have gone up for a memorial before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now send men to Joppa, and fetch one Simon, who is surnamed Peter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the seaside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the angel that spoke to him had departed, he called two of his household slaves, and a devout soldier of those who waited on him continually;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and having rehearsed all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now on the next day, as they were on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and he became hungry, and desired to eat: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and he looks at heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were a great sheet, let down by four corners on the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>in which were all manner of four-footed beasts and creeping things of the earth and birds of the heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill and eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common and unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And a voice [came] to him again the second time, What God has cleansed, don't make common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this was done thrice: and immediately the vessel was received up into heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what the vision which he had seen might be, look, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood before the gate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, was lodging there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And while Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Look, three men are seeking you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But arise, and go down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter went down to the men, and said, Look, I am he whom you{+} seek: what is the cause why you{+} have come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said, Captain Cornelius, a righteous man and one who fears God, and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews, was warned [of God] by a holy angel to send for you into his house, and to hear words from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he called them in and lodged them. And on the next day he arose and went forth with them, and certain of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And on the next day he entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and his near friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when it came to pass that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter raised him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he talked with him, he went in, and finds many come together:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he said to them, You{+} yourselves know how it is an unlawful thing for a man who is a Jew to stick [close] to or come to one of another nation; and [yet] to me has God shown that I should not call any man common or unclean:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>therefore also I came without opposing, when I was sent for. I ask, therefore, what [is the] reason you{+} sent for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Cornelius said, Four days ago, until this hour, I was keeping the ninth hour of prayer in my house; and look, a man stood before me in bright apparel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and says, Cornelius, your prayer is heard, and your alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa, and call to you Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he lodges in the house of Simon a tanner, by the seaside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Forthwith therefore I sent to you; and you have well done that you have come. Now therefore we are all here present in the sight of God, to hear all things that have been commanded you of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but in every nation he who fears him, and works righteousness, is acceptable to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ [saying that], He is Lord of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>That saying you{+} yourselves know, which was published throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>[even] Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom also they slew, hanging him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God raised him up on the third day, and gave him to be made manifest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen before of God, [even] to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he charged us to preach to the people, and to testify that this is he who is appointed of God [to be] the Judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>To him all the prophets bear witness, that through his name everyone who believes on him will receive remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they of the circumcision that believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then Peter answered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they prayed him to tarry some days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
