and they listened to Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, listen to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Symeon has rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen; And I will build again its ruins, And I will set it up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, on whom my name is called, says the Lord, [who is] doing these things</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[as they were] known from of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore my judgment is, that we not trouble those who from among the Gentiles turn to God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but that we write to them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Moses from generations of old has in every city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; [namely], Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brothers:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they wrote [thus] by them, The apostles and the elders, brothers, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you{+} with words, subverting your{+} souls; to whom we gave no commandment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them to you{+} with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men who have delivered up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also will tell you{+} the same things by word of mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay on you{+} no greater burden than these necessary things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that you{+} abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if you{+} keep yourselves, you{+} will do reasonably well. Take care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after they had been [there] for some time, they were dismissed in peace from the brothers to those who had sent them forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But Paul and Barnabas spent time in Antioch, teaching and preaching [the good news of] the word of the Lord, with many others also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, [and see] how they fare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul thought it not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and didn't go with them to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And there arose a sharp contention, so that they separated apart one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away to Cyprus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being delivered to [the care of] the grace of the Lord by the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
