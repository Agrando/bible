and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But these had gone before, and stayed [waiting] for us at Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days, where we spent seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And on the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the next day; and prolonged his speech until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were many lights in the upper chamber where we were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there sat in the window a certain young man named Eutychus, borne down with deep sleep; and as Paul discoursed yet longer, being borne down by his sleep he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said, Don't be{+} distressed; for his life is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when he had gone up, and had broken the bread, and eaten, and had talked with them a long while, even until break of day, so he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they brought the boy alive, and were not a little comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we, going ahead to the ship, set sail for Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, intending himself to go by land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he met us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And sailing from there, we came the following day across from Chios; and the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after we came to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying, if it might be possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to him the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they had come to him, he said to them, You{+} yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, after what manner I was with you{+} all the time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving as a slave to the Lord with all lowliness of mind, and with tears, and with trials which befell me by the plots of the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>how I did not shrink from declaring to you{+} anything that was profitable, and teaching you{+} publicly, and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, look, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will befall me there:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I don't hold my life of any account as dear to myself, so that I may accomplish my course, and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the good news of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, look, I know that all of you{+}, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I testify to you{+} this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I did not shrink from declaring to you{+} the whole counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take heed to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you{+} overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know that after my departing grievous wolves will enter in among you{+}, not sparing the flock;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and from among your{+} own selves will men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore watch{+}, remembering that by the space of three years I did not cease to admonish each one [of you{+}] night and day with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And now I commend you{+} to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build [you{+}] up, and to give [you{+}] the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You{+} yourselves know that these hands served to my necessities, and to those who were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>In all things I gave you{+} an example, that so laboring you{+} ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he had thus spoken, having knelt down with them all, he prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all wept intensely, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>sorrowing most of all for the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. And they brought him on his way to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
