The same called to him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Saul, who is also [called] Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, fastened his eyes on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said, O full of all guile and all villany, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, look, the hand of the Lord is on you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men, brothers, if you{+} have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said, Men, Israelites, and you{+} who fear God, listen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And for about the time of forty years as a foster-father he bore them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave [them] their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and after these things he gave [them] judges until Samuel the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterward they asked for a king: and God gave to them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king; to whom also he bore witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will do all My will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Of this man's seed has God according to promise brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What do you{+} suppose that I am? I am not [he]. But look, there comes one after me the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Men, brothers, sons of the stock of Abraham, and those among you{+} who fear God, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they didn't know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled [them] by condemning [him].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And though they found no cause of death [in him], yet they asked of Pilate that he should be slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised him from the dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and he was seen for many days of those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we bring you{+} good news of the promise made to the fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>that God has fulfilled these things to us, their children, in that he raised up Jesus; as also it is written in the second psalm, You are my Son, this day I have begotten you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he has spoken on this wise, I will give you{+} the holy and sure [blessings] of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Because he says also in another [psalm], You will not give Your Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David, after he had in his own generation served the counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid to his fathers, and saw corruption:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but he whom God raised up saw no corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Be it known to you{+} therefore, men, brothers, that through this man is proclaimed to you{+} remission of sins, and from all things which you{+} could not be justified by the law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>By this man everyone who believes is justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Beware therefore, lest that come upon [you{+}] which is spoken in the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Look, you{+} despisers, and wonder, and perish; For I work a work in your{+} days, A work which you{+} will in no way believe, if one declares it to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as they went out, they implored that these words might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you{+}. Seeing you{+} thrust it from you{+}, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, look, we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so has the Lord commanded us, [saying], I have set you for a light of the Gentiles, That you should be for salvation to the uttermost part of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the word of the Lord was spread abroad throughout all the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came to Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
