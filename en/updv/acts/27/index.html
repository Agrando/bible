and he put us in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with difficulty across from Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under the lee of Crete, across from Salmone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and with difficulty coasting along it we came to a certain place called Fair Havens; near to where was the city of Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when much time was spent, and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already gone by, Paul admonished them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said to them, Men, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the load and the ship, but also of our lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the captain gave more heed to the master and to the owner of the ship, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, most advised to put to sea from there, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, and winter [there; which is] a haven of Crete, looking northeast and southeast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close in shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But after no long time there beat down from it a tempestuous wind, which is called Euraquilo:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when the ship was caught, and could not face the wind, we gave way [to it,] and were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and when they had hoisted it up, they used helps, under-girding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and so were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as we exceedingly labored with the storm, the next day they began to throw the [the freight] overboard;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the third day they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when neither sun nor stars shone on [us] for many days, and no small tempest lay on [us,] all hope that we should be saved was now taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had been long without food, then Paul stood among them, and said, Men, you{+} should have listened to me, and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this injury and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I exhort you{+} to be of good cheer; for there will be no loss of life among you{+}, but [only] of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, whom I also serve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Don't be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar: and look, God has granted you all those who sail with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore, men, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it will be even so as it has been spoken to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But we must be cast on a certain island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when the fourteenth night came, as we were driven to and fro in the [sea of] Adria, about the middle of the night the sailors surmised that they were drawing near to some country:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and they sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and after a little space, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And fearing lest perhaps we should be cast ashore on rocky ground, they let go four anchors from the stern, and wished for the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under color as though they would lay out anchors from the foreship,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the captain and to the soldiers, Except these stay in the ship, you{+} can't be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And while the day was coming on, Paul implored them all to take some food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you{+} wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore I urge you{+} to take some food: for this is for your{+} safety: for there will not a hair perish from the head of any of you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all; and he broke it, and began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then they were all of good cheer, and themselves also took food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when it was day, they didn't know the land: but they perceived a certain bay with a beach, and they took counsel whether they could drive the ship on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosing the bands of the rudders; and hoisting up the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But having fallen on a place where two seas met, they ran the vessel aground; and the foreship struck and stayed unmoveable, but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any [of them] should swim out, and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the captain, desiring to save Paul, prevented them from their purpose; and commanded that they who could swim should cast themselves overboard, and get first to the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the rest, some on planks, and some on [other] things from the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
