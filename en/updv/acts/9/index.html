And he [said], I am Jesus whom you persecute:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but rise, and enter into the city, and it will be told you what you must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Look, I [am here], Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord [said] to him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for look, he prays;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to your saints at Jerusalem:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before Gentiles and kings, and [the] sons of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, [even] Jesus, who appeared to you in the way which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he took food and was strengthened. And he was some days with the disciples who were at Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, He is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all who heard him were amazed, and said, Isn't this he who in Jerusalem made havoc of those who called on this name? And he had come here for this intent, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but their plot became known to Saul. But they were also watching the gates, both day and night, that they might kill him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he came to Jerusalem, he assayed to stick [close] to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>preaching boldly in the name of the Lord: and he spoke and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when the brothers knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, was multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you: arise and make your bed. And immediately he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all who dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And as Lydda was near to Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, entreating him, Do not delay to come through to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Peter arose and went with them. And when he came, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Peter put them all forth, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And it came to pass, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
