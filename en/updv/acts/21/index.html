For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after these days we took up our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there went with us also [certain] of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing [with them] one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had greeted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his service.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they, when they heard it, glorified God; and they said to him, You see, brother, how many tens of thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed; and they are all zealous for the law:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they have been informed concerning you, that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What is it therefore? They will certainly hear that you have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Do therefore this that we say to you: We have four men who have a vow on them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>these take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know that there is no truth in the things of which they have been informed concerning you; but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But as concerning the Gentiles that have believed, we wrote, giving judgment that they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men the next day, having been purified with them, [and] went into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the multitude and laid hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>crying out, Men, Israelites, help: This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place; and moreover he brought Greeks also into the temple, and has defiled this holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For they had before seen with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they laid hold on Paul, and dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they were seeking to kill him, news came up to the Colonel of the Battalion, All Jerusalem is in confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And forthwith he took soldiers and captains, and ran down on them: and they, when they saw the colonel and the soldiers, left off beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the colonel came near, and laid hold on him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and inquired who he might be, and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And some shouted one thing, some another, among the crowd: and when he could not know the certainty for the uproar, he commanded him to be brought into the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the crowd;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as Paul was about to be brought into the castle, he says to the colonel, May I say something to you? And he said, Do you know Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Are you not then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, I am a Jewish man, of Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and I urge you, give me leave to speak to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he had given him leave, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with the hand to the people; and when there was made a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
