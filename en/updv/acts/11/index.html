And these six brothers also accompanied me; and we entered into the man's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house, and saying, Send to Joppa, and fetch Simon, whose surname is Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who will speak to you words, by which you will be saved, you and all your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us in the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John indeed baptized in water; but you{+} will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If then God gave to them the like gift as [he did] also to us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also has God granted repentance to life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They therefore who were scattered abroad on the tribulation that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except only to Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But there were some of them, men, Cyprians and Cyreneans, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecian Jews also, preaching [the good news of] the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number that believed turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the report concerning them came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas to go as far as Antioch:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad; and he exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would continue in the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and many people were added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went forth to Tarsus to seek for Saul;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that even for a whole year they were gathered together with the church, and taught many people, and that the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now in these days there came down prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be a great famine over all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send help to the brothers who dwelt in Judea:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
