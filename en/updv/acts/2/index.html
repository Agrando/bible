and it sat on each one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they were amazed and marveled, saying, Look, are not all these who speak Galileans?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And how do we each hear in our own language in which we were born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, saying one to another, What does this mean?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke forth to them, [saying], Men, Jews, and all you{+} who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be known to you{+}, and give ear to my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For these are not drunk, as you{+} suppose; seeing it is [but] the third hour of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But this is that which has been spoken through the prophet Joel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it will be in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh: And your{+} sons and your{+} daughters will prophesy, And your{+} young men will see visions, And your{+} old men will dream dreams:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yes and on my male slaves and on my female slaves in those days I will pour forth of my Spirit; and they will prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will show wonders in the heaven above, And signs on the earth beneath; Blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun will be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before the day of the Lord comes, That great and notable [day].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it will be, that everyone who will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Men, Israelites, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God to you{+} by mighty works and wonders and signs which God did by him among you{+}, even as you{+} yourselves know;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>him, being delivered up by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you{+} by the hand of lawless men crucified and slew:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says concerning him, I saw the Lord always before my face; For he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; Moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because you will not leave my soul to Hades, Neither will you give your Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of gladness with your countenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Men, brothers, I may say to you{+} freely of the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins he would set [one] on his throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he foreseeing [this] spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he left to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus, God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this, which you{+} both see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not ascend into the heavens: but he says himself, Yahweh said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Let all the house of Israel therefore know assuredly, that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you{+} crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now when they heard [this,] they were pricked in their heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men, brothers, what shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter says to them, Repent{+}, and be baptized each of you{+} in the name of Jesus Christ to the remission of your{+} sins; and you{+} will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For to you{+} is the promise, and to your{+} children, and to all who are far off, [even] as many as Yahweh our God will call to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then they who received his word were baptized: and there were added [to them] in that day about three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all who believed were together, and had all things common;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all, according to as any man had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness and singleness of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to them day by day those who were saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
