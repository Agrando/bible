And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who were with me indeed saw the light, but they didn't hear the voice of him who spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it will be told you of all things which are appointed for you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me I came into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well reported of by all the Jews that dwelt there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>came to me, and standing by me said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And in that very hour I looked up on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said, The God of our fathers has appointed you to know his will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice from his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you will be a witness for him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now why do you tarry? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass, that, when I had returned to Jerusalem, and while I prayed in the temple, I fell into a trance,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and saw him saying to me, Hurry, and get quickly out of Jerusalem; because they will not receive of you testimony concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I said, Lord, they themselves know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue those who believed on you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and when the blood of Stephen your witness was shed, I also was standing by, and giving approval, and keeping the garments of those who slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to me, Depart: for I will send you forth far from here to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they gave him audience to this word; and they lifted up their voice, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And as they cried out, and threw off their garments, and cast dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the colonel commanded him to be brought into the castle, bidding that he should be examined by scourging, that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had tied him up with the thongs, Paul said to the captain that stood by, Is it lawful for you{+} to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the captain heard it, he went to the colonel and told him, saying, What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the colonel came and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the colonel answered, With a great sum I obtained this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am [a Roman] born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They then who were about to examine him immediately departed from him: and the colonel also was afraid when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But on the next day, desiring to know the certainty why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the Sanhedrin to come together, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
