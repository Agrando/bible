and Isaac [begot] Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Joseph, sold him into Egypt: and God was with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and over all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers; and Joseph's race became manifest to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph sent, and called to him Jacob his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and they were carried over to Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as the time of the promise drew near which God assured to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>until there arose another king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babies to the end they might not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At which season Moses was born, and was exceedingly fair; and he was nourished three months in his father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he was well-near forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And seeing one [of them] suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him who was oppressed, striking the Egyptian:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and he supposed that his brothers understood that God by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they didn't understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the day following he appeared to them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Men, you{+} are brothers; why do you{+} wrong one another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he who did his fellow man wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do you want to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begot two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to look, there came a voice of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and did not dare look.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the Lord said to him, Loose the sandals from your feet: for the place on which you stand is holy ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I have surely seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send you into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? God has sent him [to be] both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>This man led them forth, having done wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This is that Moses, who said to the sons of Israel, God will raise up to you{+} a prophet from among your{+} brothers, like me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him in the Mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give to us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts to Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>saying to Aaron, Make us gods that will go before us: for as for this Moses, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But God turned, and delivered them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the Book of the Prophets, Did you{+} offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And you{+} took up the tabernacle of Moloch, And the star of your god Rephan, The figures which you{+} made to worship them: And I will carry you{+} away beyond Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spoke to Moses, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that God thrust out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find a habitation for the house of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But Solomon built him a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nevertheless the Most High does not dwell in [houses] made with hands; as the prophet says,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The heaven is my throne, And the earth the footstool of my feet: What manner of house will you{+} build me? says the Lord: Or what is the place of my rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Did not my hand make all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>You{+} stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you{+} always resist the Holy Spirit: as your{+} fathers did, so do you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Which of the prophets did your{+} fathers not persecute? And they killed those who showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom you{+} have now become traitors and murderers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>you{+} who received the law as it was appointed by angels, and did not keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and said, Look, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed on him with one accord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And they stoned Stephen, calling on and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he knelt down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, do not lay this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
