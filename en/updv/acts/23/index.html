and the assembly was divided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there arose a great clamor: and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part stood up, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: and what if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when there arose a great dissension, the colonel, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the castle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer: for as you have testified concerning me at Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there were more than forty that made this conspiracy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they came to the chief priests and the elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing until we have killed Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore you{+} with the Sanhedrin signify to the colonel that he bring him down to you{+}, as though you{+} would judge of his case more exactly: and we, before he comes near, are ready to slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Paul's sister's son heard of their ambush, and he came and entered into the castle and told Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Paul called to him one of the captains, and said, Bring this young man to the colonel; for he has something to tell him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So he took him, and brought him to the colonel, and says, Paul the prisoner called me to him, and asked me to bring this young man to you, who has something to say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the colonel took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that you have to tell me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring down Paul tomorrow to the Sanhedrin, as though you would inquire somewhat more exactly concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You, therefore, should not yield to them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves under a curse, neither to eat nor to drink until they have slain him: and now they are ready, looking for the promise from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the colonel let the young man go, charging him, Tell no man that you have signified these things to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he called to him two of the captains, and said, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and [he bade them] provide beasts, that they might set Paul on them, and bring him safe to Felix the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he wrote a letter after this form:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix, greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be slain of them, when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought him down to their Sanhedrin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>whom I found to be accused about questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when it was shown to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you forthwith, charging his accusers also to speak the things against him before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and they, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he had read it, he asked of what province he was; and when he understood that he was of Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I will hear you fully, he said, when your accusers also have come: and he commanded him to be kept in Herod's palace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
