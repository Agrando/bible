For that indeed a notable miracle has happened through them, is manifest to all who dwell in Jerusalem; and we can't deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak from now on to no man in this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you{+} rather than to God, you{+} judge:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Sovereign Yahweh, you who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who by the Holy Spirit, [by] the mouth of our father David your son, said, Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples imagine vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together, Against the Lord, and against his Anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For of a truth in this city against your holy Son Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do whatever your hand and your counsel predetermined to come to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, look at their threatenings: and grant to your slaves to speak your word with all boldness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>while you stretch forth your hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of your holy Son Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul: and not one [of them] said that anything of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power the apostles gave their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was on them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For neither was there among them any who lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and laid them at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made to each, according to as anyone had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
