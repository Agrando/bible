And he leaped up and walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest of Jupiter whose [temple] was before the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have sacrificed with the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, Sirs, why do you{+} do these things? We also are men of like passions with you{+}, and bring you{+} good news, that you{+} should turn from these useless things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And yet he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you{+} from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your{+} hearts with food and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And with these sayings they scarcely restrained the multitudes from sacrificing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But there came Jews there from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But as the disciples stood around him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the next day he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had preached the good news to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had appointed for them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been delivered to [the care of] the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they had come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all things that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they spent not a little time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
