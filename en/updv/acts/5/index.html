And after it was sold, was it not in your power? How is it that you have conceived this matter in your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost: and great fear came upon all who heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young men arose and wrapped him round, and they carried him out and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Peter answered to her, Tell me whether you{+} sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Peter [said] to her, How is it that you{+} have agreed together to try the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And she fell down immediately at his feet, and gave up the ghost: and the young men came in and found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her by her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And great fear came upon the whole church, and on all who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders happening among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But of the rest no man dared stick [close] to them: nevertheless the people magnified them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and what's more, believers were added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>insomuch that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that, as Peter came by, at the least his shadow might overshadow some one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there also came together the multitudes from the cities around Jerusalem, bringing sick folk, and those who were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and laid hands on the apostles, and put them in public ward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them out, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go{+}, and stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they heard [this], they entered into the temple about daybreak, and taught. But the high priest came, and those who were with him, and called the Sanhedrin together, and all the senate of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison-house to have them brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the attendants that came didn't find them in the prison; and they returned, and told,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>saying, The prison-house we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing at the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were much perplexed concerning them to what this would grow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there came one and told them, Look, the men whom you{+} put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the captain went with the attendants, and brought them, [but] without violence; for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they had brought them, they set them before the Sanhedrin. And the high priest asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, Didn't we strictly charge you{+} not to teach in this name? And look, you{+} have filled Jerusalem with your{+} teaching, and intend to bring this man's blood on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter and the apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you{+} slew, hanging him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>God exalted him with his right hand [to be] a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we are witnesses of these things; and [so is] the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But they, when they heard this, were cut to the heart, and minded to slay them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But there stood up one in the Sanhedrin, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, highly honored by all the people, and commanded to put the men forth a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves as concerning these men, what you{+} are about to participate in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For before these days Theudas rose up, giving himself out to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed, and came to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the enrollment, and drew away [some of the] people after him: he also perished; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I say to you{+}, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but if it is of God, you{+} will not be able to overthrow them; lest perhaps you{+} are found even to be fighting against God. So they were persuaded by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when they had called the apostles to them, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They therefore departed from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the Name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And every day, in the temple and at home, they did not cease to teach and to preach [the good news of] Christ Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
