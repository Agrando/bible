even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as [it does] in you{+} also, since the day you{+} heard and knew the grace of God in truth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>even as you{+} learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow slave, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your{+} behalf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>who also declared to us your{+} love in the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For this cause we also, since the day we heard [it], do not cease to pray and make request for you{+}, that you{+} may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to walk worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, to all patience and long-suffering with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>giving thanks to the Father, who made you{+} meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>for in him were all things created, in the heavens and on the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and to him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it was the good pleasure [of the Father] that in him should all the fullness dwell;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and through him to reconcile all things to himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross; through him, whether things on the earth, or things in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you{+}, being in time past alienated and enemies in your{+} mind in your{+} evil works,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>yet now he has reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you{+} holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>if indeed you{+} continue in the faith, grounded and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the good news which you{+} heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; of which I Paul was made a servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your{+} sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>of which I was made a servant, according to the dispensation of God which was given me toward you{+}, to fulfill the word of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>[even] the mystery which has been hid since the ages and since the generations: but now it has been manifested to his saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to whom God was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you{+}, the hope of glory:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>to which I labor also, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
