Selah. His glory covered the heavens, And the earth was full of his praise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And [his] brightness was as the light; He had rays [coming forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Before him went the pestilence, And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He stood, and measured the earth; He looked, and drove apart the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered; The everlasting hills bowed down; His goings were [as] of old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian trembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Was Yahweh displeased with the rivers? Was your anger against the rivers, Or your wrath against the sea, That you rode on your horses, On your chariots of salvation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Your bow was bared naked; By means of a word the arrows are assigned by oath. Selah. You split the earth with rivers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The mountains saw you, and were afraid; The tempest of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, And lifted up its hands on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The sun and moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of your arrows as they went, At the shining of your glittering spear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You marched though the land in indignation; You threshed the nations in anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You went forth for the salvation of your people, For the salvation of your anointed; You wounded the head out of the house of the wicked man, Laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You pierced with his own staves the head of his warriors: They came as a whirlwind to scatter me; Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You trod the sea with your horses, The heap of mighty waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I heard, and my body trembled, My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble in my place; Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble, For the coming up of the people that invades us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For though the fig-tree will not flourish, Neither will fruit be in the vines; The labor of the olive will fail, And the fields will yield no food; The flock will be cut off from the fold, And there will be no herd in the stalls:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet I will rejoice in Yahweh, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yahweh, the Lord, is my strength; And he makes my feet like hinds' [feet] And will make me to walk on my high places.
