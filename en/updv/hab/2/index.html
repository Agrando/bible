How long? And that loads himself with pledges!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Will they not rise up suddenly that will bite you, and awake that will vex you, and you will be for booty to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of man's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the hand of evil!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You have devised shame to your house, by cutting off many peoples, and have sinned against your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the stone will cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber will answer it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Woe to him who builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Look, is it not of Yahweh of hosts that the peoples labor for the fire, and the nations weary themselves for vanity?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the earth will be filled with knowledge of the glory of Yahweh, as the waters cover the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Woe to him who gives his fellow man drink, mixing your strong wine, and make him drunk also, that you may look at their nakedness!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You are filled with shame, and not glory: you also drink, and show your foreskin; the cup of Yahweh's right hand will come round to you, and foul shame will be on your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the violence done to Lebanon will cover you, and the destruction of the beasts, which will frighten you; because of man's blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What does it profit the graven image, that its maker has graven it; the molten image, even the teacher of lies, that he who fashions its form trusts in it, to make mute idols?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Woe to him who says to the wood, Awake; Arise! [And] to the mute stone, It will teach. Look, it is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Yahweh is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silent before him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
