He was five years old when the news came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she hurried to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibaal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, as he took his rest at noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And, look, they came there into the midst of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they struck him in the body: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they struck him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David to Hebron, and said to the king, Look, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; and Yahweh has avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>when one told me, saying, Look, Saul is dead, and he was a bearer of good news in his own eyes, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house on his bed, shall I not now require his blood of your{+} hand, and take you{+} away from the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up beside the pool in Hebron.
