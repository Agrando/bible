And Ziba said, The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as are faint in the wilderness may drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the king said, And where is your master's son? And Ziba said to the king, Look, he remains at Jerusalem; for he said, Today will the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the king said to Ziba, Look, all that pertains to Mephibaal is yours. And Ziba said, I do obeisance; let me find favor in your sight, my lord, O king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when King David came to Bahurim, look, there came out from there a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came out, and cursed still as he came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he cast stones at David, and at all the slaves of King David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Begone, begone, you man of blood, and base fellow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yahweh has returned on you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead you have reigned; and Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son; and, look, you are [taken] in your own mischief, because you are a man of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah to the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray you, and take off his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the king said, What have I to do with you{+}, you{+} sons of Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because Yahweh has said to him, Curse David; who then will say, Why have you done so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And David said to Abishai, and to all his slaves, Look, my son, who came forth from my bowels, seeks my life: how much more [may] this Benjamite now [do it]? Let him alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has bidden him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It may be that Yahweh will look at the wrong done to me, and that Yahweh will requite me good for [his] cursing of me this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So David and his men went by the way; and Shimei went along on the hillside across from him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the king, and all the people who were with him, came weary; and he refreshed himself there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, [Long] live the king, [Long] live the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this your kindness to your companion? Why didn't you go with your companion?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Hushai said to Absalom, No; but whom Yahweh, and this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, I will be his, and I will remain with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And again, whom should I serve? [Should I] not [serve] in the presence of his son? As I have served in your father's presence, so I will be in your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give your{+} counsel what we will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Ahithophel said to Absalom, Go in to your father's concubines, that he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you are abhorred of your father: then the hands of all who are with you will be strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man inquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
