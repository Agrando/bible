And Yahweh said to him, Go up. And David said, Where shall I go up? And he said, To Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And his men who were with him David brought up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabesh-gilead were those who buried Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, Blessed be you{+} of Yahweh, that you{+} have shown this kindness to your{+} lord, even to Saul, and have buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now Yahweh show loving-kindness and truth to you{+}: and I also will requite you{+} this kindness, because you{+} have done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore let your{+} hands be strong, and be{+} valiant; for Saul your{+} lord is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, had taken Ishbaal the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Ishbaal, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Abner the son of Ner, and the slaves of Ishbaal the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the slaves of David, went out, and met them by the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men, I pray you, arise and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they arose and went over by number: twelve for Benjamin, and for Ishbaal the son of Saul, and twelve of the slaves of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they caught every one his fellow man by the head, and [thrust] his sword in his fellow man's side; so they fell down together: therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which is in Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the battle was very intense that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the slaves of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he didn't turn to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Is it you, Asahel? And he answered, It is I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abner said to him, Turn yourself aside to your right hand or to your left, and lay yourself hold on one of the young men, and take yourself his armor. But Asahel would not turn aside from following him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn yourself aside from following me: why should I strike you to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Nevertheless he refused to turn aside: therefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear struck him in the body, so that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they had come to the hill of Ammah, that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one band, and stood on the top of a hill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Will the sword devour forever? Don't you know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long will it be then, before you bid the people return from following their brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joab said, As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone away, nor followed every one his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither did they fight anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; and they passed over the Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and came to Mahanaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's slaves nineteen men and Asahel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But the slaves of David had struck of Benjamin, and of Abner's men, [so that] three hundred and threescore men died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was in Beth-lehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and the day broke on them at Hebron.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
