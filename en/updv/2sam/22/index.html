My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge; My savior, you save me from violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: So I will be saved from my enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For the waves of death surrounded me; The floods of ungodliness made me afraid:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The cords of Sheol were round about me; The snares of death came upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In my distress I called on Yahweh; Yes, I called to my God: And he heard my voice out of his temple, And my cry [came] into his ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the earth shook and trembled, The foundations of heaven quaked And were shaken, because he was angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, And fire out of his mouth devoured: Coals were kindled by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He bowed the heavens also, and came down; And thick darkness was under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he rode on a cherub, and flew; Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he made darkness pavilions round about him, Gathering of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>At the brightness before him Coals of fire were kindled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yahweh thundered from heaven, And the Most High uttered his voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; Lightning, and discomfited them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the channels of the sea appeared, The foundations of the world were laid bare, By the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He delivered me from my strong enemy, From those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They came upon me in the day of my calamity; But Yahweh was my support.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He brought me forth also into a large place; He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness; According to the cleanness of my hands he has recompensed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, And have not wickedly departed from my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his ordinances were before me; And as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I was also perfect toward him; And I kept myself from my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore Yahweh has recompensed me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>With the merciful you will show yourself merciful; With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With the pure you will show yourself pure; And with the perverse you will show yourself froward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the afflicted people you will save; But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For you are my lamp, O Yahweh; And Yahweh will lighten my darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For by you I run on a troop; By my God I leap over a wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>As for God, his way is perfect: The word of Yahweh is tried; He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For who is God, but Yahweh? And who is a rock, but our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God is my strong fortress; And he opened up perfectly my way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>He makes his feet like hinds' [feet], And sets me on my high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He teaches my hands to war, So that my arms bend a bow of bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You have also given me the shield of your salvation; And your response has made me great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>You have enlarged my steps under me; And my feet have not slipped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; Neither did I turn again until they were consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they can't arise: Yes, they have fallen under my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For you have girded me with strength to the battle; You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, That I might cut off those who hate me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>They looked, but there was none to save; Even to Yahweh, but he did not answer them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then I beat them small as the dust of the earth, I crush them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people; You have kept me to be the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known will serve me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The foreigners will submit themselves to me: As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The foreigners will fade away, And will come trembling out of their close places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock; And exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Even the God who executes vengeance for me, And that brings down peoples under me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And that brings me forth from my enemies: Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me; You deliver me from the violent man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Therefore I will give thanks to you, O Yahweh, among the nations, And will sing praises to your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Great deliverance he gives to his king, And shows loving-kindness to his anointed, To David and to his seed, forevermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
