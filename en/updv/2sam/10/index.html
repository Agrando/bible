So David sent by his slaves to comfort him concerning his father. And David's slaves came into the land of the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Has not David sent his slaves to you to search the city, and to spy it out, and to overthrow it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Hanun took David's slaves, and shaved off the one half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they told it to David, he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your{+} beards are grown, and then return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had become odious to David, the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zobah, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob twelve thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the entrance of the gate: and the Syrians of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and he put them in array against the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you will help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come and help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Be strong and we will be strengthened for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh will do that which is good in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Joab and the people who were with him drew near to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned from the sons of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they gathered themselves together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians who were beyond the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in array against David, and fought with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians [the men of] seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the captain of their host, so that he died there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when all the kings who were slaves to Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the sons of Ammon anymore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
