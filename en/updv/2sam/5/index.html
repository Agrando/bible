Therefore they say, The blind and the lame will not come into the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And David waxed greater and greater; for Yahweh, the God of hosts, was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David took more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand? And Yahweh said to David, Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And David came to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there; and he said, Yahweh has broken my enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they left their images there; and David and his men took them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when David inquired of Yahweh, he said, You will not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them across from the mulberry-trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it will be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then you will bestir yourself; for then Yahweh has gone out before you to strike the host of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And David did so, as Yahweh commanded him, and struck the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gezer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
