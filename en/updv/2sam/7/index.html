Moreover Yahweh tells you that Yahweh will make you a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When your days are fulfilled, and you will sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, that will proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will be his father, and he will be my son: if he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but my loving-kindness will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And your house and your kingdom will be made sure forever before you: your throne will be established forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then David the king went in, and sat before Yahweh; and he said, Who am I, O Sovereign Yahweh, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this was yet a small thing in your eyes, O Sovereign Yahweh; but you have spoken also of your slave's house for a great while to come; and this is the law of man, O Sovereign Yahweh!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And what more can David say to you? For you know your slave, O Sovereign Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For your word's sake, and according to your own heart, you have wrought all this greatness, to make your slave know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore you are great, O Yahweh God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God besides you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And what other nation on earth is like your people Israel, whose God went and redeemed a people for himself, and made a name for himself, and did great and awesome things for you{+} to drive out nations and their gods before your people, whom you redeemed to yourself from Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you established to yourself your people Israel to be a people to you forever; and you, Yahweh, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And now, O Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your slave, and concerning his house, confirm it forever, and do as you have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And let your name be magnified forever, saying, Yahweh of hosts is God over Israel; and the house of your slave David will be established before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For you, O Yahweh of hosts, the God of Israel, have revealed to your slave, saying, I will build you a house: therefore has your slave found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, O Sovereign Yahweh, you are God, and your words are truth, and you have promised this good thing to your slave:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>now therefore let it please you to bless the house of your slave, that it may continue forever before you; for you, O Sovereign Yahweh, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your slave be blessed forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
