And David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was so, that, when those who bore the ark of Yahweh had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David danced before Yahweh with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of Yahweh with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw King David leaping and dancing before Yahweh; and she despised him in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they brought in the ark of Yahweh, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of hosts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to everyone a cake of bread, and a portion [of flesh], and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed every one to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the female slaves of his slaves, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And David said to Michal, [It was] before Yahweh, who chose me above your father, and above all his house, to appoint me leader over the people of Yahweh, over Israel: therefore I will play before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in my sight: but of the female slaves of whom you have spoken, of them I will be honored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
