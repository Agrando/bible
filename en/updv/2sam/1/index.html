And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel I have escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And David said to him, How did it go? I pray you, tell me. And he answered, The people fled from the battle, and many of the people also fell and have died; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And David said to the young man that told him, How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance on mount Gilboa, I saw that Saul was leaning on his spear; and that the chariots and the horsemen stuck [close] to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said to me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, Stand, I pray you, beside me, and slay me; for anguish has taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after he fell: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men who were with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until evening, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Yahweh, and for the house of Israel; because they fell by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to the young man that told him, Where are you from? And he answered, I am the son of a man who is a sojourner, an Amalekite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David said to him, Why weren't you afraid to put forth your hand to destroy Yahweh's anointed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. And he struck him, so that he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain Yahweh's anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he bade them teach the sons of Judah, The Bow. Look, it is written in the Book of Jashar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Your glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places! How are the mighty fallen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Don't tell it in Gath, Don't proclaim the news in the streets of Ashkelon; Or else the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, Or else the daughters of the uncircumcised will triumph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You{+} mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain on you{+}, neither fields of offerings: For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan didn't turn back, And the sword of Saul didn't return empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, And in their death they were not divided: They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You{+} daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you{+} in scarlet delicately, Who put ornaments of gold on your{+} apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan is slain on your high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: Very pleasant you have been to me: Your love to me was wonderful, Passing the love of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
