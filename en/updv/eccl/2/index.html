[Even] that which has been done long ago.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wise man's eyes are in his head, and the fool walks in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happens to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I said in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it will happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance forever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. And how the wise man dies even as the fool!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous to me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I hated all my labor in which I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it to man who will be after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over all my labor in which I have labored, and in which I have shown myself wise under the sun. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor in which I had labored under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For there is man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet to man who has not labored in it he will leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what has man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, in which he labors under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his days are [but] sorrows, and his travail is grief; yes, even in the night his heart takes no rest. This also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Is it not good that man should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor? This also I saw, that it is from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For to [the] man who pleases him [God] gives wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
