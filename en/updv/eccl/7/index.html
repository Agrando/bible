For you do not inquire wisely concerning this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Wisdom is as good as an inheritance; yes, more excellent is it for those who see the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For wisdom is a defense, even as money is a defense; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider; yes, God has made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out anything [that will be] after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All this I have seen in my days of vanity: there is a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs [his life] in his evildoing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Don't be overly righteous; neither make yourself overly wise: why should you destroy yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Don't be overly wicked, neither be foolish: why should you die before your time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>It is good that you should take hold of this; yes, also from that do not withdraw your hand: for he who fears God will come forth from them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely there is not [a] righteous man on earth, that does good, and does not sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also don't take heed to all words that are spoken, lest you hear your slave curse you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>for oftentimes also your own heart knows that you yourself likewise have cursed others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All this I have proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>That which is, is far off and exceedingly deep; who can find it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I turned about, and my heart [was set] to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason [of things], and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, [and] whose hands are bindings: whoever pleases God will escape from her; but the sinner will be taken by her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Look, this I have found, says the Preacher, [laying] one thing to another, to find out the account;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>which my soul still seeks, but I have not found: of man one among a thousand I have found; but a woman among all those I have not found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Look, this only I have found: that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
