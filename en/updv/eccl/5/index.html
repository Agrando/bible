There is a king to [protect] the cultivated field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loves silver will not be satisfied with silver; nor he who loves abundance, with increase: this also is vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When goods increase, those who eat them are increased; and what advantage is there to the owner of them, except for looking at [them] with his eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The sleep of a laboring man is sweet, whether he eats little or much; but the fullness of the rich will not allow him to sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>There is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun, [namely], riches kept by their owner to his hurt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and those riches perish by evil adventure; and if he has begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As he came forth from his mother's womb, naked he will go again as he came, and will take nothing for his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came, so he will go: and what profit does he have that he labors for the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All his days also he eats in darkness, and he is intensely vexed, and has sickness and wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look, that which I have seen to be good and to be beautiful is for one to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labor, in which he labors under the sun, all the days of his life which God has given him: for this is his portion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All among man also to whom God has given riches and wealth, and has given him power to eat of it, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labor--this is the gift of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For he will not remember much the days of his life; because God answers [him] in the joy of his heart.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
