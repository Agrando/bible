Truly I say to you{+}, There will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be? And what [will be] the sign of your coming, and of the very end of the age?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man leads you{+} astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For many will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and will lead many astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you{+} will hear of wars and rumors of wars; see that you{+} are not troubled: for [these things] must surely come to pass; but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in diverse places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But all these things are the beginning of travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But beware of men: for they will deliver you{+} up to Sanhedrins, and in their synagogues they will scourge you{+};</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>yes and before governors and kings you{+} will be brought for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they deliver you{+} up, don't be anxious how or what you{+} will speak: for it will be given you{+} in that hour what you{+} will speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is not you{+} who speak, but the Spirit of your{+} Father who speaks in you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child: and children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you{+} will be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When therefore you{+} see the detestable thing of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who nurse in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And pray{+} that your{+} flight not be in the winter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for then will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor will ever be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And except those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved: but for the elect's sake those days will be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if any man will say to you{+}, Look, here is the Christ, or, Look, there; don't believe [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For there will arise false Christs, and false prophets, and will show great signs and wonders; so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But take{+} heed: I have told you{+} all things beforehand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give her light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And then he will send forth the angels, and will gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now from the fig tree learn her parable: when her branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you{+} know that the summer is near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>even so you{+} also, when you{+} see all these things, you{+} know that he is near, [even] at the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Truly I say to you{+}, This generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
