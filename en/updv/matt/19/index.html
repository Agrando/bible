If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine, and go to search for that which goes astray?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you{+}, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety and nine which have not gone astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I say to you{+}, that even so there will be joy in heaven over one sinner that repents, [more] than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said, A certain man had two sons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of [your] substance that falls to me. And he divided to them his living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he went and stuck [close] to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to shepherd swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he desired to have filled his belly with the pods that the swine ate: and no man gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when he came to himself he said, How many hired workers of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I am no more worthy to be called your{+} son: make me as one of your hired workers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he arose, and came to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But while he was yet far off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in your sight: I am no more worthy to be called your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the father said to his slaves, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and sandals on his feet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and bring the fatted calf, [and] kill it, and let us eat, and make merry:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he called to him one of the [household] slaves, and inquired what these things might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safe and sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he answered and said to his father, Look, these many years I serve you as a slave, and I never transgressed a commandment of yours; and [yet] you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but when this your son came, who has devoured your living with prostitutes, you killed for him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to him, Child, you are ever with me, and all that is mine is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this your brother was dead, and is alive [again]; and [was] lost, and is found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
