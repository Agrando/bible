And his [young] slave was healed in that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when John heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent through his disciples</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said to him, Are you he who comes, or do we look for another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Go and tell John the things which you{+} hear and see:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>the blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And blessed is he, whoever will find no occasion of stumbling in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as these went their way, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What did you{+} go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed shaken with the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But what did you{+} go out to see? A man clothed in soft [raiment]? Look, those who wear soft [raiment] are in kings' houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But why did you{+} go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you{+}, and much more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This is he, of whom it is written, Look, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Truly I say to you{+}, Among those who are born of women there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet, he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces, who call to their fellows</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and say, We piped to you{+}, and you{+} did not dance; we wailed, and you{+} did not mourn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Look, a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! And wisdom is acknowledged as right by her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the middle [of those present], and pleased Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she, being put forward by her mother, says, Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And being grieved, the king, because of his oaths and because of those who sat to eat with him, he commanded it to be given;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the girl: and she brought it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And his disciples came, and took up the corpse, and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Jesus came into a house. And the multitude came together, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, look, his mother and his brothers stood outside, seeking to speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And one said to him, Look, your mother and your brothers stand outside, seeking to speak to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? And who are my brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And looking on those around him, he said, Here are my mother and my brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For whoever will do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
