And they immediately left the nets, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, preparing their nets; and he called them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And they immediately left the boat and their father, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they go into Capernaum; and right away on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as [one] having authority, and not as their scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And right away there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>saying, What do we have to do with you, Jesus you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold your peace, and come out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the report of him went out right away everywhere into all the region around Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Jesus came into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose, and served him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when evening came, they brought to him many possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits and healed all who were sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there came to him a leper. And he fell on his face, and implored him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be made clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus says to him, See you tell no man; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy, Child, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And look, certain of the scribes said to themselves, This man blasphemes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus seeing their thoughts said, Why do you{+} think evil in your{+} hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that you{+} may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--then he says to the sick of the palsy, Arise, and take up your bed, and go up to your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he arose, and departed to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the multitudes saw it, they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Jesus passed by from there, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he says to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, as he sat to eat in the house, look, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to his disciples, Why does your{+} Teacher eat with the publicans and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when he heard it, he said, Those who are whole have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I didn't come to call the righteous, but sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the disciples of John come to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And no man puts a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment; for that which should fill it up takes from the garment, and a worse tear is made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Neither do [men] put new wine into old wineskins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins perish: but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
