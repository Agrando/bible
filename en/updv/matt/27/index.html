And Jesus said, You say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Pilate says to him, Don't you hear how many things they witness against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marveled greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now at the feast the governor would usually release to the multitude one prisoner, whom they wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom do you{+} want that I release to you{+}? Barabbas or Jesus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said, Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Pilate says to them, What then shall I do to Jesus? They all say, Let him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus he scourged and delivered to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium, and gathered to him the whole battalion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head; and they knelt down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: they compelled him to go [with them], that he might bear his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they offered him wine mingled with gall: but he did not receive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they sat and watched him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then there are crucified with him two robbers, one on the right and one on the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And those who passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and saying, You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days: save yourself, if you are the Son of God, and come down from the cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>In like manner also the chief priests mocking [him], with the scribes and elders, said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He saved others; himself he can't save. He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He trusts on God; let him deliver [him] now, if he desires him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the robbers also who were crucified with him cast on him the same reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? That is, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And some of them stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calls Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the rest said, Let [him] be; let us see whether Elijah comes to save him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And look, the veil of the temple was rent from top to bottom in two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now the captain who was watching Jesus, when he saw what happened, said, Truly this was the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many women were there watching from far, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when evening came, there came a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting across from the tomb.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
