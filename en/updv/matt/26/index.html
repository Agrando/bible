Look, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Arise, let us be going: look, he is at hand that delivers me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And while he yet spoke, look, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now he that delivered him up gave them a sign, saying, Whomever I will kiss, that is he: take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And right away he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And look, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus says to him, Return your sword to its place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Jesus said to the multitudes, Have you{+} come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you{+} did not take me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But all this has come to pass, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those who had taken Jesus led him away to [the house of] Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Peter followed him from far off, to the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the attendants, to see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin sought witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they did not find it, though many false witnesses came. But afterward, two came forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the high priest stood up, and said to him, Do you answer nothing? What is it which these witness against you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him, Tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jesus said to him, You have said. And you{+} will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He has spoken blasphemy: what further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you{+} have heard the blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>What do you{+} think? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then they spat in his face and buffeted him. And some struck him with the palms of their hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>saying, Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is he that struck you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now Peter was sitting outside in the court: and a female slave came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he denied before them all, saying, I don't know what you say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he had gone out into the porch, another [female slave] saw him, and she says to those who were there, This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And again he denied with an oath, I don't know the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And after a little while those who stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth you also are [one] of them; for your speech makes you known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he began to curse and to swear, I don't know the man. And right away the rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the rooster crows, you will deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
