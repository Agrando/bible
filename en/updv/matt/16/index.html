Isn't life more than food, and body than clothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Look at the birds of the heaven, that they do not sow, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; and your{+} heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you{+} of much more value then they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And which of you{+} by being anxious can add one cubit to the measure of his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And why are you{+} anxious concerning clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they do not toil, neither do they spin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>yet I say to you{+}, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is [here], and tomorrow is cast into the oven, [will he] not much more [clothe] you{+}, O you{+} of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore don't be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? Or, What shall we drink? Or, With what shall we be clothed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For after all these things the Gentiles seek; for your{+} heavenly Father knows that you{+} have need of all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But seek{+} first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things will be added to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust consume, and where thieves break through and steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let your{+} loins be girded about, and your{+} lamps burning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and be{+} yourselves like men looking for their lord, when he will return from the marriage feast; that, when he comes and knocks, they may right away open to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Blessed are those slaves, whom the lord when he comes will find watching: truly I say to you{+}, that he will gird himself, and make them sit down to meat, and will come and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if he will come in the second watch, and if in the third, and find [them] so, blessed are those [slaves].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore you{+} also be ready; for in an hour that you{+} do not think the Son of Man comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Who then is the faithful and wise slave, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Blessed is that slave, whom his lord when he comes will find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Truly I say to you{+}, that he will set him over all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if that evil slave says in his heart, My lord tarries;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and begins to beat his fellow slaves, and to eat and drink, and to be drunk;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>the lord of that slave will come in a day when he does not expect, and in an hour when he does not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and will cut him apart, and appoint his portion with the unfaithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For as [were] the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For as in those days which were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they didn't know until the flood came, and took them all away; so also will be the coming of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then will two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>two women [will be] grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he went on his way through cities and villages, teaching, and journeying on to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
