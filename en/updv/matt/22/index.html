And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus entered into the temple, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold the doves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he says to them, It is written, My house will be called a house of prayer: but you{+} make it a den of robbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when evening came they went forth out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Peter calling to remembrance says to him, Rabbi, look, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jesus answering says to them, Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly I say to you{+}, Whoever will say to this mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea; and will not doubt in his heart, but will believe that what he says comes to pass; he will have it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore I say to you{+}, All things that you{+} pray and ask for, believe that you{+} receive them, and you{+} will have them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you do these things? And who gave you this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you{+} one question, which if you{+} tell me, I likewise will tell you{+} by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The baptism of John, from where was it? From heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we will say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did you{+} not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if we will say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they answered Jesus, and said, We don't know. He also said to them, Neither do I tell you{+} by what authority I do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he spoke to them in parables, saying, There was a man who was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and dug a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his slaves to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the husbandmen took his slaves, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again, he sent other slaves more than the first: and they did to them in like manner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But afterward he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they took him, and killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Have you{+} not read even this Scripture, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner; This was from Yahweh, And it is marvelous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when they heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
