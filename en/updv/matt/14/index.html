And he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the workers are few. Pray{+} therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth workers into his harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Go your{+} ways; Look, I send you{+} forth as sheep among wolves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Carry neither wallet, nor bag, nor sandals:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>for the worker is worthy of his food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And into whatever city or village you{+} will enter, search out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you{+} go forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And as you{+} enter into the house, greet it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the house is worthy, let your{+} peace come upon it: but if it is not worthy, let your{+} peace return to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who receives you{+} receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And whoever will not receive you{+}, nor hear your{+} words, as you{+} go forth out of that house or that city, shake off the dust of your{+} feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly I say to you{+}, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works were done, because they did not repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you{+}, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I say to you{+}, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will go down to Hades.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, I watched Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look, I have given you{+} authority to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing will in any wise hurt you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nevertheless don't rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you{+}; but rejoice that your{+} names are written in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you hid these things from the wise and understanding, and revealed them to juveniles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in your sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things have been delivered to me of my Father: and no one knows the Son, except the Father; neither does any know the Father, except the Son, and he to whomever the Son wills to reveal [him.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And turning to the disciples, he said, Blessed [are] the eyes which see the things that you{+} see; and the ears which hear the things that you{+} hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For truly I say to you{+}, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which you{+} see, and did not see them; and to hear the things which you{+} hear, and did not hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came to pass, as he was praying in a certain place, that when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, When you{+} pray, say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, Hallowed be your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Your kingdom come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give us this day our daily bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And don't bring us into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I say to you{+}, Ask, and it will be given to you{+}; Seek, and you{+} will find; Knock, and it will be opened to you{+}:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For everyone who asks receives; and He who seeks finds; and To him who knocks it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Or what man is there of you{+}, who, if his son will ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>or if he will ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If you{+} then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your{+} children, how much more will your{+} Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
