For they don't wash their hands when they eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he answered and said to them, Why do you{+} also transgress the commandment of God because of your{+} tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God said, Honor your father and your mother: and, He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you{+} say, whoever will say to his father or his mother, That with which you might have been profited by me is given [to God];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he will not honor his father. And you{+} have made void the word of God because of your{+} tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You{+} hypocrites, Isaiah prophesied well of you{+}, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people honors me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in vain they worship me, Teaching [as their] doctrines the precepts of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he called to him the multitude, and said to them, Hear{+}, and understand{+}:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There is nothing from outside the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then his disciples asked of him the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, Are you{+} so without understanding also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Don't you{+} perceive, that whatever from outside goes into the man, [it] can't defile him; because it does not go into his heart, but into his belly, and goes out into the latrine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For from inside, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, greed, wickednesses, deceit, sexual immorality, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>all these evil things proceed from inside, and defile the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A good tree is not able to produce evil fruit, neither is a corrupt tree [able] to produce good fruit: for the tree is known by its fruit. For men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor do they gather figs of thistles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The good man out of his good treasure brings forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And look, a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet. Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And she implored him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But she answered and says to him, Lord, even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to her, For this saying go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And she went away to her house, and found the child laid on the bed, and the demon gone out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, maimed, mute, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed whole, and lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus called to him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I don't want to send them away fasting, lest perhaps they faint on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the disciples say to him, From where should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you{+} have? And they said, Seven, and a few small fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and he took the seven loaves and the fish; and he gave thanks and broke, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and trying him asked him to show them a sign from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But he answered and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and there will no sign be given to it, but the sign of Jonah. And he left them, and departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the disciples came to the other side and forgot to take bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, We took no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Jesus perceiving it said, O you{+} of little faith, why do you{+} reason among yourselves, because you{+} have no bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Do you{+} not yet perceive, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you{+} took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets you{+} took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>How is it that you{+} do not perceive that I did not speak to you{+} concerning bread? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
