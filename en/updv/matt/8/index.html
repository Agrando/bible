This is he who was sown by the wayside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he who was sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word, and right away with joy receives it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>yet he does not have root in himself, but endures for awhile; and when tribulation or persecution rises because of the word, right away he stumbles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he who was sown among the thorns, this is he who hears the word; and the care of the age, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he who was sown on the good ground, this is he who hears the word, and understands it; who truly bears fruit, and brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He set another parable before the multitudes, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed weeds also among the wheat, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the weeds also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the slaves of the householder came and said to him, Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? From where then has it weeds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, A hostile man has done this. And the slaves say to him, Will you then that we go and gather them up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he says, No; lest perhaps while you{+} gather up the weeds, you{+} root up the wheat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the weeds, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Another parable he set before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in its branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Another parable he spoke to them; The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until it was all leavened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the multitudes; and without a parable he spoke nothing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the weeds are the sons of the evil [one];</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the very end of the age; and the reapers are angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>As therefore the weeds are gathered up and burned with fire; so it will be in the very end of the age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Son of Man will send forth his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and will cast them into the furnace of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then will the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
