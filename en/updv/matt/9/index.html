Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he came to the other side into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him a man possessed with demons coming forth out of the tombs who was so strong that no man could bind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus said to him, Come forth, you unclean spirit, out of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he cried out, saying, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I urge you, don't torment me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jesus asked him, What is your name?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he says to him, My name is Legion; for we are many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now there was far off from them a herd of many swine being shepherded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they implored him, saying, If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to them, Go. And they came out, and went into the swine: and look, the whole herd rushed down the steep into the sea, and perished in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And those who shepherded them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, and what was befallen to him who was possessed with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And look, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they implored [him] that he would depart from their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he entered into a boat, and crossed over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And there came a ruler, and fell at his feet, saying, My daughter is at the point of death: come and lay your hands on her, and she will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus arose, and followed him, and [so did] his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And look, a woman, who had a discharge of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for she said to herself, If I do but touch his garment, I will be made whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; your faith has made you whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>he said, Do not weep; for the girl is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the girl arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the news of this went forth into all that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother called Mary? And his brothers, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And his sisters, are they not all with us? From where then has this man all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
