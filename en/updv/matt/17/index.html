And he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Strive to enter in by the narrow door: for many, I say to you{+}, will seek to enter in, and will not be able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>When once the master of the house has risen up, and has shut to the door, and you{+} begin to stand outside, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he will answer and say to you{+}, I don't know you{+} or where you{+} are from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then you{+} will begin to say, We ate and drank in your presence, and you taught in our streets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and he will speak, saying to you{+}, I don't know you{+} or where you{+} are from; depart from me, all you{+} workers of iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Everyone therefore that hears these words of mine, and does them, will be likened to a wise man, who built his house on the rock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it did not fall: for it was founded on the rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And everyone who hears these words of mine, and does not do them, will be likened to a foolish man, who built his house on the sand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and struck against that house; and it fell: and great was its fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I say to you{+}, that many will come from the east and the west, and will sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but the sons of the kingdom will be cast forth into the outer darkness: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get out, and go from here: for Herod wants to kill you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to them, Go and say to that fox, Look, I cast out demons and perform cures today and tomorrow, and the third [day] I am perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nevertheless I must go on my way today and tomorrow and the [day] following: for it cannot be that a prophet perishes out of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, that kills the prophets, and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you{+} did not want [to]!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Look, your{+} house is left to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I say to you{+}, You{+} will not see me from now on, until you{+} will say, Blessed [is] he who comes in the name of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, when he went into the house of one of the rulers of the Pharisees on a Sabbath to eat bread, that they were watching him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And look, there was before him a certain man who had the dropsy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus answering spoke to the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let him go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, What man will there be of you{+}, that will have one sheep, and if this falls into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they could not answer again to these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he spoke a parable to those who were invited, when he marked how they chose out the chief seats; saying to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When you are invited of any man to a marriage feast, don't sit down in the chief seat; lest perhaps a more honorable man than you be invited of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he who invited you and him will come and say to you, Give this man place; and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when you are invited, go and sit down in the lowest place; that when he who has invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher: then you will have glory in the presence of all who sit at meat with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled; and he who humbles himself will be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said to him also that had invited him, When you make a dinner or a supper, do not call your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors; lest perhaps they also bid you again, and a recompense be made you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But when you make a feast, bid the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and you will be blessed; because they don't have [the means] to recompense you: for you will be recompensed in the resurrection of the just.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when one of those who sat to eat with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he who will eat bread in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But he said to him, A certain man made a great supper; and he invited many:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and he sent forth his slave at supper time to say to those who were invited, Come; for [all] things are now ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they all with one [consent] began to make excuses. The first said to him, I have bought a field, and I must surely go out and see it; I pray you have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray you have me excused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I can't come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the slave came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his slave, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and maimed and blind and lame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the slave said, Lord, what you commanded is done, and yet there is room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the lord said to the slave, Go out into the highways and hedges, and constrain [them] to come in, that my house may be filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I say to you{+}, that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
