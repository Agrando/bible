For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they went away in the boat to a desert place apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And [the people] saw them going, and many knew [them], and they ran together there on foot from all the cities, and outwent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he came forth and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when evening came, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go away; you{+} give them to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they say to him, We have here but five loaves, and two fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Bring them here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And having commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fish, [and] having looked up to heaven, he blessed. And having broken the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and the disciples [gave] to the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And right away he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, until he should send the multitudes away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when evening came, he was there alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the boat was now a long distance away from the land, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying Be of good cheer; it is I; don't be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he got up into the boat, the wind ceased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, to Gennesaret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all around that region, and brought to him all who were sick,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and they implored him that they might only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
