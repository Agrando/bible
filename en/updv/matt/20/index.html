Render the account of your stewardship; for you can no longer be steward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the steward said to himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord takes away the stewardship from me? I don't have strength to dig; I am ashamed to beg.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I have resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe to my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then he said to another, And how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He says to him, Take your bond, and write eighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this age are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you{+}, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it will fail, they may receive you{+} into the eternal tabernacles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he who is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If therefore you{+} haven't been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your{+} trust the true [riches]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if you{+} haven't been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you{+} that which is your{+} own?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No man can serve as a slave to two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or he will hold to one, and despise the other. You{+} can't serve as a slave to God and mammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, You{+} are those who justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knows your{+} hearts: for that which is exalted among men is disgusting in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If therefore they will say to you{+}, Look, he is in the wilderness; don't go forth: Look, he is in the inner chambers; don't believe [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For as the lightning comes forth from the east, and is seen even to the west; so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose from there and comes into the borders of Judea and beyond the Jordan: and multitudes come together to him again; and, as he was accustomed, he taught them again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to divorce [his] wife? trying him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he answered and said to them, What did Moses command you{+}?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they said, Moses allowed to write a bill of divorce, and to divorce.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Jesus said to them, For your{+} hardness of heart he wrote you{+} this commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But from the beginning of the creation, Male and female he made them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this cause will a man leave his father and mother, and will stick to his wife;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the two will become one flesh: so that they are no more two, but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>What therefore God has joined together, don't let man separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And in the house the disciples asked him again of this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he says to them, Everyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then there were brought to him little children, that he should touch them: and the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But Jesus said, Allow the little children to come to me, and don't forbid them: for to such belongs the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Truly I say to you{+}, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he will in no way enter in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as he was going forth into the way, one ran to him, and knelt to him, and asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? None is good but one, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>You know the commandments, Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said to him, Teacher, all these things I have observed from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jesus looking on him loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: go, sell whatever you have, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But his countenance fell at the saying, and he went away sorrowful: for he was one who had great possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus looked around, and says to his disciples, How hardly will those who have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus answers again, and says to them, Children, how hard it is to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they were exceedingly astonished, saying to themselves, Then who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Jesus looking on them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Peter began to say to him, Look, we have left all, and have followed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Jesus said, Truly I say to you{+}, There is no man who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for the sake of me, and for the sake of the good news,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>but he [who] will receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the age to come eternal life. But many [who are] first will be last; and the last first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
