Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus perceived their hypocrisy, and said, Why do you{+} make trial of me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Show me the tribute money. And they brought to him a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he says to them, Whose is this image and superscription?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They say to him, Caesar's. Then he says to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when they heard it, they marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came to him Sadducees, those who say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>saying, Teacher, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother will marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed, left his wife to his brother;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>in like manner the second also, and the third, to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after them all, the woman died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>In the resurrection therefore whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus answered and said to them, Is it not for this cause that you{+} err, that you{+} don't know the Scriptures, nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But as concerning the dead, that they are raised; have you{+} not read in the Book of Moses, in [the place concerning] the Bush, how God spoke to him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not [the God] of the dead, but of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And one of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together, and having seeing that he answered them well, asked him, What commandment is the first of all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jesus answered, The first is, Hear, O Israel; Yahweh our God, Yahweh is one:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and you will love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The second is this, You will love your fellow man as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And no man after that dared ask him any question.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, How do the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>David himself said in the Holy Spirit, Yahweh said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, Until I set your enemies under your feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>David himself calls him Lord; and how is he his son? And the large crowd heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and [to have] salutations in the marketplaces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>those who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers; these will receive greater condemnation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
