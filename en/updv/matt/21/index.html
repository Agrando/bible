And immediately he received his sight, and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he entered and was passing through Jericho.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And look, a man called by name Zacchaeus; and he was a chief publican, and he was rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he ran on before, and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he came to the place, Jesus looked up, and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry, and come down; for today I must stay at your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he hurried, and came down, and received him joyfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a man who is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord, Look, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wrongfully exacted anything of any man, I restore fourfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus said to him, Today has salvation come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and [because] they supposed that the kingdom of God was immediately to appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he called ten slaves of his, and gave them $10,000, and said to them, Trade{+} until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But his citizens hated him, and sent an ambassador after him, saying, We will not have this man reign over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass, when he came back again, having received the kingdom, that he commanded these slaves, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by trading.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the first came before him, saying, Lord, your $1,000 has made $10,000 more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to him, Well done, you good slave: because you were found faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the second came, saying, Your $1,000, Lord, has made $5,000.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to him also, You also be over five cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And another came, saying, Lord, look, [here is] your $1,000, which I kept laid up in a napkin:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for I feared you, because you are an austere man: you take up that which you did not lay down, and reap that which you did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He says to him, Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked slave. You knew that I am an austere man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>then why didn't you give my money into the bank, and I at my coming should have collected it with interest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he said to those who stood by, Take away from him the $1,000, and give it to him who has the $10,000.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said to him, Lord, he has $10,000.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I say to you{+}, that to everyone who has will be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But these enemies of mine, that did not want that I should reign over them, bring here, and slay them before me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
