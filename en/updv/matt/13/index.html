How long shall I bear with you{+}? Bring him here to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus rebuked him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And while they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man will be delivered up into the hands of men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and they will kill him, and the third day he will be raised up. And they were exceedingly sorry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them might be the greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Jesus knowing the reasoning of their heart, took a little child, and set him by his side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said to them, Whoever will receive this little child in my name receives me: and whoever will receive me receives him who sent me: for he who is least among all of you{+}, the same is great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But whoever will cause one of these little ones to stumble, it is profitable for him that a great millstone should be hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe to him, through whom the occasion comes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having your two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off: it is good for you to enter into life lame, rather than having your two feet to be cast into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out: it is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there came a scribe, and said to him, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven [have] nests; but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jesus says to him, Follow me; and leave the dead to bury their own dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
