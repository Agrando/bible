Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the Son of Man will come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he will render to each man according to his activity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Truly I say to you{+}, there are some of those who stand here, who will in no way taste of death, until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he was transfigured before them; and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And look, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah talking with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Peter answered, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here: if you will, I will make here three tabernacles; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was yet speaking, look, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and look, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear{+} him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And then they saw no one, except Jesus only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, except when the Son of Man should have risen again from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they asked him, saying, [How is it] that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, Elijah indeed comes first, and restores all things: and how is it written of the Son of Man, that he should suffer many things and be set at nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say to you{+}, that Elijah has come, and they have also done to him whatever they would, even as it is written of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
