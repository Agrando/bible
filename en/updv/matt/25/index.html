For she has worked a good work on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For you{+} always have the poor with you{+}; but me you{+} do not always have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For in that she poured this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Truly I say to you{+}, Wherever this good news will be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman has done will be spoken of for a memorial of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him [to them.]</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now on the first [day] of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do you want us to make ready for you to eat the Passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is at hand; I keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now when evening came, he was sitting at meat with the twelve;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and as they were eating, he said, Truly I say to you{+}, that one of you{+} will deliver me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and began to say to him each one, Is it I, Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he answered and said, He who dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same will deliver me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Son of Man goes, even as it is written of him: but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is delivered up! Good were it for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say to you{+}, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you{+} in my Father's kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then came to him the sons of Zebedee, asking a certain thing of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, What do you{+} want? They say to him, Say that we may sit, one at your right hand, and one at your left hand, in your kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Jesus answered and said, You{+} don't know what you{+} ask. Are you{+} able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They say to him, We are able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He says to them, My cup indeed you{+} will drink: but to sit at my right hand, and on [my] left hand, this is not mine to give; but [it is for those] for whom it has been prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation concerning the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But Jesus called them to him, and said, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and those who have authority over them are called Benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But you{+} [will] not [be] so: but he who is the greater among you{+}, let him become as the younger; and he who is chief, as he who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For which is greater, he who sits at meat, or he who serves? Isn't it he who sits at meat? But I am among you{+} as he who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But you{+} are those who have continued with me in my trials;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and I appoint to you{+}, even as my Father appointed to me, a kingdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that you{+} may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and you{+} will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then Jesus says to them, All you{+} will be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Peter answered and said to him, If all will be offended in you, I will never be offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me thrice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Peter says to him, Even if I must die with you, [yet] I will not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
