[How] has the most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Even the jackals draw out the breast, they nurse their young ones: The daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The tongue of the nursing child sticks to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaks it to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Those who did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: Those who were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their visage is blacker than a charcoal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin shrivels to their bones; it is withered, it has become like a stick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Those who are slain with the sword are better than those who are slain with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yahweh has accomplished his wrath, he has poured out his fierce anger; And he has kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured its foundations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The kings of the earth did not believe, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>[It is] because of the sins of her prophets, [and] the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men can't touch their garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Depart{+}, they cried to them, Unclean! Depart, depart, don't touch! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They will no more sojourn [here].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The anger of Yahweh has scattered them; he will no more regard them: They did not respect the persons of the priests, they did not favor the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Our eyes do yet fail [in looking] for our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They hunt our steps, so that we can't go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens: They chased us on the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Yahweh, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we will live among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz: The cup will pass through to you also; you will be drunk, and will make yourself naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry you away into captivity: He will visit your iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover your sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
