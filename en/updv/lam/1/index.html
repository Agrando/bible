She has become as a widow, that was great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces has become slave labor!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>She weeps intensely in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; Among all her friends she has none to comfort her: All her companions have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude; She dwells among the nations, she finds no rest: All her persecutors overtook her inside the straits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The ways of Zion mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly; All her gates are desolate, her priests sigh: Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Her adversaries have become the head, her enemies prosper; For Yahweh has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: Her young children have gone into captivity before the adversary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty has departed: Her princes have become like harts that find no pasture, And they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her wandering all her pleasant things that were from the days of old: When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none helped her, The adversaries saw her, they mocked at her desolations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she has become as an unclean thing; All who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: Yes, she sighs, and turns backward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Her filthiness was in her skirts; she didn't remember her latter end; Therefore she has come down wonderfully; she has no comforter: See, O Yahweh, my affliction; for the enemy has magnified himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The adversary has spread out his hand on all her pleasant things: For she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary, Concerning whom you commanded that they should not enter into your assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>All her people sigh, they seek bread; They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul: See, O Yahweh, and behold; for I have become abject.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is it nothing to you{+}, all you{+} who pass by? Look, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought on me, With which Yahweh has afflicted [me] in the day of his fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From on high he has sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them; He has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: He has made me desolate and faint all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The yoke of my transgressions is tied by his hand; They are knit together, they have come up on my neck; he has made my strength to fail: The Lord has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The Lord has set at nothing all my mighty men in the midst of me; He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men: The Lord has trodden as in a wine press the virgin daughter of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runs down with water; Because the comforter that should refresh my soul is far from me: My sons are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Zion spreads forth her hands; there is none to comfort her; Yahweh has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are round about him should be his adversaries: Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yahweh is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: Hear, I pray you{+}, all you{+} peoples, and look at my sorrow: My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I called for my lovers, [but] they deceived me: My priests and my elders gave up the ghost in the city, While they sought food for them to refresh their souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Look, O Yahweh; for I am in distress; my insides are troubled; My heart is turned inside me; for I have grievously rebelled: Abroad the sword bereaves, at home there is as death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They have heard that I sigh; there is none to comfort me; All my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that you have done it: You have brought the day that you have proclaimed, and they will be like me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let all their wickedness come before you; And do to them, as you have done to me for all my transgressions: For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
