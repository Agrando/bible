he has broken my bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He has built against me, and surrounded me with gall and travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those who have been long dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He has walled me about, that I can't go forth; he has made my chain heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He has walled up my ways with cut stone; he has made my paths crooked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have become a derision for my whole nation, and their song all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered me with ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you have removed my soul far off from peace; I forgot prosperity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I said, My strength has perished, and my expectation from Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and the gall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>My soul has them still in remembrance, and is bowed down inside me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This I recall to my mind; therefore I have hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>[It is of] Yahweh's loving-kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions do not fail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yahweh is my portion, says my soul; therefore I will hope in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul who seeks him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is good for a [noble] man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Let him sit alone and keep silent, because he has laid it on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let him put his mouth in the dust, if perhaps there may be hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; let him be filled full with reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For the Lord will not cast off forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For though he causes grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the sons of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>To turn aside the right of a [noble] man before the face of the Most High,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>To subvert man in his cause, the Lord does not approve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Who is he that says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord does not command it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Out of the mouth of the Most High does there not come evil and good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Why does man complain, a living [noble] man for the punishment of his sins?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>We have transgressed and have rebelled; you have not pardoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You have covered with anger and pursued us; you have slain, you have not pitied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Fear and the pit have come upon us, devastation and destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>My eye pours down, and does not cease, without any intermission,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Until Yahweh looks down, and beholds from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They have chased me intensely like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>I called on your name, O Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>You heard my voice; don't hide your ear at my breathing, at my cry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>You drew near in the day that I called on you; you said, Don't be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>O Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>O Yahweh, you have seen my wrong; judge my cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>You have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>You have heard their reproach, O Yahweh, and all their devices against me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>The lips of those who rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Look at their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>You will render to them a recompense, O Yahweh, according to the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
