Everyone who passes by it will be astonished, and will hiss; and they will say, Why has Yahweh done thus to this land, and to this house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they will answer, Because they forsook Yahweh their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshiped them, and served them: therefore Yahweh has brought all this evil on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of Yahweh and the king's house</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar-trees and fir-trees, and with gold, according to all his desire), that then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they were not right in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this is the reason of the slave labor which King Solomon raised, to build the house of Yahweh, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a portion to his daughter, Solomon's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and all the store-cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build for his pleasure in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the sons of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>their sons who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel were not able completely to destroy, of them Solomon raised slave labor to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Solomon made no slave of the sons of Israel; but they were the men of war, and his slaves, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and of his horsemen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>These were the chief officers who were over Solomon's work, five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people who wrought in the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David to her house which [Solomon] had built for her: then he built Millo.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And three times a year Solomon offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings on the altar which he built to Yahweh, burning incense with it, [on the altar] that was before Yahweh. So he finished the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Hiram sent in the navy his slaves, shipmen who had knowledge of the sea, with the slaves of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they came to Ophir, and fetched from there gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to King Solomon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
