Solomon stuck to these [women] in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart wasn't perfect with Yahweh his God, as was the heart of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the detestable thing of the Ammonites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and did not go fully after Yahweh, as did David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the detestable thing of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the detestable thing of the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed to their gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Yahweh was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from Yahweh, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he did not keep that which Yahweh commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore Yahweh said to Solomon, Since this was done of you, and you haven't kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded you, I will surely rend the kingdom from you, and will give it to your slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Notwithstanding in your days I will not do it, for David your father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of your son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to your son, for David my slave's sake, and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Yahweh raised up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host went up to bury the slain, and had struck every male in Edom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's slaves with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a small lad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him as wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Pharaoh said to him, But what have you lacked with me, that, look, you seek to go to your own country? And he answered, Nothing: nevertheless only let me depart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And God raised up [another] adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he gathered men to him, and became captain over a troop, when David slew them [of Zobah]: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt in it, and reigned in Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad [did]: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a slave of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now [Ahijah] had clad himself with a new garment; and both of them were alone in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to Jeroboam, Take for yourself ten pieces; for this is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, Look, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to you</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(but he will have one tribe, for my slave David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>because they have forsaken me, and have worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and [to keep] my statutes and my ordinances, as did David his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David my slave's sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it to you, even ten tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And to his son I will give one tribe, that David my slave may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And I will take you, and you will reign according to all that your soul desires, and will be king over Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And it will be, if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do that which is right in my eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my slave did; that I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
