Now he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and Zimri went in and struck him, and killed him, in the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he struck all the house of Baasha: he left him not one urinating against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>for all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned, and with which they made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people who were encamped heard it said, Zimri has conspired, and has also struck the king: therefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the castle of the king's house, and burnt the king's house over him with fire, and died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for his sins which he sinned in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the people who followed Omri prevailed against the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, [and reigned] twelve years: six years he reigned in Tirzah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver; and he built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill, Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and dealt wickedly above all who were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sins with which he made Israel to sin, to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger with their vanities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Ahab the son of Omri did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh above all who were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took as wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Ahab made the Asherah; and Ahab did yet more to provoke Yahweh, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>In his days Hiel the Beth-elite built Jericho: he laid its foundation with the loss of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates with the loss of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
