You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to her, Give me your son. And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he dwelt, and laid him on his own bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he cried to Yahweh, and said, O Yahweh my God, have you also brought evil on the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he stretched himself on the child three times, and cried to Yahweh, and said, O Yahweh my God, I pray you, let this child's soul come into him again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Yahweh listened to the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him to his mother; and Elijah said, See, your son lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of Yahweh in your mouth is truth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
