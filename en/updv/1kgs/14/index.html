Now Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Yahweh said to Ahijah, Look, the wife of Jeroboam comes to inquire of you concerning her son; for he is sick: thus and thus you will say to her; for it will be, when she comes in, that she will feign herself to be another woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, you wife of Jeroboam; why feign you yourself to be another? For I am sent to you with difficult news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Go, tell Jeroboam, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: Since I exalted you from among the people, and made you leader over my people Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it you; and yet you haven't been as my slave David, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do only that which was right in my eyes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but have done evil above all who were before you, and have gone and made for yourself other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and have cast me behind your back:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>therefore, look, I will bring evil on the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam [every] one urinating against a wall, whether slave or free in Israel, and will completely sweep away the house of Jeroboam, as a man sweeps away dung, until it is all gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He of Jeroboam that dies in the city, the dogs will eat; and he who dies in the field, the birds of the heavens will eat: for Yahweh has spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You arise therefore, go to your house: [and] when your feet enter into the city, the child will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And all Israel will mourn for him, and bury him; for he only of Jeroboam will come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward Yahweh, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover Yahweh will raise up for himself a king over Israel, who will cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? Even now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For Yahweh will strike Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water; and he will root up Israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers, and will scatter them beyond the River, because they have made their Asherim, provoking Yahweh to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he has sinned, and with which he has made Israel to sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: [and] as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all Israel buried him, and mourned for him, according to the word of Yahweh, which he spoke by his slave Ahijah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, look, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Yahweh had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Judah did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they committed, above all that their fathers had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For they also built themselves high places, and pillars, and Asherim, on every high hill, and under every green tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and there were also homosexuals in the land: they did according to all the disgusting behaviors of the nations which Yahweh drove out before the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and he took away the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And King Rehoboam made in their stead shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the captains of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it was so, that, as often as the king went into the house of Yahweh, the guard bore them, and brought them back into the guard-chamber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David: and his mother's name was Naamah the Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
