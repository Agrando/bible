And he was also a very goodly man; and he was born after Absalom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and those following Adonijah helped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel; and he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's slaves:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he did not call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord does not know it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now therefore come, let me, I pray you, give you counsel, that you may save your own life, and the life of your son Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Go and get in to King David, and say to him, Did you not, my lord, O king, swear to your slave, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Look, while you yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after you, and confirm your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What do you want?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she said to him, My lord, you swore by Yahweh your God to your slave, [saying], Assuredly Solomon your son will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And now, look, Adonijah reigns; and you, my lord the king, do not know it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host; but Solomon your slave he has not called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, that you should tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king will sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, look, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they told the king, saying, Look, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have you said, Adonijah will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he has gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, look, they are eating and drinking before him, and say, [Long] live King Adonijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But me, even me your slave, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your slave Solomon, he has not called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and you have not shown to your slave who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then King David answered and said, Call to me Bathsheba. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the king swore, and said, As Yahweh lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>truly as I swore to you by Yahweh, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon your son will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne in my stead; truly so I will do this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord King David live forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the king said to them, Take with you{+} the slaves of your{+} lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel; and blow{+} the trumpet, and say, [Long] live King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then you{+} will come up after him, and he will come and sit on my throne; for he will be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be leader over Israel and over Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: Yahweh, the God of my lord the king, says so [too].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>As Yahweh has been with my lord the king, even so he will be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the Tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, [Long] live King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>While he yet spoke, look, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said, Come in; for you are a worthy man, and bring good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord King David has made Solomon king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon; and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that you{+} have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And moreover the king's slaves came to bless our lord King David, saying, Your God make the name of Solomon better than your name, and make his throne greater than your throne: and the king bowed himself on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And also thus said the king, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who has given one to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it was told Solomon, saying, Look, Adonijah fears King Solomon; for, look, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not slay his slave with the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, not a hair of him will fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, Go to your house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
