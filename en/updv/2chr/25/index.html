And the man of God answered, Yahweh is able to give you much more than this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Amaziah separated them, [to wit], the army that came to him out of Ephraim, to go home again: therefore their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Amaziah took courage, and led forth his people, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck of the sons of Seir ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sons of Judah carried away alive [another] ten thousand, and brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that all of them were broken in pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the men of the army whom Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell on the cities of Judah, from Samaria even to Beth-horon, and struck of them three thousand, and took much spoil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed down himself before them, and burned incense to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Amaziah, and he sent to him a prophet, who said to him, Why have you sought after the gods of the people, which haven't delivered their own people out of your hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that [the king] said to him, Have we made you of the king's counsel? Forbear; why should you be struck? Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this, and haven't listened to my counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trod down the thistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You say, Look, you have struck Edom; and your heart lifts you up to boast: remain now at home; why should you meddle to [your] hurt, that you should fall, even you, and Judah with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Amaziah would not hear; for it was of God, that he might hand them over, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Joash king of Israel went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And [he took] all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, look, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now from the time that Amaziah turned away from following Yahweh they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and he fled to Lachish: but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they brought him on horses, and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
