And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvelously helped, until he was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up, so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against Yahweh his God; for he went into the temple of Yahweh to burn incense on the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him eighty priests of Yahweh, who were valiant men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said to him, It does not pertain to you, Uzziah, to burn incense to Yahweh, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for you have trespassed; neither will it be for your honor from Yahweh God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Uzziah was angry; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was angry with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead before the priests in the house of Yahweh, beside the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked on him, and saw that he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out quickly from there; yes, he himself hurried also to go out, because Yahweh had struck him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Uzziah the king was a leper to the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh: and Jotham his son was over the king's house, judging the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, wrote.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Uzziah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
