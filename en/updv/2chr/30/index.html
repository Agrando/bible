For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good Yahweh pardon everyone</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>that sets his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, though [he is] not [cleansed] according to the purification of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Israel who were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised Yahweh day by day, [singing] with loud instruments to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah spoke comfortably to all the Levites that had good understanding [in the service] of Yahweh. So they ate throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days; and they kept [another] seven days with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezekiah king of Judah gave to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the Levitical priests arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even to heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
