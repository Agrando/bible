And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abijah joined battle with an army of valiant men of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, who were mighty men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abijah stood up on mount Zemaraim, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, O Jeroboam and all Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Don't you{+} know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom over Israel to David forever, even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the slave of Solomon the son of David, rose up, and rebelled against his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there were gathered to him worthless men, base fellows, that strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And now you{+} think to withstand the kingdom of Yahweh in the hand of the sons of David; and you{+} are a great multitude, and there are with you{+} the golden calves which Jeroboam made you{+} for gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Haven't you{+} driven out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and made for yourselves priests after the manner of the peoples of [other] lands? So that whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams, the same may be a priest of [those that are] no gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But as for us, Yahweh is our God, and we haven't forsaken him; and [we have] priests ministering to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites in their work:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they burn to Yahweh every morning and every evening burnt-offerings and sweet incense: the showbread also [they set] in order on the pure table; and the lampstand of gold with its lamps, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of Yahweh our God; but you{+} have forsaken him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, look, God is with us at our head, and his priests with the trumpets of alarm to sound an alarm against you{+}. O sons of Israel, don't fight{+} against Yahweh, the God of your{+} fathers; for you{+} will not prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them: so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Judah looked back, and saw that the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to Yahweh, and the priests sounded with the trumpets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass, that God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the sons of Israel fled before Judah; and God delivered them into their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus the sons of Israel were brought under at that time, and the sons of Judah prevailed, because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him, Beth-el with its towns, and Jeshanah with its towns, and Ephron with its towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah: and Yahweh struck him, and he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Abijah waxed mighty, and took to himself fourteen wives, and begot twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his sayings, are written in the commentary of the prophet Iddo.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
