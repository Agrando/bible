So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Ahaziah was twenty years old when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: and his mother's name was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab; for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, as did the house of Ahab; for they were his counselors after the death of his father, to his destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He also walked after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead: and the Syrians wounded Joram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which they had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now the destruction of Ahaziah was of God, in that he went to Joram: for when he came, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu the son of Nimshi, whom Yahweh had anointed to cut off the house of Ahab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it came to pass, when Jehu was executing judgment on the house of Ahab, that he found the princes of Judah, and the sons of the brothers of Ahaziah, ministering to Ahaziah, and slew them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (now he was hiding in Samaria), and they brought him to Jehu, and slew him; and they buried him, for they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought Yahweh with all his heart. And the house of Ahaziah had no power to hold the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him away from among the king's sons who were slain, and put him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of King Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah), hid him from Athaliah, so that she did not slay him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he was hid with them in the house of God six years: and Athaliah reigned over the land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
