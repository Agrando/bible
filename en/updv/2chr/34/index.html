And Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and moreover brought back word to the king, saying, All that was committed to your slaves, they are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they have emptied out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh, and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers, and into the hand of the workmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered a book to me. And Shaphan read it before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the law, that he rent his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah the king's slave, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Go{+}, inquire of Yahweh for me, and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that was found; for great is the wrath of Yahweh that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of Yahweh, to do according to all that is written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Hilkiah, and those whom the king [had commanded], went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second quarter;) and they spoke to her to that effect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she said to them, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: Tell{+} the man who sent you{+} to me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus says Yahweh, Look, I will bring evil on this place, and on its inhabitants, even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore is my wrath poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But to the king of Judah, who sent you{+} to inquire of Yahweh, thus you{+} will say to him, This is what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says: As concerning the words which you have heard,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because your heart was tender, and you humbled yourself before God, when you heard his words against this place, and against its inhabitants, and have humbled yourself before me, and have rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Look, I will gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace, neither will your eyes see all the evil that I will bring on this place, and on its inhabitants. And they brought back word to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king went up to the house of Yahweh, and all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, both great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the Book of the Covenant that was found in the house of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then he caused all who were found in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Josiah took away all the disgusting things out of all the countries that pertained to the sons of Israel, and made all who were found in Israel to serve, even to serve Yahweh their God. All his days they did not depart from following Yahweh, the God of their fathers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
