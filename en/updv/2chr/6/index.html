Look, heaven and the heaven of heavens can't contain you; how much less this house which I have built!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet you have respect to the prayer of your slave, and to his supplication, O Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer which your slave prays before you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that your eyes may be open toward this house day and night, even toward the place of which you have said that you would put your name there; to listen to the prayer which your slave will pray toward this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And listen to the supplications of your slave, and of your people Israel, when they will pray toward this place: yes, hear from your dwelling-place, even from heaven; and when you hear forgive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If a man sins against his fellow man, and he is subjected to an oath to cause him to swear, and he comes [and] swears before your altar in this house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>then hear from heaven, and act, and judge your slaves, requiting the wicked, to bring his way on his own head;

and send rain on your land, which you have given to your people for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>If there is in the land famine, if there is pestilence, if there is blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemies besiege them in the gates of their land; whatever plague or whatever sickness there is;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>whatever prayer and supplication is made by all of man, and by all your people Israel, who will know every man his own plague and his own sorrow, and will spread forth his hands toward this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>then hear from heaven your dwelling-place and forgive, and render to every man according to all his ways, whose heart you know; for you, even you only, know the hearts of the sons of man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that they may fear you, to walk in your ways, so long as they live in the land which you gave to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Moreover concerning the foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, when he will come from a far country for your great name's sake, and your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm; when they will come and pray toward this house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling-place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you for; that all the peoples of the earth may know your name, and fear you, as does your people Israel, and that they may know that this house which I have built is called by your name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If your people go out to battle against their enemies, by whatever way you will send them, and they pray to you toward this city which you have chosen, and the house which I have built for your name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>then hear from heaven their prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>If they sin against you (for there is no man who does not sin), and you are angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captive to a land far off or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>yet if they will bethink themselves in the land where they are carried captive, and turn again, and plead to you for mercy in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have dealt wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>if they return to you with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have carried them captive, and pray toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, and the city which you have chosen, and toward the house which I have built for your name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then hear from heaven, even from your dwelling-place, their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their cause, and forgive your people who have sinned against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now, O my God, let, I urge you, your eyes be open, and let your ears be attentive, to the prayer that is made in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now therefore arise, O Yahweh God, into your resting-place, you, and the ark of your strength: let your priests, O Yahweh God, be clothed with salvation, and let your saints rejoice in goodness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>O Yahweh God, don't turn away the face of your anointed one: remember [your] loving-kindnesses to David your slave.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
