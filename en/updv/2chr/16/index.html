Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the eyes of Yahweh run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. In this you have done foolishly; for from from now on you will have wars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison-house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And, look, the acts of Asa, first and last, see, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in the thirty and ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet; his disease was exceedingly great: yet in his disease he did not seek to Yahweh, but to the physicians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they buried him in his own tombs, which he had cut out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and diverse kinds [of spices] prepared by the perfumers' art: and they made a very great burning for him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
