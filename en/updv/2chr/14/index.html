In his days the land was quiet ten years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>for he took away the foreign altars, and the high places, and broke down the pillars, and hewed down the Asherim,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and commanded Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the sun-images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he built fortified cities in Judah; for the land was quiet, and he had no war in those years, because Yahweh had given him rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars; the land is yet before us, because we have sought Yahweh our God; we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Asa had an army that bore bucklers and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, 280,000: all these were mighty men of valor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an army of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and he came to Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Asa went out to meet him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Asa cried to Yahweh his God, and said, Yahweh, there is none besides you to help, between the mighty and him who has no strength: help us, O Yahweh our God; for we rely on you, and in your name we have come against this multitude. O Yahweh, you are our God; don't let common man prevail against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Yahweh struck the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them to Gerar: and there fell of the Ethiopians so many that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before Yahweh, and before his host; and they carried away very much booty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they struck all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of Yahweh came upon them: and they despoiled all the cities; for there was much spoil in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>They struck also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep in abundance, and camels, and returned to Jerusalem.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
