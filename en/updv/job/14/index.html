Not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with you, And you have appointed his bounds that he can't pass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Look away from him, that he may rest, Until he will accomplish, as a hired worker, his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there is hope of a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, And that its tender branch will not cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though its root waxes old in the earth, And its stock dies in the ground;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But [noble] man dies, and is laid low: Yes, man gives up the ghost, and where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>[As] the waters fail from the sea, And the river wastes and dries up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So man lies down and does not rise: Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, That you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past, That you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a [noble] man die, will he live [again]? All the days of my warfare I would wait, Until my release should come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You would call, and I would answer you: You would have a desire to the work of your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you number my steps: Don't you watch over my sin?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And you fasten up my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the mountain falling comes to nothing; And the rock is removed out of its place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The waters wear the stones; The overflowings of it wash away the dust of the earth: So you destroy the hope of common man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You prevail forever against him, and he passes; You change his countenance, and send him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; And they are brought low, but he doesn't perceive it of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his flesh on him has pain, And his soul inside him mourns.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
