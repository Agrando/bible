Who will say to him, What are you doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>God will not withdraw his anger; The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How much less shall I answer him, And choose out my words [to reason] with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whom, though I were righteous, yet I would not answer; I would plead for mercy to my judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If I had called, and he had answered me, Yet I would not believe that he listened to my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he breaks me with a tempest, And multiplies my wounds without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He will not allow me to take my breath, But fills me with bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If [we speak] of strength, look, [he is] mighty! And if of justice, Who, [he says], will summon me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Though I be righteous, my own mouth will condemn me: Though I be perfect, it will prove me perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I am perfect; I do not regard myself; I despise my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is all one; therefore I say, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If the scourge slays suddenly, He will mock at the trial of the innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covers the faces of its judges: If [it is] not [he], then who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now my days are swifter than a post: They flee away, they see no good,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They are passed away as the swift ships; As the eagle that swoops on the prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my [sad] countenance, and be of good cheer;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I will be condemned; Why then do I labor in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I wash myself with snow, And clean my my hands with lye;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Yet you will plunge me in the ditch, And my own clothes will be disgusted with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he is not a man as I am, that I should answer him, That we should come together in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If only there were an umpire between us That might lay his hand on us both,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>[Then] he would take his rod away from me, And his terror would not make me afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then I would speak and not fear him; For I am not so in myself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
