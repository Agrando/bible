And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Yahweh said to Satan, Have you considered my slave Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil: and he still holds fast his integrity, although you moved me against him, to destroy him without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Satan answered Yahweh, and said, Skin for skin, yes, all that a man has he will give for his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But put forth your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce you to your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Yahweh said to Satan, Look, he is in your hand; only spare his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh, and struck Job with intense boils from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took for himself a potsherd to scrape himself with it; and he sat among the ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your integrity? Renounce God, and die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now when Job's three companions heard of all this evil that came upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they lifted up their eyes far off, and didn't know him, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word to him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
