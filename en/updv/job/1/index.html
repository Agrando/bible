Thus Job did continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Yahweh, that Satan also came among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Yahweh said to Satan, Where do you come from? Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Yahweh said to Satan, Have you considered my slave Job? For there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one who fears God, and turns away from evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Satan answered Yahweh, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Haven't you made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance has increased in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will renounce you to your face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Yahweh said to Satan, Look, all that he has is in your power; only on him do not put forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys pasturing beside them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the Sabeans fell [on them], and took them away: yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God has fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell on the camels, and have taken them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and, look, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I only have escaped alone to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshiped;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he said, Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked I will return there: Yahweh gave, and Yahweh has taken away; blessed be the name of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job did not sin, nor charge God foolishly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
