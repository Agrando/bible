Therefore I have uttered that which I didn't understand, Things too wonderful for me, which I didn't know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Hear, I urge you, and I will speak; I will demand of you, and declare you to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear; But now my eye sees you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore I abhor [myself], And repent in dust and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was so, that, after Yahweh had spoken these words to Job, Yahweh said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against you, and against your two companions; for you{+} have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my slave Job has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my slave Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my slave Job will pray for you{+}; for him I will accept, that I do not deal with you{+} after your{+} folly; for you{+} have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my slave Job has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according to as Yahweh commanded them: and Yahweh accepted Job.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Yahweh turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his companions: and Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then there came to him all his brothers, and all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, and ate bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he called the name of the first, Jemimah: and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, [even] four generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Job died, being old and full of days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
