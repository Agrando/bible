Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? Or is it gain [to him], that you make your ways perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Is it for your fear [of him] that he reproves you, That he enters with you into judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Isn't your wickedness great? Neither is there any end to your iniquities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For you have taken pledges of your brother for nothing, And stripped the naked of their clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You haven't given water to the weary to drink, And you have withheld bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You have sent widows away empty, And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore snares are round about you, And sudden fear troubles you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Or darkness, so that you can't see, And abundance of waters cover you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Isn't God in the height of heaven? And look at the height of the stars, how high they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you say, What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he does not see; And he walks on the vault of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Will you keep the old way Which wicked men have trodden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Who were snatched away before their time, Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Who said to God, Depart from us; And, What can the Almighty do for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet he filled their houses with good things: But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The righteous see it, and are glad; And the innocent laugh them to scorn,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>[Saying], Surely those who rose up against us are cut off, And the remnant of them the fire has consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace: By this good will come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Receive, I pray you, the law from his mouth, And lay up his words in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up, If you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And lay [your] treasure in the dust, And [the gold of] Ophir among the stones of the brooks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the Almighty will be your treasure, And precious silver to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, And will lift up your face to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you; And you will pay your vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You will also decree a thing, and it will be established to you; And light will shine on your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When they are cast down, you will say, [There is] lifting up; And the humble person he will save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He will deliver [even] him who is not innocent: Yes, he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
