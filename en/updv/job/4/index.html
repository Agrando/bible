But who can withhold himself from speaking?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Look, you have instructed many, And you have strengthened the weak hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your words have upheld him who was falling, And you have made firm the feeble knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now it has come to you, and you faint; It touches you, and you are troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Isn't your fear [of God] your confidence, [And] the integrity of your ways your hope?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember, I pray you, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According to as I have seen, those who plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The old lion perishes for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, And my ear received a whisper of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falls on men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; A form was before my eyes: [There was] silence, and I heard a voice [saying],</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Will common man be more just than God? Will [noble] man be more pure than his Maker?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Look, he puts no trust in his slaves; And his angels he charges with folly:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How much more those who stay in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Between morning and evening they are destroyed: They perish forever without any regarding it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Isn't their tent-cord plucked up inside them?
