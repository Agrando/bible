And should a man full of talk be justified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Should your boastings make men hold their peace? And when you mock, will no man make you ashamed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For you say, My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But oh that God would speak, And open his lips against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And that he would show you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Can you by searching find out God? Can you find out the Almighty to perfection?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>At the height of heaven, what can you do? Deeper than Sheol; what can you know?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The measure of it is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If he passes through, and shuts up, And calls to judgment, then who can hinder him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he knows false men: He sees iniquity also, even though he does not consider it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But a vain man is void of understanding, Yes, man is born [as] a wild donkey's colt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If you set your heart aright, And stretch out your hands toward him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, And don't let unrighteousness stay in your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Surely then you will lift up your face without spot; Yes, you will be steadfast, and will not fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For you will forget your misery; You will remember it as waters that are passed away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And [your] lifetime will be clearer than the noonday; Though there is darkness, it will be as the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you will be secure, because there is hope; Yes, you will search [about you], and will take your rest in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also you will lie down, and none will make you afraid; Yes, many will make suit to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And they will have no way to flee; And their hope will be the giving up of the ghost.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
