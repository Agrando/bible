And are not his days like the days of a hired worker?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>As a slave who earnestly desires the shadow, And as a hired worker that looks for his wages:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, And are spent without hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Oh remember that my life is a breath: My eye will no more see good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The eye of him who sees me will look at me no more; Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, So he who goes down to Sheol will come up no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He will return no more to his house, Neither will his place know him anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That you set a watch over me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When I say, My bed will comfort me, My couch will ease my complaint;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then you scare me with dreams, And terrify me through visions:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So that my soul chooses strangling, And death rather than my bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I loathe [my life]; I would not live always: Let me alone; for my days are vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What is common man, that you should magnify him, And that you should set your mind on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And that you should visit him every morning, And try him every moment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>How long will you not look away from me, Nor let me alone until I swallow down my spittle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If I have sinned, what do I do to you, O you watcher of man? Why have you set me as a mark for you, So that I am a burden to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And why don't you pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust; And you will seek me diligently, but I will not be.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
