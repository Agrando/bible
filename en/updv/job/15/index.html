Or were you brought forth before the hills?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Have you heard the secret counsel of God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What do you know, that we don't know? What do you understand, which is not in us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much older than your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Are the consolations of God too small for you, Even the word that is gentle toward you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why does your heart carry you away? And why do your eyes flash,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>That against God you turn your spirit, And let words go out of your mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What is common man, that he should be clean? And he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Look, he puts no trust in his holy ones; Yes, the heavens are not clean in his eyes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>How much less one who is disgusting and corrupt, A man who drinks iniquity like water!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will show you, hear me; And that which I have seen I will declare:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>To whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The wicked man travails with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A sound of terrors is in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer will come upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He does not believe that he will return out of darkness, And he is destined for the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He is destined for bread, as bread for vultures. He knows that he is ready for destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The day of darkness terrifies him, distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Because he has stretched out his hand against God, And behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He runs on him with a [stiff] neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because he has covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat on his loins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he has stayed in desolate cities, In houses which no man inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He will not be rich, neither will his substance continue, Neither will their possessions be extended on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He will not depart out of darkness; The flame will dry up his branches, And by the breath of [God's] mouth he will go away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity will be his recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It will be accomplished before his time, And his branch will not be green.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And will cast off his flower as the olive-tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the company of the godless will be barren, And fire will consume the tents of bribery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They are pregnant with mischief, and give birth to iniquity, And their heart prepares deceit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
