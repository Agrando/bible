Or who has disposed the whole world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If he sets his heart on himself, [If] he gathers to himself his spirit and his breath;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All flesh will perish together, And man will turn again to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If now [you have] understanding, hear this: Listen to the voice of my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Will even one who hates justice govern? And will you condemn him who is righteous [and] mighty?--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[Him] who says to a king, [You are] vile, [Or] to nobles, [You{+} are] wicked;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Who does not respect the persons of princes, Nor regards the rich more than the poor; For all of them are the work of his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without a [human] hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For his eyes are on the ways of a man, And he sees all his goings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he does not need further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He breaks in pieces mighty men [in ways] past finding out, And sets others in their stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he takes knowledge of their works; And he overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He strikes them as wicked men In the open sight of others;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hides his face, who then can see him? Alike whether [it is done] to a nation, or to man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He makes king [the] godless man From among the seducers of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For has any said to God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [anymore]:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>That which I don't see teach me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Will his recompense be as you will, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Men of understanding will say to me, And the wise [noble] man will listen to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Job speaks without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Oh that Job were tried to the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he adds rebellion to his sin; He claps his hands among us, And multiplies his words against God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
