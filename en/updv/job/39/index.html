[Or] can you mark when the hinds calve?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bring forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and don't return again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who has sent out the wild donkey free? Or who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He scorns the tumult of the city, Neither does he hear the shoutings of the driver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searches after every green thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will the wild-ox be content to serve you? Or will he spend the night by your crib?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Can you bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Will you trust him, because his strength is great? Or will you leave to him your labor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed, And gather [the grain] of your threshing-floor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; [But] is it a pious plumage and down?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For she leaves her eggs on the earth, And warms them in the dust,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And forgets that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor is in vain, [she is] without fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because God has deprived her of wisdom, Neither has he imparted to her understanding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What time she lifts up herself on high, She scorns the horse and his rider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have you given the horse [his] might? Have you clothed his neck with the quivering mane?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Have you made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength: He goes out to meet the armed men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither does he turn back from the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The quiver rattles against him, The flashing spear and the javelin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He swallows the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither does he believe that it is the voice of the trumpet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As often as the trumpet [sounds] he says, Aha! And he smells the battle far off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, (And) stretches her wings toward the south?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, And makes her nest on high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>On the cliff she dwells, and makes her home, On the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From there she spies out the prey; Her eyes watch it far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there she is.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
