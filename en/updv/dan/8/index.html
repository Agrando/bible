now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and saw there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; and no beasts could stand before him, neither was there any who could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and magnified himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And as I was considering, look, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and did not touch the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing before the river, and ran on him in the fury of his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with anger against him, and struck the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled on him; and there was none who could deliver the ram out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the he-goat magnified himself exceedingly: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and instead of it there came up four notable [horns] toward the four winds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceedingly great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious [land].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the ground, and trampled on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yes, it magnified itself, even to the prince of the host; and it took away from him the continual [burnt-offering], and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the host was given over [to it] together with the continual [burnt-offering] through transgression; and it cast down truth to the ground, and it did [its pleasure] and prospered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I heard a holy one speaking; and another holy one said to that certain one who spoke, How long will be the vision [concerning] the continual [burnt-offering], and the transgression that makes desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings; then the sanctuary will be cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, that I sought to understand it; and, look, there stood before me as the appearance of a [prominent] man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I heard man's voice between [the banks of] the Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was frightened, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O Son of Man; for the vision belongs to the time of the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep with my face toward the ground; but he touched me, and set me upright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, Look, I will make you know what will be in the latter time of the indignation; for it belongs to the appointed time of the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The ram which you saw, that had the two horns, they are the kings of Media and Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The he-goat is the king of Greece: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as for that which was broken, in the place of which four stood up, four kingdoms will stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors have come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, will stand up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his power will be mighty, but not by his own power; and he will destroy wonderfully, and will prosper and do [his pleasure]; and he will destroy the mighty ones and the holy people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And through his policy he will cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he will magnify himself in his heart, and in [their] security he will destroy many: he will also stand up against the prince of princes; but he will be broken without hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the vision of the evenings and mornings which has been told is true: but you shut up the vision; for it belongs to many days [to come].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I, Daniel, fainted, and was sick certain days; then I rose up, and did the king's business: and I wondered at the vision, but none understood it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
