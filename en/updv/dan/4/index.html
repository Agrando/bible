The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, don't let the dream, or the interpretation, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to heaven, and its sight to all the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whose leaves were fair, and its fruit much, and in it was food for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt, and on whose branches the birds of the heavens stayed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>it is you, O king, that have grown and become strong; for your greatness has grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And whereas the king saw a watcher and a holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Cut down the tree, and destroy it; nevertheless leave the stump of its roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and bronze, in the tender grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven: and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, until seven times pass over him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>this is the interpretation, O king, and it is the decree of the Most High, which has come upon my lord the king:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that you will be driven from men, and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field, and you will be made to eat grass as oxen, and will be wet with the dew of heaven, and seven times will pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; your kingdom will be sure to you, after that you will have known that the heavens do rule.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if there may be a lengthening of your tranquillity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the end of twelve months he was walking in the royal palace of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The king spoke and said, Is not this great Babylon, which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, [saying], O King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken: The kingdom has departed from you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and you will be driven from men; and your dwelling will be with the beasts of the field; you will be made to eat grass as oxen; and seven times will pass over you; until you know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever he will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The same hour was the thing fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and ate grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, until his hair was grown like eagles' [feathers], and his nails like birds' [claws].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and I praised and honored him who lives forever; for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom from generation to generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can hold back his hand, or say to him, What are you doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>At the same time my understanding returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my majesty and brightness returned to me; and my counselors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of heaven; for all his works are truth, and his ways justice; and those who walk in pride he is able to abase.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
