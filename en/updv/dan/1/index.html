So you{+} would endanger my head with the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Daniel said to the steward whom the prince of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Prove your slaves, I urge you, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then let our countenances be looked on before you, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king's dainties; and as you see, deal with your slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he listened to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that ate of the king's dainties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the steward took away their dainties, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in every matter of wisdom and understanding, concerning which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the sacred scholars and psychics who were in all his realm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Daniel continued even to the first year of King Cyrus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
