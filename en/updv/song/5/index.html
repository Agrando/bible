Eat, O companions; Drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I was asleep, but my heart awoke: It is the voice of my beloved that knocks, [saying], Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; For my head is filled with dew, My locks with the drops of the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I have put off my garment; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My beloved put in his hand through the hole, And my insides were moved for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I rose up to open to my beloved; And my hands dropped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, On the handles of the bolt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I opened to my beloved; But my beloved had withdrawn himself, [and] was gone. My soul had failed me when he spoke: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The watchmen who go about the city found me, They struck me, they wounded me; The keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I adjure you{+}, O daughters of Jerusalem, If you{+} find my beloved, That you{+} tell him, that I am sick from love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What is your beloved more than [another] beloved, O you most beautiful among women? What is your beloved more than [another] beloved, That you so adjure us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>My beloved is white and ruddy, The chiefest among ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>His head is the most fine gold; His locks are bushy, [and] black as a raven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His eyes are like doves beside the water-brooks, Washed with milk, [and] fitly set.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>His cheeks are as a bed of spices, [As] banks of sweet herbs: His lips are lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His hands are rings of gold set with beryl: His insides are ivory work overlaid [with] sapphires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>His legs are pillars of marble, set on sockets of fine gold: His aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>His mouth is most sweet; Yes, he is altogether lovely.
