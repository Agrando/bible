and to your{+} sisters, Ruhamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Contend with your{+} mother, contend; for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and let her put away her prostitution from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>or else I will strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yes, on her sons I will have no mercy; for they are sons of prostitution;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>for their mother has prostituted; she who became pregnant with them has done shamefully; for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore, look, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and I will build a wall against her, that she will not find her paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she will follow after her lovers, but she will not overtake them; and she will seek them, but will not find them: then will she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then it was better with me than now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For she did not know that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied to her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I will take back my grain in its time, and my new wine in its season, and will pluck away my wool and my flax which should have covered her nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now I will uncover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and none will deliver her out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, of which she has said, These are my wages that my lovers have given me; and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field will eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will visit on her the days of the Baalim, to which she burned incense, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, look, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak comfortably to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she will answer there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it will be at that day, says Yahweh, that you will call: Ishi; and will call me no more: Baali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, and they will no more be mentioned by their name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in that day I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them to lie down safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will betroth you to me forever; yes, I will betroth you to me in righteousness, and in justice, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness; and you will know Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it will come to pass in that day, I will answer, says Yahweh, I will answer the heavens, and they will answer the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the earth will answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they will answer Jezreel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sow her to me in the earth; and I will have mercy on her who had not obtained mercy; and I will say to those who were not my people, You are my people; and they will say, [You are] my God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
