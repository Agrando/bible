For this cause the world doesn't know us, because it did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beloved, we are now children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we will be. We know that, if he will be manifested, we will be like him; for we will see him even as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And everyone who has this hope [set] on him purifies himself, even as he is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone who does sin, also does lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you{+} know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whoever stays in him doesn't sin: whoever sins has neither seen him nor known him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>[My] little children, let no man lead you{+} astray: he who does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>he who does sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whoever is begotten of God does not sin, because his seed stays in him: and he can't sin, because he is begotten of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: anyone not doing righteousness is not of God, neither is he who is not loving his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message which you{+} heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>not as Cain [who] was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And why did he slay him? Because his works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And don't marvel, brothers, if the world hates you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. He who doesn't love stays in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you{+} know that any murderer does not have eternal life staying in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hereby we know love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But whoever has the world's goods, and looks at his brother in need, and shuts up his compassion from him, how does the love of God stay in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>[My] Little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And hereby we will know that we are of the truth, and will assure our heart before him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Beloved, if our heart doesn't condemn us, we have boldness toward God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and whatever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he who keeps his commandments stays in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
