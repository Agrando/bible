And the Spirit is who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three who bear witness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three are in [agreement as] one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for the witness of God is this, that he has borne witness concerning his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who believes on the Son of God, has the witness in himself: he who doesn't believe God, has made him a liar; because he has not believed in the witness that God has borne concerning his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the witness is this, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who has the Son, has the life; he who does not have the Son of God, does not have the life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things I have written to you{+}, that you{+} may know that you{+} have eternal life, [even] to you{+} who believe on the name of the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if we know that he hears us whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any man sees his brother sinning a sin not to death, he will ask, and [God] will give him life--for those who sin not to death.
