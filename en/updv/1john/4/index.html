By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and everyone who loves is begotten of God, and knows God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who doesn't love doesn't know God; for God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this was the love of God manifested in us, that God has sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son [to be] the propitiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No man has seen God at any time: if we love one another, God stays in us, and his love is perfected in us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>hereby we know that we stay in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [to be] the Savior of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever will confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God stays in him, and he in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we know and have believed the love which God has in us.
