And if any man sins, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>He who says, I know him, and doesn't keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but whoever keeps his word, in him truly has the love of God been perfected. Hereby we know that we are in him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>he who says he stays in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Beloved, I don't write a new commandment to you{+}, but an old commandment which you{+} had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which you{+} heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, a new commandment I write to you{+}, which thing is true in him and in you{+}; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He who says he is in the light and hates his brother, is in the darkness even until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loves his brother stays in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he who hates his brother is in the darkness, and walks in the darkness, and doesn't know where he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I write to you{+}, [my] little children, because your{+} sins are forgiven you{+} for his name's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write to you{+}, fathers, because you{+} know him who is from the beginning. I write to you{+}, young men, because you{+} have overcome the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have written to you{+}, little children, because you{+} know the Father. I have written to you{+}, fathers, because you{+} know him who is from the beginning. I have written to you{+}, young men, because you{+} are strong, and the word of God stays in you{+}, and you{+} have overcome the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Don't love the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For all that is in the world, the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the vain glory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the world passes away, and its desire: but he who does the will of God stays forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, it is the last hour: and as you{+} heard that antichrist comes, even now have there arisen many antichrists; therefore we know that it is the last hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have stayed with us: but [they went out], that they might be made manifest that all of them are not of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you{+} have an anointing from the Holy One, and all of you{+} know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not written to you{+} because you{+} don't know the truth, but because you{+} do know it, and because no lie is of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is the liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, [even] he who denies the Father and the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whoever denies the Son, the same doesn't have the Father: he who confesses the Son has the Father also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>As for you{+}, let that stay in you{+} which you{+} heard from the beginning. If that which you{+} heard from the beginning stays in you{+}, you{+} also will stay in the Son, and in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this is the promise which he promised us, [even] the eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>These things I have written to you{+} concerning those who would lead you{+} astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as for you{+}, the anointing which you{+} received of him stays in you{+}, and you{+} don't need that anyone teach you{+}; but as his anointing teaches you{+} concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you{+}, you{+} stay in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, [my] little children, stay in him; that, when he is manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you{+} know that he is righteous, you{+} know that everyone also that does righteousness is begotten of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
