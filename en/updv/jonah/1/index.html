But Jonah had gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, What do you mean, O sleeper? Arise, call on your God, perhaps God will think on us, that we will not perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said every one to his fellow man, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is on us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then they said to him, Tell us, we pray you, for whose cause this evil is on us; what is your occupation? And where do you come from? What is your country? And of what people are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear Yahweh, the God of heaven, who has made the sea and the dry land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then the men were exceedingly afraid, and said to him, What is this that you have done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Yahweh, because he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they said to him, What shall we do to you, that the sea may be calm to us? For the sea grew more and more tempestuous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so the sea will be calm to you{+}: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is on you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore they cried to Yahweh, and said, We urge you, O Yahweh, we urge you, let us not perish for this man's life, and don't lay innocent blood on us; for you, O Yahweh, have done as it pleased you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the men feared Yahweh exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice to Yahweh, and made vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Yahweh prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the insides of the fish three days and three nights.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
