but on the Sabbath day it will be opened, and on the day of the new moon it will be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the prince will enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside, and will stand by the post of the gate; and the priests will prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, and he will worship at the threshold of the gate: then he will go forth; but the gate will not be shut until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the people of the land will worship at the door of that gate before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the burnt-offering that the prince will offer to Yahweh will be on the Sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the meal-offering will be an ephah for the ram, and the meal-offering for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And on the day of the new moon it will be a young bull without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they will be without blemish:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he will prepare a meal-offering, an ephah for the bull, and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according to as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when the prince will enter, he will go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he will go forth by the way of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when the people of the land will come before Yahweh in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north gate to worship will go forth by the way of the south gate; and he who enters by the way of the south gate will go forth by the way of the north gate: he will not return by the way of the gate by which he came in, but will go forth straight before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the prince, when they go in, will go in in the midst of them; and when they go forth, they will go forth [together].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meal-offering will be an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil to an ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when the prince will prepare a freewill-offering, a burnt-offering or peace-offerings as a freewill-offering to Yahweh, one will open for him the gate that looks toward the east; and he will prepare his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he does on the Sabbath day: then he will go forth; and after his going forth one will shut the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you will prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt-offering to Yahweh daily: morning by morning you will prepare it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you will prepare a meal-offering with it morning by morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil, to moisten the fine flour; a meal-offering to Yahweh continually by perpetual ordinances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus they will prepare the lamb, and the meal-offering, and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: If the prince gives a gift to any of his sons, it is his inheritance, it will belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if he gives of his inheritance a gift to one of his slaves, it will be his to the year of liberty; then it will return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it will be for his sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover the prince will not take of the people's inheritance, to thrust them out of their possession; he will give inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my people are not scattered every man from his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests, which looked toward the north: and, see, there was a place on the hinder part westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to me, This is the place where the priests will boil the trespass-offering and the sin-offering, [and] where they will bake the meal-offering; that they do not bring them forth into the outer court, to sanctify the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, look, in every corner of the court there was a court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed, forty [cubits] long and thirty broad: these four set into the corners were of one measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And there was a wall round about in them, round about the four, and boiling-places were made under the walls round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then he said to me, These are the boiling-houses, where the ministers of the house will boil the sacrifice of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
