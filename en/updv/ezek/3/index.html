Then I ate it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he said to me, Son of Man, go, get to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words you can't understand. Surely, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Look, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As an adamant harder than flint I have made your forehead: don't fear them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover he said to me, Son of Man, all my words that I will speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And go, get to them of the captivity, to the sons of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of Yahweh from his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Yahweh was strong on me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and there where they were dwelling; and I sat there dismayed among them seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of Man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I say to the wicked, You will surely die; and you do not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man will die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he will die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he will die: because you have not given him warning, he will die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done will not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous not sin, and he does not sin, he will surely live, because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the hand of Yahweh was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, look, the glory of Yahweh stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet; and he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself inside your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But you, Son of Man, look, they will lay bands on you, and will bind you with them, and you will not go out among them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, that you will be mute, and will not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
