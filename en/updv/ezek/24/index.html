Take out of it piece after piece; No lot has fallen on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it on the bare rock; she did not pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood on the bare rock, that it should not be covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then set it empty on its coals, that it may be hot, and its bronze may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>It has frustrated the efforts [to clean it]; yet her great rust does not go forth out of her; her rust [does not go forth] by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed you and you were not cleansed, you will not be cleansed from your filthiness anymore, until I have caused my wrath toward you to rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I, Yahweh, have spoken it: it will come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, they will judge you, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Son of Man, look, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet you will neither mourn nor weep, neither will your tears run down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind your headtire on you, and put your sandals on your feet, and don't cover your lips, and don't eat the bread of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So I spoke to the people in the morning; and at evening my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then I said to them, The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your{+} power, the desire of your{+} eyes, and that which your{+} soul pities; and your{+} sons and your{+} daughters whom you{+} have left behind will fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you{+} will do as I have done: you{+} will not cover your{+} lips, nor eat the bread of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And your{+} tires will be on your{+} heads, and your{+} sandals on your{+} feet: you{+} will not mourn nor weep; but you{+} will pine away in your{+} iniquities, and moan one toward another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus Ezekiel will be to you{+} a sign; according to all that he has done you{+} will do: when this comes, then you{+} will know that I am the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you, Son of Man, will it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that on which they set their heart, their sons and their daughters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that in that day he who escapes will come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped, and you will speak, and be mute no more: so you will be a sign to them; and they will know that I am Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
