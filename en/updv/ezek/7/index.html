and I will bring on you all your disgusting behaviors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And my eye will not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your disgusting behaviors will be in the midst of you: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: An evil, an only evil; look, it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An end has come, the end has come; it awakes against you; look, it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Your doom has come to you, O inhabitant of the land: the time has come, the day is near, [a day of] tumult, and not [of] joyful shouting, on the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now I will shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your disgusting behaviors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And my eye will not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring on you according to your ways; and your disgusting behaviors will be in the midst of you; and you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, do strike.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Look, the day, see it comes: your doom has gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them [will remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither will there be eminency among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The time has come, the day draws near: don't let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all their multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller will not return to that which is sold, although they are yet alive: for the vision is concerning their whole multitude, none will return; neither will any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all their multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine inside: he who is in the field will die with the sword: and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence will devour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the ones of those who escape will escape, and will be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, everyone in his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>All hands will be feeble, and all knees will be weak as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They will also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror will cover them; and shame will be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They will cast their silver in the streets, and their gold will be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Yahweh: they will not satisfy their souls, neither fill their insides; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their disgusting things [and] their detestable things in it: therefore I have made it to them as an unclean thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they will profane it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will also turn my face from them, and they will profane my secret [place]; and robbers will enter into it, and profane it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they will possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places will be profaned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Destruction comes; and they will seek peace, and there will be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Mischief will come upon mischief, and rumor will be on rumor; and they will seek a vision of the prophet; but the law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king will mourn, and the prince will be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land will be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts I will judge them; and they will know that I am Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
