Were your prostitutions a small matter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that you have slain my sons, and delivered them up, in causing them to pass through [the fire] to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in all your disgusting behaviors and your prostitutions you haven't remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, and were weltering in your blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it has come to pass after all your wickedness, (woe, woe to you! says the Sovereign Yahweh,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>that you have built yourself a vaulted place, and have made yourself a lofty place in every street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You have built your lofty place at the head of every way, and were disgusted with your beauty, and have spread your legs for everyone who passed by, and multiplied your prostitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You have also prostituted with the Egyptians, your neighbors, great of flesh; and have multiplied your prostitution, to provoke me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Look therefore, I have stretched out my hand over you, and have diminished your ordinary [food], and delivered you to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of your lewd way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have prostituted also with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; yes, you have prostituted with them, and yet you were not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>You have moreover multiplied your prostitution to the land of traffic, to Chaldea; and yet you were not satisfied herewith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How weak is your heart, says the Sovereign Yahweh, seeing you do all these things, the work of an overbearing prostitute;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>in that you build your vaulted place at the head of every way, and make your lofty place in every street, and have not been as a prostitute, in that you scorn wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>A wife who commits adultery! Who takes strangers instead of her husband!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They give gifts to all prostitutes; but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And you are different from [other] women in your prostitution, in that no one solicits you for prostitution; and you pay but you are not paid, therefore you are different.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore, O prostitute, hear the word of Yahweh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness uncovered through your prostitution with your lovers; and because of all the idols of your disgusting things, and for the blood of your sons, that you gave to them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>therefore look, I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all those who you have loved, with all those who you have hated; I will even gather them against you on every side, and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will judge you, as women who break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will bring on you the blood of wrath and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I will also give you into their hand, and they will throw down your vaulted place, and break down your lofty places; and they will strip you of your clothes, and take your fair jewels; and they will leave you naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They will also bring up a company against you, and they will stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they will burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will cause you to cease prostituting, and you will also give no hire anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So I will cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy will depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be angry no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because you haven't remembered the days of your youth, but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, look, I also will bring your way on your head, says the Sovereign Yahweh: and you will not commit this lewdness with all your disgusting behaviors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Look, everyone who uses proverbs will use [this] proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You are the daughter of your mother, that loathes her husband and her sons; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and their sons: your{+} mother was a Hittite, and your{+} father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And your elder sister is Samaria, that dwells at your left hand, she and her daughters; and your younger sister, that dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet you have not walked in their ways, nor followed their disgusting behaviors; but, as [if that were] a very little [thing], you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, Sodom your sister did not do, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And then they were lifted up, and then did disgusting things before me: therefore I took them away as I saw [this].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Neither did Samaria commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your disgusting behaviors more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the disgusting things that you have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>You also, bear you your own shame, in that you have given judgment for your sisters; through your sins you are more disgusting than they, they are more righteous than you: yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, and the captivity of your captives in the midst of them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, will return to their former estate; and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former estate; and you and your daughters will return to your{+} former estate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are round about her, the daughters of the Philistines, that do despite to you round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>You have borne your lewdness and your disgusting behaviors, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will also deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then you will remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you will receive your sisters, your elder [sisters] and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And I will establish my covenant with you; and you will know that I am Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your mouth anymore, because of your shame, when I have forgiven you all that you have done, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
