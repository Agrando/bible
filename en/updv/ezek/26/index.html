she has turned to me; I will be replenished, now that she is laid waste:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh, Look, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they will destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her a bare rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>She will be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I have spoken it, says the Sovereign Yahweh; and she will become a spoil to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her daughters who are in the field will be slain with the sword: and they will know that I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will bring on Tyre Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company, and many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He will slay with the sword your daughters in the field; and he will make forts against you, and cast up a mound against you, and raise up the buckler against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he will set his battering engines against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust will cover you: your walls will shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wagons, and of the chariots, when he will enter into your gates, as men enter into a city in which a breach is made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>With the hoofs of his horses he will tread down all your streets; he will slay your people with the sword; and the pillars of your strength will go down to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they will make a spoil of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise; and they will break down your walls, and destroy your pleasant houses; and they will lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the midst of the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps will be heard no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make you a bare rock; you will be a place for the spreading of nets; you will be built no more: for I Yahweh have spoken it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to Tyre: will not the isles shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded groan, when the slaughter is made in the midst of you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then all the princes of the sea will come down from their thrones, and lay aside their robes, and strip off their embroidered garments: they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, and will tremble every moment, and be astonished at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they will take up a lamentation over you, and say to you, How you are destroyed, that were inhabited by seafaring men, the renowned city, that was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, that caused their terror to be on all who dwelt there!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now will the isles tremble in the day of your fall; yes, the isles that are in the sea will be dismayed at your departure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: When I will make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I will bring up the deep on you, and the great waters will cover you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>then I will bring you down with those who descend into the pit, to the people of old time; and will make you to dwell in the nether parts of the earth, like places that are desolate of old, with those who go down to the pit, that you are not inhabited; but I will make glory in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will make you a terror, and you will no more have any being; though you are sought for, yet you will never be found again, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
