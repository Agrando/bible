Will he not pull up its roots, and cut off its fruit, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither? And not by a strong arm or many people can it be raised from its roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yes, look, being planted, will it prosper? Will it not completely wither, when the east wind touches it? It will wither on the rows where it grew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Say now to the rebellious house, Don't you{+} know what these things mean? Tell them, Look, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took its king, and its princes, and brought them to himself to Babylon:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and he took of the royal seed, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping his covenant it might stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he escape that does such things? Will he break the covenant, and yet escape?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As I live, says the Sovereign Yahweh, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon he will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Neither will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company help him in the war, when they cast up mounds and build forts, to cut off many persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For he has despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and look, he had given his hand, and yet has done all these things; he will not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised, and my covenant that he has broken, I will even bring it on his own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will spread my net on him, and he will be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass that he has trespassed against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all his places of refuge with all his bands will fall by the sword, and those who remain will be scattered toward every wind: and you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it on a high and lofty mountain:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>in the mountain of the height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it will stay all birds of every wing; in the shade of its branches they will stay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the trees of the field will know that I, Yahweh, have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish; I, Yahweh, have spoken and have done it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
