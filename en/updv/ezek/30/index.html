it will be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And a sword will come upon Egypt, and anguish will be in Ethiopia, when the slain will fall in Egypt; and they will take away her multitude, and her foundations will be broken down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the sons of the land that is in league, will fall with them by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Thus says Yahweh: They also that uphold Egypt will fall; and the pride of her power will come down: from the tower of Seveneh they will fall in it by the sword, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they will be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities will be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In that day messengers will go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there will be anguish on them, as in the day of Egypt; for, look, it comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, will be brought in to destroy the land; and they will draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers: I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there will be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments on No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will pour my wrath on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin will be in great anguish, and No will be broken up; and Memphis [will have] anguish daily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The young men of On and of Pibeseth will fall by the sword; and these [cities] will go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At Tehaphnehes also the day will withdraw itself, when I will break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power will cease in her: as for her, a cloud will cover her, and her daughters will go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt; and they will know that I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first [month], in the seventh [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Son of Man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, look, it has not been bound up, to apply [healing] medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it is strong to hold the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong [arm], and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he will groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh will fall down; and they will know that I am Yahweh, when I will put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will stretch it out on the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they will know that I am Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
