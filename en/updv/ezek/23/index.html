And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Oholah prostituted when she was mine; and she lusted after her lovers, on the nearby Assyrians,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she bestowed her prostitution on them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and on whomever she lusted after, with all their idols she defiled herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Neither has she left her prostitution since [the days of] Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they caressed her virgin nipples; and they poured out their prostitution on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she lusted after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters; and they slew her with the sword: and she became a byword among women; for they executed judgments on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet was she more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her prostitutions which were more than the prostitutions of her sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She lusted after the nearby Assyrians, governors and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I saw that she was defiled; they both took one way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she increased her prostitution; for she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them princes to look at, after the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as soon as she saw them she lusted after them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So she uncovered her prostitution, and uncovered her nakedness: then my soul was alienated from her, like my soul was alienated from her sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet she multiplied her prostitution, remembering the days of her youth, in which she had prostituted in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she lusted after their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, when from Egypt they caressed your nipples and squeezed your youthful breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, [and] all the Assyrians with them; desirable young men, governors and rulers all of them, princes and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they will come against you equipped with chariots, and wagons, and with a company of peoples; they will set themselves against you with buckler and shield and helmet round about; and I will commit the judgment to them, and they will judge you according to their judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will set my jealousy against you, and they will deal with you in fury; they will take away your nose and your ears; and your residue will fall by the sword: they will take your sons and your daughters; and your residue will be devoured by the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They will also strip you of your clothes, and take away your fair jewels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thus I will make your lewdness to cease from you, and your prostitution [brought] from the land of Egypt; so that you will not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your soul is alienated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and they will deal with you in hatred, and will take away all your labor, and will leave you naked and bare; and the nakedness of your prostitution will be uncovered, both your lewdness and your prostitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>These things will be done to you, for that you have prostituted after the nations, and because you are polluted with their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will give her cup into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: You will drink of your sister's cup, which is deep and large; you will be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You will even drink it and drain it out, and you will gnaw its sherds, and will tear your breasts; for I have spoken it, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your prostitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Yahweh said moreover to me: Son of Man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their disgusting behaviors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their idols they have committed adultery; and they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through [the fire] to them for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, look, thus they have done in the midst of my house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And furthermore you{+} have sent for men who come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent, and, see, they came; for whom you washed yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and sat on a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, on which you set my incense and my oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and men of the multitude of man were brought from the wilderness; and they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then I said of her who was old in adulteries, Now they will still prostitute with her, and she [with them].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they went in to her, as they go in to a prostitute: so went they in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And righteous men, they will judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And the company will stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your{+} lewdness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they will recompense your{+} lewdness on you{+}, and you{+} will bear the sins of your{+} idols; and you{+} will know that I am the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
