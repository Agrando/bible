He will not live: he has done all these disgusting things; he will surely die; his blood will be on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now, look, if he begets a son, that sees all his father's sins, which he has done, and he sees, and does not do such;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, has not defiled his fellow man's wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>neither has wronged any, has not taken anything to pledge, neither has taken by robbery, but has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that has withdrawn his hand from the poor, that has not received interest nor increase, has executed my ordinances, has walked in my statutes; he will not die for the iniquity of his father, he will surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, robbed his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, look, he will die in his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet you{+} say, Why doesn't the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he will surely live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The soul who sins will die: the son will not bear the iniquity of the father, neither will the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous will be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked will be on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all my statutes, and does that which is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>None of his transgressions that he has committed will be remembered against him: in his righteousness that he has done he will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked? says the Sovereign Yahweh; and not rather that he should return from his way, and live?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the righteous turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and does according to all the disgusting things that the wicked man does, will he live? None of his righteous deeds that he has done will be remembered: in his trespass that he has trespassed, and in his sin that he has sinned, in them he will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yet you{+} say, The way of the Lord is not fair. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is not my way fair? Are not your{+} ways unfair?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the righteous man turns away from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and dies in it; in his iniquity that he has done he will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again, when the wicked man turns away from his wickedness that he has committed, and does that which is lawful and right, he will save his soul alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because he considers, and turns away from all his transgressions that he has committed, he will surely live, he will not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet says the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not fair. O house of Israel, are not my ways fair? Are not your{+} ways unfair?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore I will judge you{+}, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Sovereign Yahweh. Return{+}, and turn yourselves from all your{+} transgressions; so iniquity will not be your{+} ruin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Cast away all your{+} transgressions from you{+}, by which you{+} have transgressed through them; and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you{+} die, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I have no pleasure in the death of him who dies, says the Sovereign Yahweh: So turn yourselves, and live.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
