And, The ancient high places are ours in possession;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because, even because they have made you{+} desolate, and swallowed you{+} up on every side, that you{+} might be a possession to the residue of the nations, and you{+} are taken up in the lips of talkers, and the evil report of the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>therefore, you{+} mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Yahweh: Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which have become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations that are round about;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the residue of the nations, and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul, in order that its pasture ground [may be delivered] for plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you{+} have borne the shame of the nations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>therefore thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I have sworn, [saying], Surely the nations that are round about you{+}, they will bear their shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you{+}, O mountains of Israel, you{+} will shoot forth your{+} branches, and yield your{+} fruit to my people Israel; for they are at hand to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, look, I am for you{+}, and I will turn to you{+}, and you{+} will be tilled and sown;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and I will multiply man on you{+}, all the house of Israel, even all of it; and the cities will be inhabited, and the waste places will be built;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and I will multiply on you{+} man and beast; and they will increase and be fruitful; and I will cause you{+} to be inhabited after your{+} former estate, and will do better [to you{+}] than at your{+} beginnings: and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yes, I will cause man to walk on you{+}, even my people Israel; and they will possess you, and you will be their inheritance, and you will no more from now on bereave them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Because they say to you{+}, You [land] are a devourer of man, and have been a bereaver of your nation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore you will devour man no more, neither bereave your nation anymore, says the Sovereign Yahweh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>neither will I let you hear anymore the shame of the nations, neither will you bear the reproach of the peoples anymore, neither will you cause your nation to stumble anymore, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of Man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their way and by their doings: their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman in her impurity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled it with their idols;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries: according to their way and according to their doings I judged them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the people came to the nations, where they went, they profaned my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people of Yahweh, and have gone forth out of his land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, where they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: I don't do [this] for your{+} sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name, which you{+} have profaned among the nations, where you{+} went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you{+} have profaned in the midst of them; and the nations will know that I am Yahweh, says the Sovereign Yahweh, when I will be sanctified in you{+} before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I will take you{+} from among the nations, and gather you{+} out of all the countries, and will bring you{+} into your{+} own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I will sprinkle clean water on you{+}, and you{+} will be clean: from all your{+} filthiness, and from all your{+} idols, I will cleanse you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>A new heart also I will give you{+}, and a new spirit I will put inside you{+}; and I will take away the stony heart out of your{+} flesh, and I will give you{+} a heart of flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will put my Spirit inside you{+}, and cause you{+} to walk in my statutes, and you{+} will keep my ordinances, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And you{+} will dwell in the land that I gave to your{+} fathers; and you{+} will be my people, and I will be your{+} God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I will save you{+} from all your{+} uncleannesses: and I will call for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that you{+} may receive no more the reproach of famine among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then you{+} will remember your{+} evil ways, and your{+} doings that were not good; and you{+} will loathe yourselves in your{+} own sight for your{+} iniquities and for your{+} disgusting behaviors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I don't do [this] for your{+} sake, says the Sovereign Yahweh, be it known to you{+}: be ashamed and confounded for your{+} ways, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: In the day that I cleanse you{+} from all your{+} iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places will be built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the land that was desolate will be tilled, whereas it was a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they will say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are fortified and inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the nations that are left round about you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places, and planted that which was desolate: I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: For this, moreover, I will be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them: I will increase them with man like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her appointed feasts, so will the waste cities be filled with flocks of man; and they will know that I am Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
