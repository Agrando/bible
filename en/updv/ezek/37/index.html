And I answered, O Sovereign Yahweh, you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, O you{+} dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh to these bones: Look, I will cause breath to enter into you{+}, and you{+} will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will lay sinews on you{+}, and will bring up flesh on you{+}, and cover you{+} with skin, and put breath in you{+}, and you{+} will live; and you{+} will know that I am Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and, look, an earthquake; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I looked, and saw that there were sinews on them, and flesh came up, and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he said to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, Son of Man, and say to the wind, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet, an exceedingly great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then he said to me, Son of Man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: look, they say, Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy, and say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will open your{+} graves, and cause you{+} to come up out of your{+} graves, O my people; and I will bring you{+} into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you{+} will know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your{+} graves, and caused you{+} to come up out of your{+} graves, O my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will put my Spirit in you{+}, and you{+} will live, and I will place you{+} in your{+} own land: and you{+} will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken it and performed it, says Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you, Son of Man, take for yourself one stick, and write on it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel his partners: then take another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and [for] all the house of Israel his partners:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they may become one in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the sons of your people will speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his partners; and I will put them with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: Look, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations, where they have gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them into their own land:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king to them all; and no more will they be two nations, neither will they be divided into two kingdoms anymore at all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>neither will they defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their backslidings, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them: so they will be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And my slave David will be king over them; and all of them will have one shepherd: they will also walk in my ordinances, and observe my statutes, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they will dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my slave, in which your{+} fathers dwelt; and they will dwell in it, they, and their sons, and the sons of their sons, forever: and David my slave will be their prince forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My tabernacle also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary will be in the midst of them forevermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
