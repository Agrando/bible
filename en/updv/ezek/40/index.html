and, look, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of bronze, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the man said to me, Son of Man, look with your eyes, and hear with your ears, and set your heart on all that I will show you; for, to the intent that I may show them to you, you were brought here: declare all that you see to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And, look, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he came to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up its steps: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He measured also the porch of the gate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; the three of them were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he measured the width of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and a border before the lodges, one cubit [on this side], and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a width of five and twenty cubits; door against door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He also made posts, threescore cubits; and the court [went] all round the gate [reaching] to the posts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And [from] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts inside the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and on [each] post were palm-trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then brought he me into the outer court; and, look, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were on the pavement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he measured the length from the forefront of the lower gate to the forefront of the inner court outside, a hundred cubits, [both] on the east and on the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured its length and its width.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And its lodges were three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arch was after the measure of the first gate: its length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And its windows, and its arch, and its palm-trees, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east;

and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he led me toward the south; and, look, a gate toward the south: and he measured its posts and its arch according to these measures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there were windows in it and in its arch round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there were seven steps to go up to it, and its arch was before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, on its posts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and its lodges, and its posts, and its arch, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in its arch round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And its post was toward the outer court; and palm-trees were on its posts: and the ascent to it had eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and its lodges, and its posts, and its arch, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in its arch round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And its post was toward the outer court; and palm-trees were on its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured [it] according to these measures;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>its lodges, its posts, and its arch: and there were windows in it round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the width five and twenty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And its post was toward the outer court; and palm-trees were on its posts, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a chamber with its door was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay on them the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And on the [one] side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, on which they slew [the sacrifices].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of cut stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; on which they laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened inside round about: and the flesh of the oblation [was brought] to the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And outside the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate, and their prospects were toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Yahweh to minister to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the width of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the width eleven cubits; and on ten steps they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
