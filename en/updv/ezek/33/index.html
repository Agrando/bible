O house of Israel, I will judge you{+} every one after his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, that one who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is struck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the hand of Yahweh had been on me in the evening, before he who had escaped came; and he had opened my mouth, until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened, and I was mute no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Son of Man, those who inhabit those waste places in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land: but we are many; the land was given to us for inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: You{+} eat with the blood, and lift up your{+} eyes to your{+} idols, and shed blood: and will you{+} possess the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You{+} stand on your{+} sword, you{+} do disgusting things, and you{+} defile every one his fellow man's wife: and will you{+} possess the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thus you will say to them, Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: As I live, surely those who are in the waste places will fall by the sword; and him who is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds and in the caves will die of the pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment; and the pride of her power will cease; and the mountains of Israel will be desolate, so that none will pass through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I have made the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all the disgusting things that they have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as for you, Son of Man, the sons of your people talk of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another, every one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you{+}, and hear what the word is that comes forth from Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they come to you like the coming of a people, and they sit before you as my people, and they hear your words, but don't do them; for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart goes after their gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And, look, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has a beautiful voice, and can play well on an instrument; for they hear your words, but they don't do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when this comes to pass, (look, it comes,) then they will know that a prophet has been among them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
