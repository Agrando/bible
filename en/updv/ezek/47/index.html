Again he measured a thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters], waters that were to the loins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Afterward he measured a thousand; [and it was] a river that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, Son of Man, have you seen [this]? Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now when I had returned, look, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to me, These waters issue forth toward the eastern region, and will go down into the Arabah; and they will go toward the sea; into the sea [will the waters go] which were made to issue forth; and the waters will be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it will come to pass, that every living creature which swarms, in every place where the rivers come, will live; and there will be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters have come there, and [the waters of the sea] will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And it will come to pass, that fishers will stand by it: from En-gedi even to En-eglaim will be a place for the spreading of nets; their fish will be after their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceedingly many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But its miry places, and its marshes, will not be healed; they will be given up to salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And by the river on its bank, on this side and on that side, will grow every tree for food, whose leaf will not wither, neither will its fruit fail: it will bring forth new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says the Sovereign Yahweh: This will be the border, by which you{+} will divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph [will have two] portions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you{+} will inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore to give it to your{+} fathers: and this land will fall to you{+} for inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this will be the border of the land: On the north side, from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer-hatticon, which is by the border of Hauran.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the border from the sea, will be Hazar-enon at the border of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead, and the land of Israel, will be the Jordan from the border to the east sea as far as Tamar. This is the east side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the south side southward will be from Tamar as far as the waters of Meriboth-kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea. This is the south side southward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the west side will be the great sea, from the border as far as opposite the entrance of Hamath. This is the west side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So you{+} will divide this land to you{+} according to the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it will come to pass, that you{+} will divide it by lot for an inheritance to you{+} and to the strangers who sojourn among you{+}, who will beget sons among you{+}; and they will be to you{+} as the home-born among the sons of Israel; they will have inheritance with you{+} among the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it will come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger sojourns, there you{+} will give him his inheritance, says the Sovereign Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
