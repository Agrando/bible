So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and look, northward of the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, Son of Man, do you see what they do? Even the great disgusting things that the house of Israel commit here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? But you will again see yet other great disgusting things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he brought me to the door of the court; and I looked and saw a hole in the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to me, Son of Man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dug in the wall, look, a door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, Go in, and see the wicked disgusting things that they do here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I went in and saw; and look, every form of creeping things, and detestable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed on the wall round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel; and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, every man with his censer in his hand; and the odor of the cloud of incense went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then he said to me, Son of Man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in his chambers of imagery? For they say, Yahweh does not see us; Yahweh has forsaken the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He also said to me, You will again see yet other great disgusting things which they do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he brought me to the door of the gate of Yahweh's house which was toward the north; and look, there sat the women weeping for Tammuz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], O Son of Man? You will again see yet greater disgusting things than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he brought me into the inner court of Yahweh's house; and look, at the door of the temple of Yahweh, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of Yahweh, and their faces toward the east; and they were worshiping the sun toward the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he said to me, Have you seen [this], O Son of Man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they do the disgusting things which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence, and have turned again to provoke me to anger: and, look, they put the branch to their nose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore I will also deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, neither will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet I will not hear them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
