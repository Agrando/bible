So David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David's slaves came into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, Do you think that David honors your father, in that he has sent comforters to you? Haven't his slaves come to you to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Hanun took David's slaves, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then there went certain persons, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them; for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your{+} beards are grown, and then return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire themselves chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Arammaacah, and out of Zobah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So they hired themselves thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and encamped before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the sons of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array at the gate of the city: and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the rest of the people he committed into the hand of Abishai his brother; and they put themselves in array against the sons of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you will help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be strong and we will be strengthened for our people, and for the cities of our God: and Yahweh will do that which is good in his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians to the battle; and they fled before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the River, with Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer at their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel together, and passed over the Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians [the men of] seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the slaves of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and served him: neither would the Syrians help the sons of Ammon anymore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
