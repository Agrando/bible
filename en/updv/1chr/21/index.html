Why does my lord require this thing? Why will he be a cause of guilt to Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people to David. And all those of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men who drew sword: and Judah was 470,000 men who drew sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Levi and Benjamin he did not count among them; for the king's word was disgusting to Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he struck Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said to God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I urge you, the iniquity of your slave; for I have done very foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Yahweh spoke to Gad, David's seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Yahweh, I offer you three things: choose for yourself one of them, that I may do it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Gad came to David, and said to him, Thus says Yahweh, Take which you will:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before your foes, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you; or three days the sword of Yahweh, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Yahweh destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I will return to him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Yahweh; for very great are his mercies: and don't let me fall into the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Yahweh sent a pestilence on Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Yahweh looked, and he repented of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now let down your hand. And the angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David said to God, Is it not I who commanded the people to be numbered? It is I who have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let your hand, I pray you, O Yahweh my God, be against me, and against my father's house; but not against your people, that they should be plagued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the angel of Yahweh commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar to Yahweh in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons who were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build on it an altar to Yahweh: for the full price you will give it to me, that the plague may be stopped from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Ornan said to David, Take it for yourself, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: look, I give [you] the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And King David said to Ornan, No; but I will truly buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is yours for Yahweh, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And David built there an altar to Yahweh, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called on Yahweh; and he answered him from heaven by fire on the altar of burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Yahweh commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into its sheath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At that time, when David saw that Yahweh had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the tabernacle of Yahweh, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
