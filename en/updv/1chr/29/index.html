Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the princes of the fathers' [houses], and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king's work, offered willingly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and they gave for the service of the house of God: of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of bronze eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they with whom [precious] stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be you, O Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yours, O Yahweh, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth [is yours]; yours is the kingdom, O Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Both riches and honor come of you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort?

And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be leader, and Zadok to be priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of King David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years he reigned in Hebron, and thirty and three [years] he reigned in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, look, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
