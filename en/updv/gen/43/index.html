Have you{+} [another] brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your{+} brother down?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will be surety for him; of my hand you will require him: if I don't bring him to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame forever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for except we had lingered, surely we would have now returned a second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And their father Israel said to them, If it is so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your{+} vessels, and carry down to the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and take double money in your{+} hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your{+} sacks carry again in your{+} hand; perhaps it was an oversight:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>take also your{+} brother, and arise, go again to the man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and God Almighty give you{+} mercy before the man, that he may release to you{+} your{+} other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men will dine with me at noon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time, we are brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall on us, and take us for slaves, and our donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spoke to him at the door of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, look, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And other money we have brought down in our hand to buy food: we don't know who put our money in our sacks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, Peace be to you{+}, don't be afraid: your{+} God, and the God of your{+} father, has given you{+} treasure in your{+} sacks: I had your{+} money. And he brought Simeon out to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their donkeys fodder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your{+} father well, the old man of whom you{+} spoke? Is he yet alive?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said, Your slave our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your{+} youngest brother, of whom you{+} spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Joseph hurried; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is disgusting to the Egyptians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one with another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he took [and sent] messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
