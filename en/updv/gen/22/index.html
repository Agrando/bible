And he said, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he said, Take now your son, your only son, whom you love, even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he split the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went to the place of which God had told him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place far off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Abraham said to his young men, You{+} remain here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here I am, my son. And he said, Look, the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son. So they went both of them together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the angel of Yahweh called to him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Don't lay your hand on the lad, neither do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, seeing you haven't withheld your son, your only son, from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and noticed a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh-jireh. As it is said to this day, On the mount of Yahweh it will be provided.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out of heaven,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and said, By myself I have sworn, says Yahweh, because you have done this thing, and haven't withheld your son, your only son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that in blessing I will bless you, and in multiplying I will multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is on the seashore. And your seed will possess the gate of his enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And in your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because you have obeyed my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Look, Milcah, she also has borne sons to your brother Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Bethuel begot Rebekah. These eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bore Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
