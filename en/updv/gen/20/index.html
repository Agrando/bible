And he sojourned in Gerar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She's my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Look, you are but a dead man, because of the woman whom you have taken. For she is a man's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now Abimelech had not had any sex with her. And he said, Lord, will you slay even a righteous nation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Didn't he say to me, She's my sister? And she, even she herself said, He's my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands I have done this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And God said to him in the dream, Yes, I know that in the integrity of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you from sinning against me. Therefore I didn't allow you to have any sex with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. And if you don't restore her, know that you will surely die, you, and all who are yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his slaves, and told all these things in their ears. And the men were very afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What have you done to us? And in what have I sinned against you, that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Abimelech said to Abraham, What did you see, that you have done this thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place. And they will slay me for my wife's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said to her, This is your kindness which you will show to me. At every place where we will come, say of me, He is my brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and male slaves and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah his wife to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Abimelech said, Look, my land is before you. Dwell where it pleases you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to Sarah he said, See, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver. Look, it is for you a covering of the eyes to all who are with you. And in respect of all you are righted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Abraham prayed to God. And God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his female slaves. And they gave birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Yahweh had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
