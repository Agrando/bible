And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two female slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he put the female slaves and their children first, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with you? And he said, The children whom God has graciously given your slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then the female slaves came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and afterward came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said, What do you mean by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which you have be yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob said, No, I pray you, if now I have found favor in your sight, then receive my present at my hand; since I have seen your face, as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Take, I pray you, my gift that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his slave: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come to my lord, to Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Esau said, Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are with me. And he said, Why do that? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built himself a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
