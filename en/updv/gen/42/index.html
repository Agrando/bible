And Joseph's brothers came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph saw his brothers, and he knew them, but made himself strange to them, and spoke roughly with them; and he said to them. From where do you{+} come? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Joseph knew his brothers, but they didn't know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said to them, You{+} are spies; to see the nakedness of the land you{+} have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they said to him, No, my lord, but to buy food have your slaves come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>We are all sons of one man; we are true men, your slaves are no spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land you{+} have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they said, We your slaves are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, look, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph said to them, That is it that I spoke to you{+}, saying, You{+} are spies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>hereby you{+} will be proved: by the life of Pharaoh you{+} will not go forth from here, except your{+} youngest brother come here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Send one of you{+}, and let him fetch your{+} brother, and you{+} will be bound, that your{+} words may be proved, whether there is truth in you{+}: otherwise by the life of Pharaoh surely you{+} are spies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he put them all together into ward three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joseph said to them the third day, Do this, and live: for I fear God:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>if you{+} are true men, let one of your{+} brothers be bound in your{+} prison-house; but you{+} go, carry grain for the famine of your{+} houses:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and bring your{+} youngest brother to me; so will your{+} words be verified, and you{+} will not die. And they did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he pled with us for mercy, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Reuben answered them, saying, Didn't I speak to you{+}, saying, Don't sin against the child; and you{+} would not hear? Therefore also, look, his blood is required.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they didn't know that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was it done to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as one of them opened his sack to give his donkey fodder in the lodging-place, he noticed his money; and, look, it was in the mouth of his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to his brothers, My money is restored; and, look, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God has done to us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they came to Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And we said to him, We are true men; we are no spies:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>we are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, Hereby will I know that you{+} are true men: leave one of your{+} brothers with me, and take [grain for] the famine of your{+} houses, and go your{+} way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and bring your{+} youngest brother to me: then I will know that you{+} are no spies, but that you{+} are true men: so I will deliver you{+} your{+} brother, and you{+} will traffic in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, look, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Jacob their father said to them, You{+} have bereaved me of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you{+} will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Reuben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I don't bring him to you: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to you again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, My son will not go down with you{+}; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which you{+} go, then you{+} will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
