And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I am a stranger and a sojourner with you{+}. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you{+}, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Please hear us, my lord. You are a prince of God among us. In the choice of our tombs bury your dead. None of us will withhold from you his tomb that you may bury your dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the sons of Heth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he communed with them, saying, If it is your{+} mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you{+} for a possession of a burying-place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the sons of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the sons of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate of his city, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Please, my lord, hear me. The field I give you, and the cave that is in it, I give it you. In the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you. Bury your dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if you will, I pray you, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Ephron answered Abraham, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Please my lord, listen to me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between me and you? Bury therefore your dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Abraham listened to Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current [money] with the merchant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all its border round about, were made sure</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the field, and the cave that is in it, were made sure to Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the sons of Heth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
