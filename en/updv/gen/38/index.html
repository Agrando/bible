And he took her, and went in to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And she became pregnant, and gave birth to a son; and he named him Er.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And she became pregnant again, and gave birth to a son; and she named him Onan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Yahweh. And Yahweh slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Judah said to Onan, Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed to your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, whenever he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and he slew him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah my son is grown up; for he said, Or else he will also die, like his brothers. And Tamar went and remained in her father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his companion Hirah the Adullamite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it was told Tamar, saying, Look, your father-in-law goes up to Timnah to shear his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn't given to him as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a prostitute; for she had covered her face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he turned to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray you, let me come in to you: for he didn't know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What will you give me, that you may come in to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, I will send you a young goat from the flock. And she said, Will you give me a security deposit, until you send it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, What security deposit shall I give you? And she said, Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand. And he gave them to her, and had sex with her, and she became pregnant by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Judah sent the young goat by the hand of his companion the Adullamite, to receive the security deposit from the woman's hand: but he didn't find her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There has been no prostitute here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he returned to Judah, and said, I haven't found her; and also the men of the place said, There has been no prostitute here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Judah said, Let her take it to her, or else we will be put to shame: look, I sent this young goat, and you haven't found her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has prostituted; and moreover, look, she's pregnant by prostitution. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, I am pregnant: and she said, Discern, I pray you, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She's more righteous than I; since I didn't give her to Shelah my son. And he didn't have any sex with her again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, look, twins were in her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, look, his brother came out: and she said, Why have you made a breach for yourself? Therefore his name was called Perez.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread on his hand: and his name was called Zerah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
