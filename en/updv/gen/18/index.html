And they said, Do so, as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, Quickly make ready three seahs of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf, and gave it to the attendant; and he hurried to dress it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? And he said, Look, in the tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I will certainly return to you when the season comes around; and, see, Sarah your wife will have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Abraham and Sarah were old, [and] well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Sarah laughed inside herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Yahweh said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the set time I will return to you, when the season comes around, and Sarah will have a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Sarah denied [it], saying, I didn't laugh; for she was afraid. And he said, No; but you did laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Yahweh said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>seeing that Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For I have known him, to the end that he may command his sons and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has spoken of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Yahweh said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to its [Sodom's] cry, which has come to me; and if not, I will know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Abraham drew near, and said, Will you consume the righteous with the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Perhaps there are fifty righteous inside the city: will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Far be that from you to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous should be as the wicked; far be that from you: will not the Judge of all the earth do right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Yahweh said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous inside the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham answered and said, Seeing now that I have taken on myself to speak to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>perhaps there will lack five of the fifty righteous: will you destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Perhaps there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak: perhaps there will be thirty found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Seeing now that I have taken on myself to speak to the Lord: perhaps there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said, Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: perhaps ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
