Or else, he will come and strike me, from mother to sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you said, I will surely do you good, and make your seed as the sand of the sea, which will be too many to count.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-donkeys and ten foals.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he delivered them into the hand of his slaves, every drove by itself, and said to his slaves, Pass over before me, and put a space between drove and drove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, saying, Whose are you? And where do you go? And whose are these before you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then you will say [They are] your slave Jacob's; it is a present sent to my lord Esau: and, look, he also is behind us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all who followed the droves, saying, In this manner you{+} will speak to Esau, when you{+} find him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and you{+} will say, Moreover, look, your slave Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; perhaps he will accept me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two female slaves, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he saw that he didn't prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, except you bless me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Your name will not be Jacob anymore, but Israel: for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray you, your name. And he said, Why is it that you ask for my name? And he blessed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, [he said], I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the sun rose on him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped on his thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Therefore the sons of Israel don't eat the sinew of the hip which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
