And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he wept aloud: and Egypt heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brothers could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Joseph said to his brothers, Come near to me, I pray you{+}. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your{+} brother, whom you{+} sold into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now don't be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you{+} sold me here: for God sent me before you{+} to preserve life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For these two years has the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God sent me before you{+} to preserve you{+} a remnant in the earth, and to save you{+} alive by a great deliverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So now it wasn't you{+} who sent me here, but God: and he has made me Father of Pharaoh, and Lord of All His House, and Ruler Over All The Land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You{+} hurry, and go up to my father, and say to him, Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt: come down to me, don't tarry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and you will dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near to me, you, and your sons, and the sons of your sons, and your flocks, and your herds, and all that you have:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and there I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine; or else you will come to poverty, you, and your household, and all that you have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, look, your{+} eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you{+} will tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that you{+} have seen: and you{+} will hurry and bring down my father here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept on his neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he kissed all his brothers, and wept on them: and after that his brothers talked with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And its report was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers have come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your brothers, You{+} do this: lade your{+} beasts, and go, you{+} get to the land of Canaan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and take your{+} father and your{+} households, and come to me: and I will give you{+} the good of the land of Egypt, and you{+} will eat the fat of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now you are commanded, this you{+} do: you{+} take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your{+} little ones, and for your{+} wives, and bring your{+} father, and come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also don't regard your{+} stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours{+}.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And to his father he sent after this manner: ten donkeys laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-donkeys laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he sent his brothers away, and they departed: and he said to them, See that you{+} don't fall out by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan to Jacob their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he didn't believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
