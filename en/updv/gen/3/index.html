And he said to the woman, has God really said, You{+} will not eat of any tree of the garden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, You{+} will not eat of it, neither will you{+} touch it, or else you{+} will die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the serpent said to the woman, You{+} will not surely die:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>for God knows that in the day you{+} eat of it, then your{+} eyes will be opened, and you{+} will be as God, knowing good and evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit, and ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, Where are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you that you should not eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Yahweh God said to the woman, What is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Yahweh God said to the serpent, Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; on your belly you will go, and dust you will eat all the days of your life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed: he will bruise your head, and you will bruise his heel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply your pain and your conception; in pain you will bring forth sons; and your desire will be to your husband, and he will rule over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And to Adam he said, Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying, You will not eat of it: cursed is the ground for your sake; in toil you will eat of it all the days of your life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>thorns also and thistles it will bring forth to you; and you will eat the herb of the field;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in the sweat of your face you will eat bread, until you return to the ground; for out of it were you taken: for dust you are, and to dust you will return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Yahweh God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Yahweh God said, Look, the man has become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, so that he doesn't put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever--</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>therefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he drove out the man; and he caused the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to stay at the east of the garden of Eden to keep the way of the tree of life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
