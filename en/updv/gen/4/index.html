And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Abel, he also brought of the firstborns of his flock and of its fat. And Yahweh had respect to Abel and to his offering:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but to Cain and to his offering he did not have respect. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Yahweh said to Cain, Why are you angry? And why is your countenance fallen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If you do well, will it not be lifted up? And if you do not well, sin is crouching at the door: and to you will be its desire, but you will rule over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Yahweh said to Cain, Where is Abel your brother? And he said, I don't know: am I my brother's keeper?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood cries to me from the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now cursed are you from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>from now on when you till the ground, it will not yield its strength to you; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Cain said to Yahweh, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Look, you have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from your face I will be hid; and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whoever finds me will slay me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Yahweh said to him, Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold. And Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain, lest anyone finding him should strike him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Cain had sex with his wife; and she became pregnant, and gave birth to Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begot Mehujael: and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lamech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of bronze and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Lamech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; You{+} wives of Lamech, listen to my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If Cain will be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Adam had sex with his wife; and she bore a son, and named him Seth. For, [she said], God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he named him Enosh. Then it was begun to call on the name of Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
