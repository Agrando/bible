And she named him Gad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Zilpah Leah's slave bore Jacob a second son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Leah said, I am happy! For the daughters will call me happy: and she named him Asher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray you, of your son's mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she said to her, Is it a small matter that you have taken away my husband? And would you take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he will lie with you tonight for your son's mandrakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, You must come in to me; for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God listened to Leah, and she became pregnant, and bore Jacob a fifth son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Leah said, God has given me my wages, because I gave my slave to my husband: and she named him Issachar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Leah became pregnant again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Leah said, God has endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she named him Zebulun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterward she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And she became pregnant, and gave birth to a son: and said, God has taken away my reproach:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and she named him Joseph, saying, Yahweh add to me another son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go: for you know my service with which I have served you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Laban said to him, If now I have found favor in your eyes, [tarry]: [for] I have used magic and [found that] Yahweh has blessed me for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said, Appoint me your wages, and I will give it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to him, You know how I have served you, and how your cattle have fared with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For you had little before I came, and it has increased to a multitude; and Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You will not give me anything: if you will do this thing for me, I will again shepherd your flock and keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and [of such] will be my wages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So will my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when you will come concerning my wages that are before you: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that [if found] with me, will be counted stolen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Laban said, Agreed, let it be according to your word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and he set three days' journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob shepherded the rest of Laban's flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jacob took for himself rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he set the rods which he had peeled across from the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and didn't put them to Laban's flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it came to pass, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but when the flock was feeble, he didn't put them in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and female slaves and male slaves, and camels and donkeys.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
