And they said to Pharaoh, Your slaves are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they said to Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land we have come; for there is no pasture for your slaves' flocks; for the famine is intense in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray you, let your slaves dwell in the land of Goshen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, They may dwell in the land of Goshen. And if you know that there are among them capable men, put them in charge of my herds. And Jacob and his sons came to Egypt to Joseph, and Pharaoh the king of Egypt heard it. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Your father and your brothers have come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Look, the land of Egypt is before you. You may settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Pharaoh said to Jacob, How many are the days of the years of your life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they haven't attained to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very intense, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in your presence? For [our] money fails.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Joseph said, Give your{+} cattle; and I will give it to you{+} for your{+} cattle, if you{+} are out of money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they brought their cattle to Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land not be desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was intense on them: and the land became Pharaoh's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for the people, he made them slaves from one end of the border of Egypt even to its other end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Only the land of the priests he didn't buy: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they didn't sell their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then Joseph said to the people, Look, I have bought you{+} this day and your{+} land for Pharaoh: look, here is seed for you{+}, and you{+} will sow the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it will come to pass at the ingatherings, that you{+} will give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your{+} own, for seed of the field, and for your{+} food, and for them of your{+} households, and for food for your{+} little ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said, You have saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they got possessions in it, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight, put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: don't bury me, I pray you, in Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but when I sleep with my fathers, you will carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Swear to me: and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself on the head of the bed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
