And the Canaanite was then in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Yahweh appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed I will give this land: and there he built an altar to Yahweh, who appeared to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he removed from there to the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he built an altar to Yahweh, and called on the name of Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was intense in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, when he came near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Now see, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look at:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians will see you, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save you alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Say, I pray you, you are my sister; that it may be well with me for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass, that, when Abram came into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-donkeys, and male slaves, and female slaves, and she-donkeys, and camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that you have done to me? Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Why did you say, She's my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? Now therefore here is your wife, take her, and go your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
