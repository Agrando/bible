Everyone who hears will laugh with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah should nurse sons? For I have borne him a son in his old age.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore she said to Abraham, Cast out this slave and her son. For the son of this slave will not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said to Abraham, Don't let it be grievous in your sight because of the lad, and because of your slave. In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice. For in Isaac will your seed be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And also of the son of the slave I will make into a nation, because he is your seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and [gave her] the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And she went, and she sat down across from him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Don't let me see the child's death. And she sat opposite him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God heard the voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said to her, What ails you, Hagar? Don't be afraid. For God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in your hand. For I will make him a great nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now therefore swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done to you, you will do to me, and to the land in which you have sojourned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Abraham said, I will swear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's slaves had violently taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Abimelech said, I don't know who has done this thing. You did not tell me, and I had not heard of it yet, but today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech. And the two made a covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Abimelech said to Abraham, What do these seven ewe lambs mean which you have set by themselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, These seven ewe lambs you will take of my hand, that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba. Because there they swore both of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and there called on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
