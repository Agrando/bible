And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>[And] when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Get up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, Why have you{+} rewarded evil for good?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Isn't this that in which my lord drinks, and by which he indeed uses it for magic? You{+} have done evil in so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they said to him, Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your slaves that they should do such a thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Look, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of your lord's house silver or gold?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With whomever of your slaves it is found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said, Now also let it be according to your{+} words: he with whom it is found will be my slave; and you{+} will be innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then they hurried, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his donkey, and returned to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you{+} have done? Don't you{+} know that a man such as I can indeed use magic [to find out]?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? What shall we speak? Or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your slaves: look, we are my lord's slaves, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my slave but as for you{+}, you{+} get up in peace to your{+} father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh, my lord, let your slave, I pray you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and don't let your anger burn against your slave; for you are even as Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My lord asked his slaves, saying, Have you{+} a father, or a brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And you said to your slaves, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And we said to my lord, The lad can't leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you said to your slaves, Except your{+} youngest brother come down with you{+}, you{+} will see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it came to pass when we came up to your slave my father, we told him the words of my lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And we said, We can't go down: if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother is with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And your slave my father said to us, You{+} know that my wife bore me two sons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I haven't seen him since:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and if you{+} take this one also from me, and harm befalls him, you{+} will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now therefore when I come to your slave my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>it will come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not there, that he will die: and your slaves will bring down the gray hairs of your slave our father with sorrow to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For your slave became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I don't bring him to you, then I will bear the blame to my father forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now therefore, let your slave, I pray you, remain instead of the lad a slave to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad is not with me? Or else, I will see the evil that will come upon my father.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
