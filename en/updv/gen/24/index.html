And Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Abraham said to his slave, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But you will go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the slave said to him, Perhaps the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land. Must I bring your son again to the land from where you came?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Abraham said to him, You be careful not to bring my son there again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke to me, and who swore to me, saying, To your seed I will give this land. He will send his angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you will be free from this my oath. Only you will not bring my son there again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the slave put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the slave took ten camels, of the camels of his master, having all good things of his master's in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, O Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray you, success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Look, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I will say, Let down your pitcher, I pray you, that I may drink. And she will say, Drink, and I will give your camels to drink also. Let the same be she who you have appointed for your slave Isaac. And by this will I know that you have shown kindness to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass, before he had finished speaking, that, look, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the damsel was very fair to look at, a virgin, neither had any man had any sex with her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the slave ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when she was done giving him to drink, she said, I will draw for your camels also, until they are done drinking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And she hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the man looked steadfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it came to pass, as the camels were done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and said, Whose daughter are you? Tell me, I pray you. Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>She said moreover to him, We have both straw and fodder enough, and room to lodge in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not forsaken his loving-kindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of my master's brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the fountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me. That he came to the man. And, look, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, Come in, you blessed of Yahweh. Why do you stand outside? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and fodder for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there was set food before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, I am Abraham's slave.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Yahweh has blessed my master greatly. And he has become great. And he has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and male slaves and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master when she was old. And to him he has given all that he has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And my master made me swear, saying, You will not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But you will go to my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And I said to my master, Perhaps the woman will not follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said to me, Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way. And you will take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then you will be free from my oath, when you come to my kindred. And if they don't give her to you, you will be free from my oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I came this day to the fountain, and said, O Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Look, I am standing by the fountain of water. And let it come to pass, that the young woman that comes forth to draw, to whom I will say, Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And she will say to me, Both drink you, and I will also draw for your camels. Let the same be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed for my master's son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And before I had finished speaking in my heart, look, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down to the fountain, and drew. And I said to her, Let me drink, I pray you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And she hurried, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels to drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels to drink also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him. And I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And now if you{+} will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me. That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from Yahweh. We can't speak to you bad or good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Look, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master's son's wife, as Yahweh has spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's slave heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And the slave brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they ate and drank, he and the men who were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel remain with us [a few] days, at the least ten. After that she will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And he said to them, Don't hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's slave, and his men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, Our sister, be [the mother] of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed possess the gate of those who hate them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode on the camels, and followed the man. And the slave took Rebekah, and went his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at evening. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and noticed that there were camels coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from the camel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And she said to the slave, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the slave said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And the slave told Isaac all the things that he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
