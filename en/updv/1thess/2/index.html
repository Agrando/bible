But we became juveniles among you{+}, as when a nurse cherishes her own children:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>even so, being affectionately desirous of you{+}, we were well pleased to impart to you{+}, not the good news of God only, but also our own souls, because you{+} became very dear to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For you{+} remember, brothers, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you{+}, we preached to you{+} the good news of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You{+} are witnesses, and God [also], how holily and righteously and unblamably we became toward you{+} who believe:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>as you{+} know how we [dealt with] each one of you{+}, as a father with his own children,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>exhorting you{+}, and encouraging, and testifying, to the end that you{+} should walk worthily of God, who calls you{+} into his own kingdom and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And for this cause we also thank God without ceasing, that, when you{+} received from us the word of the message, [even the word] of God, you{+} accepted [it] not [as] the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which also works in you{+} who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For you{+}, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus: for you{+} also suffered the same things of your{+} own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who both killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove out us, and did not please God, and are contrary to all men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But we, brothers, being bereaved of you{+} for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your{+} face with great desire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>because we wanted to come to you{+}, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even you{+}, before our Lord Jesus at his coming?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you{+} are our glory and our joy.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
