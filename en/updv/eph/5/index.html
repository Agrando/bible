Therefore [he] says, Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Look therefore carefully how you{+} walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore don't be{+} foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And don't be drunk with wine, in which is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your{+} heart to the Lord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wives, [be in subjection] to your{+} own husbands, as to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, [being] himself the savior of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But as the church is subject to Christ, so [let] the wives also [be] to their husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your{+} wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>that he might present the church to himself a glorious [church], not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies.
