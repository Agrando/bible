Not so. But sin I had not learned (to know) but by the law: for I had not known concupiscence (to be sinful), but (by) the law, which hath said, Thou shalt not covet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And by this commandment sin found for itself an occasion, and completed in me all concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I was alive without the law formerly: but when the commandment came, sin lived, and I died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And that commandment of life was found to me (to tend) unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, by the occasion it found through the commandment, deceived me, and thereby killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The law therefore is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The good, then, unto me, unto death was made? Not so. But sin, that it might be seen what sin is, by the good (law) effected death in me, that sin might be the more condemned by the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, and sold unto sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For what I work, I know not; and not that which I will, I do; but what I hate, that I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if the thing that I would not, I do, I witness of the law that it is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But now it is not I who work this, but sin which dwelleth in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me, but that is in my flesh, good dwelleth not; because to will the good is easy to me, but to perform it I find not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good that I will to do, I do not; but the evil that I will not to do, that do I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if the thing that I will not I do, it is not I who do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find then a law which accordeth with my mind, that willeth to do good, because evil is near to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I rejoice in the law of Aloha in the interior man;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I see another law in my members, which warreth against the law of my mind, making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I give thanks to Aloha! (it is) by the hand of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha. Now then, I in my mind am the servant of the law of Aloha, but in my flesh I am the servant of the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
