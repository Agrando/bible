For how shall they who are dead to sin live yet in it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Or do you not know, that they who have been baptized into Jeshu Meshiha, into his death have been baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For we are buried with him by baptism into death; that as Jeshu Meshiha arose from among the dead by the glory of his Father, so also we in a new life shall walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For if together we have been planted with him in the likeness of his death, so also in his resurrection shall we be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For we know that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be abolished, that more we should not serve sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For he who is dead is set free from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>If then we are dead with the Meshiha, we believe that with him, with the Meshiha, we shall live:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for we know that the Meshiha rose from among the dead, and no more dieth, nor hath death dominion over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he who died on account of sin died once, and he who liveth liveth unto Aloha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>so also reckon yourselves to be dead unto sin, and alive unto Aloha by our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Let not sin then reign in your dead body, as that you may obey the lusts of it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>nor prepare your members the instruments of iniquity unto sin, but prepare yourselves for Aloha, as men who from the dead have been made alive, and your members instruments to be for the righteousness of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For sin shall not rule over you; for you are not under law, but under grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What, then, shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? Not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know you not, that to whomsoever you prepare yourselves to obey him unto service, of him you are the servants, of him whom you obey; whether of sin, or of the hearing of the ear of righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But praise to Aloha that you were the servants of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine to which you have been delivered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when you were made free from sin, you became obedient to righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As among men I speak, because of the infirmity of your flesh, that as you have prepared your members for the service of uncleanness and of iniquity, so also now prepare ye your members for the service of righteousness and of holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what product had you then from that of which to-day you are ashamed? For the end of it is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now made free from sin, and become servants to Aloha, you have holy fruits, of which the end is the life of eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the wages of sin is death; and the gift of Aloha the life of eternity by our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
