Nigh thee is the word of thy mouth and of thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if thou wilt confess with thy mouth our Lord Jeshu, and wilt believe with thy heart that Aloha hath raised him from among the dead, thou shalt be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the heart which believeth in him is justified, and the mouth which confesseth him is saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the scripture saith, that every one who believeth in him shall not be ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in this he hath not distinguished nor the Jihudoya nor the Aramoya; for one is the Lord of them all, who is rich toward every one who calleth on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For every one who shall invoke the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then shall they invoke him in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? Or how shall they hear without a preacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Or how shall they preach if they are not sent? As it is written, How beautiful the feet of them who evangelize peace, And who evangelize good things!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But all of them have not obeyed the preaching of the gospel: for Eshaia saith, My Lord, who hath believed our voice?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore faith is from the hearing of the ear, and the hearing of the ear from the word of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, Have they not heard? Behold, in all the earth their voice hath gone forth, And to the ends of the world their words!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, Hath not Israel known? First, Musha thus speaketh, I will provoke you by a people who is not a people. And by the disobedient people will I make you angry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Eshaia is bold, and saith, I am beheld by them who have not sought me, And found of them who for me have not inquired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But of Israel he saith, I have stretched out my hands all the day To a contentious and disobedient people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
