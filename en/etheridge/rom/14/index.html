But standing, he standeth; for there is power in the hands of his Lord to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>There is who distinguisheth day from day, and there is who judgeth all days (to be alike); but let every man in the conviction of his (own) mind be confirmed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who thinketh of the day, to his Lord he thinketh; and every one who thinketh not of the day, unto his Lord he thinketh not (of it). He who eateth, to his Lord he eateth, and to Aloha giveth thanks;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and he who eateth not, to his Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to Aloha. For there is no one of us who to himself liveth and no one who to himself dieth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if we live, to our Lord we live; and if we die, to our Lord we die: and if we live, then, or if we die, our Lord's are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Because of this also the Meshiha died and lived and arose, that he might be Lord of the dead and of the living. But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or thou, also, why despisest thou thy brother? For we shall all stand before the tribunal of the Meshiha:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>as it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, unto me every knee shall bow, and to me shall every tongue confess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, every one of us the answer for himself shall give unto Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then judge not one another, but this determine rather, to lay not a stumbling-block for thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jeshu, that a thing which is unclean from itself is not (so); but to him who judgeth of any thing that it is polluted, to him only it is polluted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if on account of meat thou grievest thy brother, thou walkest not in love: destroy not by thy meat him on account of whom the Meshiha died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Let not our good (things) be blasphemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of Aloha is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Spirit of Holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For who in these things serveth the Meshiha pleaseth Aloha, and before men is approved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now, after peace let us pursue, and after the edification of one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and not for the sake of meats undo the work of Aloha. For each thing is pure, yet evil is it to the man who eateth with offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is well not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing by which our brother is offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hast thou confidence? In thyself retain it before Aloha. Blessed is he who condemneth not himself in what he distinguisheth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he who doubteth and eateth is made guilty, because he eateth not with confidence. For every thing that is not of confidence is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
