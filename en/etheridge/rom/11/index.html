Not so. For I also am of Israel, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benyamen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Aloha hath not put away his people whom from before he knew. Or know you not what he saith in the scripture concerning Elia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>when he cried unto Aloha against Israel, saying, My Lord, thy prophets have they killed, and thy altars overthrown, and I alone am left, and they seek my soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it was said to him by revelation, Behold, I have left to myself seven thousand men, who upon their knees have not kneeled nor worshipped Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So also, at this time, a residue is left by the election of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if by grace, it is not of works; otherwise grace is not grace. But if by works, it is not of grace; otherwise work is not work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then, That which Israel sought he hath not found; but the election hath found: but the rest of them are blinded in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>As it is written, Aloha hath given them the spirit of trouble, And eyes that see not, and ears that hear not, until the present day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David again saith, Let their table become a snare before them, And their reward be for a stumbling-block:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And their back at all times be bowed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I say, Have they stumbled so as to fall? Not so: but, by their stumbling was salvation to the Gentiles, unto their zeal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if their stumbling were wealth to the world, and their condemnation wealth to the Gentiles, how much then will their fulness be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>To you, Gentiles, I speak, I, who am apostle of the Gentiles, in my ministry I glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if I may provoke my fleshly kindred, and save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if their rejection was the reconciliation of the world, what (will) their conversion (be) but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the first-fruits be holy, (so) also (will be) the mass; and if the root be holy, (so) also the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if the branches were cut off, and thou who art a wild olive art engrafted in their place, and hast a participation of the root and fatness of the olive,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>boast not against the branches: but if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root beareth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And perhaps thou wilt say, The branches were cut off, and I in their place am engrafted:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Well, they on account of unbelief were cut off, and thou by faith standest: be not exalted in thy mind, but fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>If Aloha spared not them who were branches by nature, (take heed) lest he spare not thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, then, the goodness and the severity of Aloha: towards them who fell, severity; but towards thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness; if not, thou also wilt be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they, if they continue not in their want of faith, they also shall be engrafted; for Aloha is able again to engraft them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if thou who art of the wild olive which is thy nature, wast cut off, and, which was not thy nature, art engrafted into the good olive, how much more they, if they are engrafted into the olive of their nature?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But I would have you know, my brethren, this mystery, that you may not be wise in your own mind,-that blindness of heart for a little space is unto Israel until the fulness of the Gentiles be brought in:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and then all Israel shall be saved. As it is written, The Redeemer shall come from Sion, And turn iniquity from Jakub;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then shall be to them my covenant, When I have forgiven them their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But, in (regard of) the gospel, they are enemies on your account; and, in the election, they are beloved on account of the fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For Aloha turneth not in his gift and in his vocation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as you also were not obedient unto Aloha at the first, and now have received mercy through their disobedience;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so also these are now disobedient for the mercy that is upon you, that upon them also might be mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For Aloha hath included them all in disobedience, that upon all he might show mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of Aloha, whose judgments man searcheth not, and whose ways are inscrutable!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counsellor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Or who hath first given to him, that so he should receive from him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For all is of him, and all in him, and all by him. To him be praises and benedictions unto the age of ages. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
