Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>FOR the word of Aloha hath not really fallen: for not all who are of Israel are Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>neither also are they who are of the seed of Abraham all children; because it was said, In Ishok shall be called unto thee the seed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but that is, the children of the flesh are not the children of Aloha, but the children of the promise are reckoned the seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the promise is this word, In this time I will come, and a son shall be unto Sara.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not this only, but also Raphka when with one, our father Ishok, she had association,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>before her sons were born, and had not wrought good or evil, the (choice) of Aloha was (made) known before that it should remain: not by works, but by him who called:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for it was said, The elder shall be servant to the less;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>as it is written, Jakub have I loved, and Isu have I hated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What then say we? Is there iniquity with Aloha? Not so:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>behold, also, he said unto Musha, I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore it is not by him who willeth, nor by him who runneth, but by Aloha the Merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is said in the scripture to Pherun, For this I have raised thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then upon whom he willeth he is merciful, and whom he willeth he hardeneth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Perhaps thou wilt say, Of what then doth he complain; for who shall arise against his will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Who then art thou, O man, who givest answer against Aloha? Will the mass say to him who formeth it, Why thus hast thou formed me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or, hath not the potter power over his clay, that from the (same) mass he might make vessels, the one to honour, and the other to vileness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>BUT if Aloha, willing to reveal his wrath, and to make known his power, in his much patience bore with the vessels of wrath who were perfected for destruction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and poured his mercy upon the vessels of mercy who were prepared of Aloha for glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who are we, (ourselves) the called, not only of the Jihudoyee, but also of the Gentiles:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>so also in Husha he said, I will call them my people who were not my people, and on those on whom I was not merciful, will I be merciful:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for it shall be in the place where they were not called my people, there shall they be called the children of Aloha the Living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Eshaia proclaims of the sons of Israel: Though the number of the sons of Israel were as the sand which is on the sea, the residue of them shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The Lord hath decreed and determined the word, and will perform it upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as that which Eshaia had said before: Unless the Lord of sebaoth had left to us a residue, as Sedum should we have been, and to Amura have been likened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>WHAT then shall we say? That the Gentiles who have not followed after righteousness have attained righteousness, but that righteousness which is of faith:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but Israel, who followed after the law of righteousness, unto the law of righteousness have not attained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For why? Because it was not by faith, but by the works of the law: for they stumbled at the stone of stumbling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>as it is written, Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling And a rock of offence; And whosoever in him shall believe Shall not be ashamed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
