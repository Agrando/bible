Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>WHEREFORE Aloha delivered them up to passions of vileness: for their females changed the use of their nature, and to what is not natural were used.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And also their males likewise left the natural use of their females, and were inflamed with concupiscence one with another, and male with male wrought shamefulness, and the just retribution for their perverseness in themselves received.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And as they did not decide in themselves to know Aloha, so did Aloha cause them to be delivered up to a mind of vainness, and to do what is not fit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>being filled with all wickedness, and uncleanness, and rancour, and malice, and rapacity, and envy, and murder, and contention, and deceit, and evil imaginings, and murmurings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and slanders, and hating of Aloha: vilifiers, inflated ones, boasters, inventors of evil things, mindless, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>(men) to whom a compact is nothing, and (who) neither love peace nor (have) mercy in them; who,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>knowing the judgment of Aloha, that they who these things do, unto death are condemned, (yet) not only do them, but also participate with those who do them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
