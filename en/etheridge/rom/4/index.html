That Abraham believed Aloha, and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But to him who worketh, his wages are not reckoned to him as of favour, but as that which is owing to him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but to him who worketh not, but believeth only in him who justifieth sinners, his faith is reckoned to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As also David hath spoken concerning the blessedness of the man to whom Aloha reckoneth righteousness without works, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Blessed are they whose iniquity is forgiven, And whose sins are covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed is the man to whom Aloha reckoneth not his sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Is this blessedness, then, upon the circumcision (only), or upon the uncircumcision (also)? Now we have said, that his faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When, then, was it reckoned to him? In circumcision or in uncircumcision? It was not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he received the sign of circumcision (as) a seal of the righteousness of his faith, which (was his) in uncircumcision, that he should be the father of all them who believe of the uncircumcision; that it might be accounted also to them for righteousness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the father of the circumcision, not of them who are of the circumcision only, but of them who pursue the footsteps of the faith of uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>FOR not through the law was the promise unto Abraham and to his seed that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if they who are of the law were heirs, faith would be vain, and the promise be abolished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the law is the worker of wrath. For where there is no law, there also is no transgression of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore it is by faith, which is through grace, that we are justified, that the promise might be firm unto all his seed; not to that which is of the law only, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(as it is written, I have ordained thee the father of many nations before Aloha, in whom thou hast believed, who maketh alive the dead, and calleth those who are not as though they were:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and who, without hope, unto hope believed that he should be the father of many nations, as it is written, that " so shall be thy seed."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Nor was he weak in his faith, while considering his body dead, (for he was the son of an hundred years,) and the dead womb of Sara;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and at the promise of Aloha he wavered not as deficient in faith, but was strong in faith, and gave glory to Aloha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and was sure that what he had promised to him Aloha could fulfil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore it was reckoned to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And not for his sake only was this written, that his faith was reckoned for righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but for our sake, because it should be reckoned to us also who believe in Him who hath raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was delivered for our sins, and rose that he might justify us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
