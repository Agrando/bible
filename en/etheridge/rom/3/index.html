Is Aloha evil, who bringeth his wrath? As a man do I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Not so; otherwise how shall Aloha judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For if the truth of Aloha is promoted by my lie unto his glory, why then am I judged as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Or why, as certain blaspheme concerning us, affirming that we say, Let us do evil, that good may come? they, whose condemnation is reserved by justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then, have we attained excellence? (No.) For before we decided of the Jihudoyee and of the Aramoyee that they are all under sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>as it is written, None is righteous, not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>None understandeth or seeketh Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All have declined together and are reprobate, And there is none that doeth good, not one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Open sepulchres are their throats, Their tongues have deceived, And the venom of asps is under their lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And their feet are swift to shed blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Crushing and misery are in their ways;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the way of peace they have not known;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fear of Aloha is not before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>BUT we know that whatever the law saith, to them who are under the law it saith: that every mouth may be shut, and all the world be guilty unto Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Because by the works of the law no flesh is justified before him; for from the law sin is known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now, without the law the righteousness of Aloha is revealed, and the law and the prophets (themselves) testify of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the righteousness of Aloha is by faith of Jeshu Meshiha, unto all and also upon all who believe in him. For there is no distinction:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for all have sinned, and have failed of the glory of Aloha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and all are justified by grace freely, and (that) through the redemption which is in Jeshu Meshiha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom Aloha before ordained (to be) a propitiation through faith in his blood for our sins which from the first we had sinned, within the space which Aloha hath given to us in his patience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>unto the manifestation of his righteousness which (is) in this time: that he might be just, and might justify in righteousness him who is in the faith of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Where, then, is boasting? It is abolished. By what law? of works? No, but by the law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>We comprehend, therefore, that by faith man is justified, and not by the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Is Aloha of the Jihudoyee only, and not of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because one is Aloha, who justifieth the circumcision by faith, also the uncircumcision by the same faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Do we therefore the law abolish by faith? Not so, but the law itself we establish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
