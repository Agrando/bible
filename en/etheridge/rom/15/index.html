As it is written, I will confess thee among the Gentiles, And to thy name will I sing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And again he hath said, Be glad, ye Gentiles, with his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And again he hath said, Praise the Lord, all (ye) Gentiles; Let all peoples praise him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And again, Eshaia hath said, There shall be a root of Jeshai, And he who shall arise shall be the chief of the peoples; And upon him will the Gentiles hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace, through faith, that you may abound in hope through the power of the Spirit of Holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>BUT I am persuaded also concerning you, my brethren, that you are also full of good, and filled with all knowledge, and able also to instruct others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I have somewhat boldly written to you, my brethren, as that I may put you in remembrance, through the grace which is given to me from Aloha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to be a minister of Jeshu Meshiha among the Gentiles, and to labour in the gospel of Aloha, that there may be an oblation of the Gentiles, acceptable and holy through the Spirit of Holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have, then, exultation in Jeshu Meshiha with Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I dare not speak any thing which the Meshiha hath not done by my hands, unto the obedience of the Gentiles, in word and in deeds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>with the power of signs and miracles, and with the power of the Spirit of Aloha; as that I have itinerated from Urishlem unto Illyrikum, to fulfil the preaching of Meshiha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>being anxious to preach, not where the name of Meshiha had been called, that I might not build upon another foundation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but as it is written, They to whom it hath not been told of him, they shall see him; and they who have not heard shall be persuaded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On this account I have been hindered many times when I would have come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But now, because I have no place in these countries, and have desired for many years to come to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when I go into Ispania, I hope to come and see you; and you shall lead me thitherward, when I shall in some measure have been gladdened with the sight of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I go to Urishlem to minister to the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For they in Makedunia and in Akaia have desired that a communication should be made from themselves with the poor and the saints who are at Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They have desired (this), because they also are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have participated with them in the Spirit, they are indebted to serve them in the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>This, then, when I have accomplished, and have sealed to them this fruit, I (intend to) pass by you into Ispania.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I know that when I come to you, with the plenitude of the blessing of the gospel of Meshiha I (shall) come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I entreat of you, my brethren, by our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and by the love of the Spirit, to labour with me in prayer on my behalf, with Aloha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be delivered from them who believe not in Jihud, and (that) the service which I bear to the saints may be well received,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and I may come to you with joy in the will of Aloha, and be rested with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The God of peace be with all of you.
