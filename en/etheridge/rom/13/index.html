For there is no power that is not from Aloha, and the powers that be, of Aloha are they instituted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Whoever then riseth up against the power, against the institution of Aloha he riseth; and they who arise against them will receive judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For judges are not a terror to the workers of good, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do good, and thou shalt have praise from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he is the servant of Aloha, but to thee for good: and if thou do evil, fear; for not in vain is he girded with the sword; for he is the servant of Aloha, and the dispenser of wrath to them who do evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And because of this are we bound to be subject, not for the wrath only, but also because of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On this account also give we tribute to them; for they are the servants of Aloha over these things constituted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Render therefore to every man as is due to him: to whom tribute (is due,) tribute; and to whom custom, custom; and to whom reverence, reverence; and to whom honour, honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And to no man owe any thing, but one another to love.
