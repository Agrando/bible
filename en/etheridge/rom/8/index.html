But if a man have not the Spirit of the Meshiha, this (man) is not his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And if the Meshiha be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if the Spirit of him who raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead dwell in you, he who raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead will also make alive your dead bodies, on account of his Spirit who dwelleth in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now, my brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, that according to the flesh we should walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if after the flesh you live, you must die: but if, after the Spirit, the habitudes of the body you mortify, you live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For they who by the Spirit of Aloha are led, they are the sons of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we have not received the spirit of servitude again unto fear, but we have received the Spirit of the adoption of sons, by whom we cry, Father, our Father!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Spirit himself witnesseth with our spirit, that we are the sons of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if sons, heirs also; heirs of Aloha, and the sons of the inheritance of Jeshu Meshiha. For if we suffer with him, with him also shall we be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I consider that the sufferings of this time are not equal to that glory which is to be revealed in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the whole creation hopeth and waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation hath been subjected to vanity, not willingly, but on account of him who subjected her, upon the hope</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that the creation herself also shall be made free from the servitude of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the sons of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that all creatures groan and travail until this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and not only they, but we also who have in us the first-fruit of the Spirit, groan within ourselves, and wait for the adoption, the redemption of our bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For in hope we live: but hope that is seen is not hope; for if we see it, why hope we for it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for that which is not seen, in patience we wait.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So also the Spirit helpeth our infirmity: for what to pray for as we ought we know not; but the Spirit himself prayeth on our behalf in groanings unspoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he who searcheth the hearts, he knoweth the mind of the Spirit, who, according to the will of Aloha, prayeth for the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>BUT we know that those who love Aloha, in every thing he helpeth them for good; them whom he set before that they might be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And from the first he knew them, and signified them in the likeness of the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born of many brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But whom he before signified, them he called; and whom he called, them he justified; and whom he justified, them he glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What then shall we say of these? If Aloha be for us, who is against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And if his Son be spared not, but for all of us delivered him up, how will he not with him give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who is against the chosen of Aloha? Aloha justifieth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who condemneth? The Meshiha hath died and arisen, and is at the right hand of Aloha, and prayeth for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who shall separate us from the love of Meshiha? Affliction, or sorrow, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As it is written: For thee all the day long are we killed, We are reckoned as sheep for the slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But in these we all are victorious by the hand of him who hath loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor authorities, nor powers, nor things subsisting, nor things to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate me from the love of Aloha which is in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
