But they were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he beheld them with indignation, while it grieved him on account of the hardness of their hearts. And he said to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched (it); and his hand straightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Pharishee went out immediately, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jeshu with his disciples went towards the sea: and many people joined him from Galila, and from Jehud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and from Urishlem, and from Edum, and from beyond Jurdan, and from Tsur, and from Tsaidon; great multitudes, who, having heard all that he had done, came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spoke to his disciples to bring a vessel for him, that the crowds might not oppress him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for he had healed multitudes, until they were falling upon him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they who were troubled with impure spirits, when they saw him, fell down, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he strongly prohibited them to make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>AND he ascended a mountain, and called those whom he willed; and they came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he chose twelve to be with him, and to send them to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he named to Shemun the name of Kipha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and upon Jacub bar Zabdai, and Juchanon the brother of Jacub, he set the name of B'nai-regesh, which is, (B'nai-r√¢mo,) Sons of thunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Andreas, and Philipos, and Bar-Thulmai, and Mathai, and Thoma, and Jacub bar Chalphai, and Thadai, and Shemun the Zealous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Jihuda S'carjuta,-he who betrayed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they came to the house: and the assemblies gathered again, so that they could not eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his relatives heard, and came forth to take him; for they said, He hath gone out of himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the Sophree, they who had come down from Urishlem, said, Belzebub is in him, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jeshu called them, and by similitudes said to them, How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if a kingdom against itself be divided, that kingdom cannot stand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and if a house against itself be divided, that house cannot stand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and if Satan rise against Satan, and be divided, he cannot stand, but his end is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No one can enter into the house of the strong, and spoil his goods, unless first the strong one he bind; and then his house he may destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Amen I say to you, That all sin and blasphemy which the sons of men blaspheme may be remitted them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Spirit of Holiness hath no remission for ever, but is condemned to the judgment that is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because they had said that an unclean spirit was in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>AND there came his mother and his brethren, standing without; and they sent to call him to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But the congregation sat about him. And they say to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without inquire for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he answered, and said to them, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And looking upon those who sat with him, he said, Behold my mother, and behold my brethren:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>for whosoever shall do the will of Aloha, he is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
