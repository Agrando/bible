And they were offended with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jeshu said to them, No prophet is despised, unless in his own city, and among his kinsfolk, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he could not do there any miracle, except that upon a few sick he laid his hands, and healed them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he wondered at the defectiveness of their faith. AND he itinerated through the villages, teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he called his twelve, and began to send them two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits to cast them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he instructed them to take nothing for the journey, except a staff only; not a wallet, nor bread, nor brass in their purses;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but be shod with sandals, and not to be clothed with two tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, Into whatsoever house you enter, there be until you go forth from thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And every one who will not receive you, nor hear you, when you are going out from thence, beat off the dust that is beneath your feet for their testimony. And Amen I say to you, That it shall be more tolerable for Sadum and for Amura in the day of the judgment, than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went forth, and preached that they should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And many devils they cast out, and anointed with oil the sick, and healed many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>AND Herodes the king heard concerning Jeshu, for his name had become known; and he said, Juchanon the Baptizer hath risen from among the dead; therefore works of power are wrought by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others said, He is Elia; and others, A prophet as one from the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herodes heard, he said, It is Juchanon whom I beheaded; he hath risen from among the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herodes had sent and had taken Juchanon, and had cast him into the house of the bound, on account of Herodia, wife of Philipos his brother, whom he had taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Juchanon had said to Herodes, It is not lawful to thee to take the wife of thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Herodia herself was adverse to him, and wished to kill him, but she could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For Herodes feared Juchanon, because he knew that he was a man righteous and holy, and he protected him, and was many (times) hearing him, doing, and hearing him favourably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And there was a notable day when Herodes, in the house of his nativity, (b'beth yaldeh,) made a feast to his chiefs and kiliarchs and the heads of Galila;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the daughter of Herodia came in (and) danced; and she pleased Herodes and them who reclined with him. And the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he sware to her, Whatever thou shalt ask (of) me, I will give thee, unto the dividing of my kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then went she out and said to her mother, What shall I ask of him? She saith to her, The head of Juchanon the Baptizer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediately she entered with solicitude unto the king, and saith to him, I will this hour that thou give me, upon a dish, the head of Juchanon the Baptizer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And greatly grieved was the king; but, for the sake of the oath, and the sake of the guests, he could not deprive her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the king despatched at once a sentinel, and commanded that he should bring the head of Juchanon. And he went and cut off the head of Juchanon in the house of the bound,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and brought (it) in a dish and gave to the damsel, and the damsel herself gave to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And his disciples heard and went, took up his corpse, and laid it in the place of the buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>AND the disciples gathered unto Jeshu, and told him all whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to them, Come and let us go into the desert alone, and rest a little while; for there were multitudes going and coming, (so that) they had not space even to eat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they went to a wilderness district in a vessel by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And many saw them as they went, and knew them; and into the waste ran they from all the cities, and were there before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jeshu coming forth beheld the great assemblies, and had compassion upon them, they being like sheep which had no shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when much time had passed, the disciples came to him and said to him, This place is waste, and the time is great;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>send them away to go to the farms around us and into the villages, and buy for themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he said to them, Give you them to eat. They said to him, Shall we go and buy bread for two hundred dinoreen, and give them to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he said, Go see how many loaves you have here; and when they had seen, they said to him, Five loaves and two fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he directed that they should make them all recline in companies upon the herbage;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and they reclined in companies, by hundreds and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the bread, and gave to his disciples to set before them: and those two fishes they divided among them all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they all did eat and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they took up the broken pieces, twelve baskets full, and from the fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now they who had eaten bread were five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And immediately he constrained his disciples to ascend into the bark, and to go before him across to Beth-tsaida, while he dismissed the assemblies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and when he had sent them away, he went to a mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>BUT when it was eventide, the bark was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone upon the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he saw them that they were distressed with rowing; for the wind was against them. And in the fourth watch of the night Jeshu came to them walking upon the waters, (as though) he willed to pass by them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>but they beheld him walking upon the waters, and thought it was a spectre, and they cried out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>for all saw him and were afraid. But he immediately spoke to them and said to them, Take heart, I am, fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he ascended to them into the ship, and the wind was still: and they wondered greatly, and were astonished among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For they understood not from that bread, because their heart was gross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Genesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they had gone forth from the bark, the men of the place at once recognised him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And they ran throughout all that land, and began to bring those who were greatly afflicted, bearing them on couchettes, to where they heard that he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And wherever he entered, into villages and cities, they placed the sick in the streets, and besought from him that they might touch only the edge of his mantle; and all they who touched him were healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
