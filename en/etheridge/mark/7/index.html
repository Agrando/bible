And many other of those (things) there are which they have received to observe, (as) the baptisms of cups, and of measures, and of brasen utensils, and of beds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Sophree and Pharishee questioned him, Why do not your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders; but, while their hands are not washed, eat bread?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he said to them, Well prophesied concerning you Eshaia the prophet, you hypocrites; as it is written, This people with their lips honour me, but their heart is very far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But in vain do they reverence me while they teach the teachings of the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For you have abandoned the commandment of God and hold the tradition of men, as the baptisms of cups and measures, and many things like these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He said to them (moreover), You decently suppress the commandment of God, that you may establish your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Musha hath said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and whosoever curseth father and mother, the death he shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you say, If a man shall say to his father, or to his mother, My oblation, (be that) whatever from me thou mayest profit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and you permit him not to do any thing for his father and his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you reject the word of Aloha for the sake of the tradition which you have delivered: and many similar (observances) to these you practise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jeshu called the whole multitude, and said to them, Hear me, all of you, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It is not that which is without the man, and which entereth into him, that can defile him: but that which proceedeth from him, that defileth a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when Jeshu had gone into the house (apart) from the multitude, his disciples asked him concerning that parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to them, How dull are even you! Know you not, that nothing from without that entereth a man can defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because it entereth not into his heart, but into his belly, and is cast out in the purgation which all food purgeth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But that which proceedeth from a man, that polluteth a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, from the heart of the sons of men, go forth evil thoughts, adultery, fornication, robbery, murder,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>rapacity, malice, fraud, obscenity, an evil eye, blasphemy, vain-glory, folly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>all these evils come from within, and they defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>FROM thence Jeshu arose and went to the confine of Tsur and of Tsaidon, and entered into a certain house: and he was unwilling that any man should know of him, but he could not conceal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For immediately heard a certain woman concerning him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit; and she came, (and) fell before his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But that woman was a Gentile of Phuniki of Suria, and she prayed of him to cast out the demon from her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jeshu said to her, Let the children first be filled; for it is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But she answering said to him, Yes, my Lord, yet the dogs also from beneath the table eat the crumbs of the children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeshu saith to her, Go; on account of that word, the demon hath gone forth from thy daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And she went to her house, and found her daughter lying on the couch, and the demon had gone out from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jeshu again departed from the confine of Tsur and of Tsaidon, and came to the sea of Galila, on the confine of the Ten Cities;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and they brought to him a blind man, a stammerer, and besought him to lay upon him the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took him aside from the crowd by himself, and put his fingers in his ears, and spat, and touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he looked up to heaven, and sighed, and said to him, Be opened:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and in that hour his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plainly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he charged them that to no man they should tell this. But so much as he charged them, they the more proclaimed it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they were exceedingly astonished, and said, He doeth every thing well; the deaf he maketh to hear, and them who spoke not, to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
