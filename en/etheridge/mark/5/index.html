I adjure thee by Aloha, that thou torment me not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For he had said to him, Come forth from the man, unclean spirit!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he questioned him, How is thy name? And he said to him, Legion is our name, because we are many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he besought him much that he would not send him out of the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now at the mountain there was a great herd of swine feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the devils besought him, saying, Send us into those swine, that into them we may enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he suffered them. And those unclean spirits went forth and entered into the swine; and that herd ran to the rock, and plunged into the sea, as two thousand, and were drowned in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they who kept them fled, and told in the city, and also in the hamlets; and they came forth to see what was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came to Jeshu, and saw him who (had had) the devils, sitting, clothed, and sane; him, who had had in him the legion and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they who had seen, related to them what had been done to him who had had the devils, and also concerning those swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they began to beg of him to go from their coast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when he had ascended the vessel, he in whom had been the devils besought him that he might be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But he permitted him not; but said to him, Go to thy house, to thy men, and show them what the Lord hath done for thee, and (how he) hath had mercy on thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he went, and began to preach in the ten cities what Jeshu had done for him: and all marvelled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>AND when Jeshu had passed in the vessel to the opposite side, there were again congregated unto him great gatherings, while he was upon the shore of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And there came one whose name was Jorosh, one of the masters of the synagogue; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and besought him much, saying to him, My daughter is greatly afflicted; come, lay thy hand upon her, and she will be healed, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jeshu went with him; and a great multitude adhered to him, and oppressed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But a certain woman, who had a defluxion of blood twelve years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>who much had suffered from many physicians, and had expended all whatever she had, and was nothing helped, but also the more afflicted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>having heard of Jeshu, came in the press of the crowd behind him, and touched his vestment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For she said, If I but touch his vestment, I shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried; and she felt in her body that she had been healed from her plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Jeshu at once knew within himself that power had gone forth from him, and he turned to the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>His disciples say to him, Thou seest the crowds that oppress thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he looked round to see who this had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the woman herself, fearing and trembling, because she knew what had been done for her, came, fell before him, and told him all the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But he said to her, My daughter, thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace, and be healed from thy plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And while he was speaking, there came some of the house of the master of the synagogue, saying, Thy daughter is dead: for what then art thou wearying the Teacher?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But Jeshu heard the word which they spake, and said to the master of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he did not permit any one to go with him, except Shemun Kipha, and Jacub, and Juchanon, brother of Jacub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they came to the house of that master of the synagogue, and he saw how they made a tumult, and wept and bewailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he entered, and said to them, Why make you a tumult, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they derided him. But Jeshu put them all forth, and took the father of the damsel, and her mother, and those who were with her, and went in where the damsel was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he took the hand of the damsel, and said to her, Damsel, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And forthwith the damsel arose, and walked; for she was a daughter of twelve years. And they wondered with great admiration.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he charged them greatly that no one should know this, and spake that they should give her (somewhat) to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
