With that measure which you mete, you shall have measured to you; and there shall be, added to you those which you hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whosoever hath, unto him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as a man who shall cast seed into the earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and shall sleep, and rise up by night and day, and the seed shall increase, and become long, while he knoweth not,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth yieldeth him fruit; and first is there the plant, and after it the ear, but lastly the completed corn in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit is mature, immediately cometh the sickle, because the harvest is come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he said, To what may we compare the kingdom of Aloha? and with what comparison shall we compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a grain of mustard, which, when sown in the earth, is smaller than all seeds which are in the earth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and when it is sown, it springeth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and maketh great branches; so that in its shadow the fowl can dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In parables such as these spake Jeshu with them, in parables such as they could hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And without parable did he not speak with them: but to his disciples, between him and them, he explained all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>AND he said to them that day, in the evening, Let us pass to the opposite shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they sent away the assembles, and took him into the vessel; and other vessels were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there was a great commotion and wind, and the waves fell upon the vessel, which was nigh being filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jeshu upon a pillow slept in the after-part of the vessel, and they came and raised him, saying to him, Raban, hast thou no care that we are perishing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he arose, and restrained the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be silent. And the wind ceased, and there was a great stillness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he said to them, Why feared ye? how is it ye have no faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared with great fear, and said among themselves, Who is this, to whom the winds and the sea are obedient?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
