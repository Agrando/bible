There will not be left here a stone upon a stone which (will) not be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And while Jeshu sat on the Mount of Olives before the temple, Kipha and Jacub and Juchanon and Andreas asked him by themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell us when (these events) shall be, and what is the sign when these all draw nigh to be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But he, Jeshu, began to say to them, See that no man deceive you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For many will come in my name, and will say, I am (He); and many will be deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when you hear of battles and the rumour of wars, fear not: for it is that they are to be; but not yet is the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For people shall rise against people, and kingdom against kingdom; and earthquakes will he in various places; and there will be famines and convulsions. These are the beginning of sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But look (to) yourselves; for they will deliver you to the judgments; and in their assemblies will they scourge you, and before kings and governors you shall stand on account of their testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But first will be preached my gospel among all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they lead you to deliver you up, be not previously anxious what you shall say, nor premeditate; but that, whatever is given you in that hour, that say. For it is not you speaking, but the Spirit of Holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the brother will betray his brother to the death, and the father his son; and children will rise up against their fathers, and shall put them to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and you will be hated by all men on account of my name: but he who shall persevere to the end, he shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when you see the unclean sign of desolation, that which is spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (he who readeth, let him understand!) then let those who are in Jehud flee to the mountain</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he who is upon the roof, let him not descend nor enter in to carry any thing from his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and he who is in the field, let him not turn back to take up his garments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But woe to those who are with child, and to those who give suck, in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But pray that your flight may not be in the winter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for in those days shall be affliction such as hath not been from the beginning of the creation which Aloha created, and until now, nor shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And unless the Lord cut short those days, no flesh would live; but on account of the elect whom he hath chosen, those days he hath cut short.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then, if any man shall say to you, Behold, here is the Meshicha! and, Behold, (he is) there! believe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there will arise false Meshichas and prophets of a lie, and will give forth signs and wonders, to deceive, if possible, the elect also. But you, beware.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Behold, I have told you every thing before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in those days after that affliction the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give forth her light,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be moved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then will they see the Son of Man coming in the cloud with great power and with glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then will he send his angels, and will assemble his chosen ones from the four winds, from the extremity of the earth to the extremity of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But from the fig-tree learn a parable. When her branches are tender, and she shoots forth her leaves, you know that the summer draws nigh:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so also you, when you see that these things are done, understand that it is near, (even) at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Amen I tell you, That this race shall not pass until these all shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But of that day and of that hour man knoweth not, nor the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Look: be watchful and pray; for you know not when the time is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For as a man who hath journeyed, and left his house, and hath given authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and the door-keeper he hath instructed to be watchful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>(so) watch you, therefore, because you know not when cometh the Lord of the house,-in the evening, or in the dividing of the night, or at cock-crowing, or in the morning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>lest he should come suddenly, and find you sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But what to you I say, that unto all I say, Be watchful.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
