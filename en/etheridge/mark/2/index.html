And when they had heard that he was in the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>many were gathered together, so that it could not contain them, nor yet (the space) before the gate; and he spake with them the word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they came to him, and brought him a paralytic borne between four.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they could not approach him for the crowd, they ascended to the roof, and took the covering from the place where Jeshu was, and let down the couch on which the paralytic lay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Jeshu saw their faith, he said to the paralytic himself, My son, forgiven to thee are thy sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But some of the Sophree and Pharishee were there, who sat and reasoned in their heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Who is this uttering blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but One, Aloha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Jeshu knew in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, and said to them, Why reason you these things in your heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Forgiven are thy sins, or to say, Arise, lift up thy couch, and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But, that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he arose at once, and took up his couch, and went forth before them all; so that all wondered, and glorified Aloha, saying, Never saw we thus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>AND he went forth again to the sea; and the whole multitude came to him, and he taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he had passed, he saw Levi bar Chalphai sitting among the publicans: and he said to him, Come after me; and arising, he went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And while he reclined in the house, many publicans and sinners reclined with Jeshu and with his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the Sophree and Pharishee, when they saw him eat with publicans and with sinners, said to his disciples, Why with publicans and with sinners doth he eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when Jeshu heard, he said to them, The healthy have no need of the physician, but they who are sorely affected: I have not come to call the righteous but the sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the disciples of Juchanon and of the Pharishee fasted. And they came and said to him, (While) the disciples of Juchanon and of the Pharishee fast, why do not thy disciples fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jeshu said to them, Can the sons of the marriage-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? No;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken up from them: then shall they fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No man inserteth a new piece, and seweth it upon an old vestment; lest that new should take away its fulness from the old, and make the rent the greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; lest the wine rend the bottles, and the bottles perish, and the wine be spilled: but they put new vine into new bottles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>AND it was that, as Jeshu went among the grain, his disciples walked and plucked the ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharishee said to him, See how on the shabath they do what is not lawful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jeshu saith to them, Have you never read what David did, when he needed and was hungry, he, and they (who were) with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>how he entered the house of Aloha, when Abiathar was high priest, and did eat the bread of the table of the Lord, that which it is not lawful except for the priests to eat, and gave also to those who were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, that the shabath on account of the Son of man was made, and not the Son of man on account of the shabath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The Son of man, therefore, is the Lord also of the shabath.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
