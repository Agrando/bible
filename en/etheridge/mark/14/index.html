And they were angry with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he, Jeshu, said, Let her alone; why do you trouble her? A good work hath she wrought upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For in all time you have the poor with you, and, when you will, you can do them good; but I am not at all time with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(With) that which was hers she hath done this, and beforehand as for the funeral she hath anointed my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Amen I say to you, That wheresoever my gospel shall be preached in the whole world, this also which she hath now done shall be told in memorial of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Jihuda Scarjuta, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray Jeshu to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they when they had heard rejoiced, and promised silver to give him. And he sought to him opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the first day of the unleavened bread, in which the Jihudoyee sacrifice the Petscha, the disciples say to him, Where wilt thou that we go to prepare for thee to eat the Petscha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he sent two of his disciples, and said to them, Go to the city, and, observe, a man meeteth you bearing a vessel of waters. Go after him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and when he hath entered, say to the house-lord, Our Master saith, Where is the place of feasting, where I can eat with my disciples the Petscha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, behold, he showeth you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had told them: and they prepared the Petscha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when it was evening he came with his twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as they reclined and ate, Jeshu said to them, Amen I tell you, That one of you who eateth with me shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But they began to be sad, and said to him one, one, Is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said to them, One of the twelve who dippeth with me in the dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Son of man goeth, as it is written concerning him; but woe to that man by whom is betrayed the Son of man! It had been better for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they were eating, Jeshu took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them, and said to them, Take; this is my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took the cup, and praised and blessed, and gave to them; and they drank of it, all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, This is my blood of the new Covenant, which for many is shed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Amen I say to you, That again I will not drink from the fruit of the vine till that day in which I will drink it newly in the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they praised, and went forth to the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>AND Jeshu said to them, All of you will be offended with me in this night: for it is written, I will strike the Shepherd, and scattered shall be his sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when I have arisen, I go before you into Galila.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Kipha saith to him, If all shall be offended with thee, yet I (will) not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jeshu saith to him, Amen I tell thee, That thou, to-day, in this (very) night, before the cock shall crow, three times wilt deny me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he the more said, If I shall die with thee, I will not deny thee, my Lord. And so also all of the disciples said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they came to the place which is called Gedsimon; and he said to his disciples, Sit here until I have prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took with him Kipha and Jacub and Juchanon, and began to be sorrowful and agonized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said to them, My soul is afflicted unto death; wait for me here, and be watchful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he removed a little, and fell upon the earth, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said, Father, my Father, thou canst (do) every thing, cause to pass from me this cup: but not my will, but thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he came and found them sleeping: and he said to Kipha, Shemun, dost thou sleep? couldst thou not one hour watch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Be wakeful and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit is willing and ready, but the body is infirm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went again, prayed, and said that word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he turned again, came and found them sleeping, because their eyes were made heavy, and they knew not what to say to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he came three times (the third time), and said to them, Sleep on, and be at rest. The end approacheth, and the hour cometh, and, behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Arise, we will go; behold, he draweth nigh who betrayeth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And while he was speaking, Jihuda Scarjuta, one of the twelve, came, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the Sophree and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the traitor who betrayed had given to them a sign, and said, He whom I shall kiss is He: take him carefully and lead him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And immediately he approached, and said to him, Rabi, Rabi, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then they laid on him their hands and seized him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But one of those who stood drew a sword, and struck the servant of the high priest, and took off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jeshu answered and said to them, As against a robber are you come out against me, with swords and with staves to apprehend me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Every day with you was I teaching in the temple, and ye did not take me; but to fulfil the scriptures this is done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Then his disciples forsook him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But a certain youth followed him, and he was covered (with) a linen cloth, naked; and they laid hold on him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>but he left the linen cloth, and escaped naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they led Jeshu to Kaiapha, chief of the priests: and were gathered together to him all the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But Shemun from afar came after him, until within the court of the chief of the priests: and he sat with the servants, and warmed (himself) at the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But the chief priests and all the assembly of them sought against Jeshu testimony to put him to death, but they found not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For when many bore witness against him, their testimonies were not equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But men rose up against him, witnesses of falsehood, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>We heard him say, I dissolve this temple which is made with hands, and in three days I build another not made with hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>But neither so was their testimony equal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And the chief of the priests arose in the midst, and questioned Jeshu, and said, Returnest thou no answer? what witness against thee these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Jeshu was silent, and answered him nothing. And again the chief of the priests demanded, and said, Art thou the Meshicha, the Son of the Blessed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he, Jeshu, said to him, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the chief of the priests tore his robe, and said, Why now seek we witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Behold, from his own lips you have heard the blasphemy: how is it seen by you? And they all judged that he was guilty of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And some began to spit on his person, and they struck him on his face, and did buffet him, saying, Prophesy! and the servitors struck him upon his cheeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And Shemun being below in the court, there came a certain damsel of the chief of the priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>She saw him as he warmed (himself), and knew him, saying to him, Thou also wast with Jeshu Natsroia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied, and said, I know not what thou sayest. And he went without into the vestibule; and the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And again that damsel saw him, and she began to say to those who were standing, This man is also of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he again denied. And after a little while those who stood said to Kipha, Assuredly thou art from them, for thou art also a Galiloia, and thy speech is similar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>But he began to imprecate and to swear, I know not this man of whom thou speakest. And in the hour the cock crew the second time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And Shemun remembered the word that Jeshu had spoken to him, That before the cock should crow twice, three times thou shalt deny me. And he began to weep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
