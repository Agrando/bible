And Jeshu answered again, and said to them, My sons, how hard (is it) for those who trust on their riches to enter into the kingdom of Aloha!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the hole of a needle, than for a rich to enter into the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were the more astonished, and said among themselves, Who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Jeshu beheld them and said to them, With the sons of men this is not possible, but with Aloha: for every thing is possible with Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>THEN began Kipha to say, Behold, we have forsaken every thing, and have cleaved to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeshu responded and said, Amen I say to you, There is no man who forsaketh houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, on account of me, and on account of my gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive a hundred-fold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and fields, with persecution; and in the world which cometh the life that is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many (are) first who will be last, and last (who will be) first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now when they were going up in the way to Urishlem, Jeshu himself preceded them; and they were amazed, and came after him, fearing. And he took his twelve, and began to tell them what it was which was to happen to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, we go up to Urishlem; and the Son of man (will be) betrayed to the chief priests, and to the Sophree; and they shall condemn him to the death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and shall mock him, and scourge him, and spit in his face, and kill him: and the third day he shall arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>AND Jacub and Juchanon, sons of Zabdai, approached him, saying to him, Malphona, we would that whatever we ask thou wilt do for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He saith to them, What will you that I should do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They say to him, Give us that one may sit at thy right hand, and one at thy left, in thy glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he said to them, You know not what you ask: can you drink the cup that I drink? and (with) the baptism that I am baptized (with) can you be baptized?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They say to him, We can. Jeshu saith to them, The cup that I drink you shall drink; and (with) the baptism that I am baptized (with) you shall be baptized:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but that you sit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, except for those for whom it is prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard, they began to murmur against Jacub and Juchanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jeshu called them and said to them, You know that they who are considered the princes of the Gentiles are lords of them; and their great ones exercise power over them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but not thus shall it be among you. But if any one among you willeth to be great, let him be to you the servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and whoever of you willeth to be the first, he shall be the labourer for all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For even the Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life the ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they came unto Jirichu. And as Jeshu went forth from Jirichu, he and his disciples and a great multitude, Timai bar Timai, the blind man, was sitting by the side of the way begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he heard that it was Jeshu Natsroia; and he began to cry out, and to say, Son of David, have mercy on me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many rebuked him, that he should be silent: but he cried out the more, saying, Son of David, have mercy on me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Jeshu stood, and commanded that they should bring him. And they called the blind man, saying to him, Be of heart, rise, he calleth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But he, the blind, loosed his garment, and rose up, (and) came to Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Saith to him Jeshu, What wilt thou that I do for thee? And he, the blind, said to him, Rabi, that I may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jeshu said to him, SEE: thy faith hath saved thee. And instantly he saw, and he went in the way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
