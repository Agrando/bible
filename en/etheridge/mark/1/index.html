Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jeshu restrained him, and said, Close thy mouth, and come forth from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the impure spirit threw him down, and cried with a high voice, and went forth from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And all wondered, and questioned one with another, Who is this? and what is this new doctrine? because with authority he commandeth the impure spirits, and they obey him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And his fame soon went out through all the region of Galila.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he proceeded from the assembly, and came to the house of Shemun and Andreas with Jacub and Juchanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the mother-in-law of Shemun was lying in a fever; and they told him concerning her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he approached, took her by her hand; and she arose, and at once the fever left her, and she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then in the evening at sun-setting they brought to him all those who were grievously affected and demoniacs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the whole city was assembled at the gate:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and he healed multitudes who were grievously affected with various diseases, and cast out many demons, and would not permit the demons to speak; for they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>AND in the morning he arose long before (day), and went into a solitude, and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Shemun and (they) who (were) with him sought for him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and when they had found him, they said to him, All men are seeking thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said to them, Proceed you to the neighbouring towns and cities; for there also I will preach, because for this am I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he preached in all their assemblies in all Galila, and cast out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And a leper came to him, and fell at his feet, and besought him, and said to him, If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jeshu had compassion on him, and stretched forth his hand, touched him, and said, I will, be clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And in that very hour his leprosy went from him, and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he restrained him, and led him forth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and said to him, See lest thou tell any one; but go, show thyself to the priests, and offer the oblation for thy purification as Musha commanded for their testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he, when he was gone forth, began to announce it much, and so divulged the matter as that Jeshu could not go openly in the city, but was without in a solitary part: and they came to him from every place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
