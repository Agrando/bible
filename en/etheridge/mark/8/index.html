They say to him, Seven;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and he directed the multitudes to recline upon the ground, and he took those seven loaves, and blessed and brake and gave to his disciples that they should set, and they set before the assemblies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there were fishes, a few: and also over them he blessed, and said that they should set them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they all ate and were satisfied, and took up the abundancies of the fragments, seven panniers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the men who had eaten were about four thousand: and he dismissed them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and immediately ascended into a vessel with his disciples, and came to the region of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>AND there came forth Pharishee, and began to question with him, and they demanded of him the sign from heaven, tempting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he groaned in his spirit, and said, Why seeketh this generation the sign? Amen I say to you, There shall not be given the sign unto this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he left them, and ascended into the ship, and went to that overland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they had forgotten to take with them bread, and but one cake was with them in the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he counselled them, and said to them, Look and beware of the leaven of the Pharishee, and of the leaven of Herodes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they reasoned one with another, saying, Because we have no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jeshu knew, and said to them, Why reason you because you have no bread? do you not yet know nor under stand? is your heart still hard?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and eyes have you, and not see? and ears have you, and not hear? neither remember you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When those five loaves I brake to five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? They said to him, Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He saith to them. And when seven to four thousand, how many panniers of fragments when filled took you up? They say, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He saith to them, How do you not yet understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he came to Beth-tsaida; and they brought to him a blind man, and prayed of him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he took the hand of the blind man, and led him forth without from the village; and spat in his eyes, and laid (on them) his hand, and inquired whether he saw.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he looked, and said, I see the sons of man as the trees, walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Again he laid his hand upon his eyes, and he was restored, and he saw every thing clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he sent him to his house, and told him to go not into the village, nor to inform any man in the village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jeshu went forth and his disciples into the villages of Kesarea of Philipos, and he interrogated his disciples by the way, saying to them, What say men concerning me that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But they answered, That (thou art) Juchanon the Baptizer; and others, that (thou art) Elia; and others, one from the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeshu said to them, But you, what say you concerning me that I am? Shemun Kipha answered and said to him, Thus art the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha the Living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he charged them that to any one they should not tell concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he began to teach them, that it was to be that the Son of man should suffer much, and be rejected by the elders, and by the chief priests, and by the Sophree, and be killed, and that the third day he should arise!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he spake the word with them fully. And Kipha took him, and began to chide him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he turned, and, beholding his disciples, reprehended Shemun, and said, Get thee behind me, Satana, for thou thinkest not that which is of Aloha, but that which is of the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>AND Jeshu called to the assemblies with his disciples, and said to them, Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and come after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For every one who willeth to save his life shall lose it; and every one who shall lose his life on account of me and on account of my gospel, shall save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what is a man profited, if the whole world he gain, and his soul be lost?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Or what shall a son of man give (as) the compensation for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this generation, sinful and adulterous, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
