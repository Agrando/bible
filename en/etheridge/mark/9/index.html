And he was altered before their eyes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and his raiment shone, and became exceeding white as the snow; as the sons of man on earth could not make white.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And there were seen with them Musha and Elia discoursing with Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Kipha said to him, Rabi, it is good for us here to be: and let us make three tabernacles; for thee one, and for Musha one, and for Elia one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he knew not what he said, for they were in fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was the cloud, and it shadowed over them: and the voice was from the cloud, saying, This is my Son, the Beloved, him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And instantly, while the disciples looked, they saw no man, but Jeshu alone with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And while they were descending from the mountain, he charged them to tell no man what they had seen, until the Son of man should have arisen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they held discourse among themselves, and inquired what was this word, when he should have arisen from among the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they asked him, saying, How then say the Sophree that Elia must come before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He said to them, Elia doth come before, to restore all things; and how it is written concerning the Son of man, that much he should suffer, and be rejected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I tell you, Elia hath also come, and they have done to him whatever they would, as it is written concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>AND when he came to his disciples, he saw with them a great crowd, and the Sophree questioning with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And immediately all the crowd saw him, and wondered, and ran to salute him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he inquired of the Sophree, What dispute you with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And one from the company answered and said, Malphona, I had brought my son to thee, because he hath a spirit which speaketh not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and when he seizeth him, he dasheth him, and teareth and grindeth his teeth, and he becometh dry. And I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out, but they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jeshu answered, and said to him, O generation that believeth not! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I tolerate you? bring him to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him unto him: and when the spirit saw him, he immediately dashed him, and he fell upon the ground; and was convulsed, and was torn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jeshu asked the father, How long is it from the time from which it was thus? He saith to him, Behold, from his childhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And many times he casteth him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but whatever thou canst, help me, and have mercy upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jeshu saith to him, If thou canst believe, every thing can be to him who believeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in a moment the father of the youth cried out, weeping and saying, I am believing; help the defect of my faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when Jeshu saw the people running together, and assembling to him, he rebuked the unclean spirit, and said to him, Spirit, deaf and unspeaking! I command thee, come forth from him, and enter not into him again!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And that devil cried greatly, and crushed him, and went forth. And he became as the dead; as that many would say, He is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jeshu took him by the hand, and raised him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when Jeshu had gone into the house, his disciples inquired of him by themselves, Why could not we cast him out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeshu said to them, This kind with nothing can be cast out, but by fasting and prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when he had gone forth from thence, they passed into Galila: and he was not willing that any man should know of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he taught his disciples, and told them, That the Son of man would be delivered into the hands of men, and they would kill him; and that when he was slain, on the third day he should arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they understood not his word, and feared to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>AND they came to Kapher-nachum: and when they had entered the house, he asked them of what they had argued in the way among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they were silent: for they had contended in the way one with another, who should be greatest among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jeshu sat, and he called the twelve, and said to them, Whoever wills to be the first, shall be the last of all, and the servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took a certain child, and made him stand in the midst: and he took him upon his arms, and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Every one who receiveth (one who is) as this child in my name, me he receiveth: and whoever me receiveth, not me he receiveth, but Him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Juchanon said to him, Rabi, we saw a man casting out devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he did not adhere to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jeshu saith to them, Forbid him not; for no man who doeth powerful works in my name, can soon speak of me that which is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He therefore who is not against you is for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For every one who shall give you only a cup of waters to drink in the name that you are of the Meshicha, Amen I say to you, He shall not lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And every one who shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it had been better for him that an ass-millstone had been set to his neck, and he had been cast forth into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: better for thee mutilated to go into life, than having two hands to go into gihana;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: better for thee to go into life lame, than having two feet to fall into gihana:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if thine eye offend thee, root it out: better for thee that with one eye thou enter the kingdom of Aloha, than having two eyes to fall into the gihana of fire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For every (thing) with fire is salted, and every victim with salt shall be salted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Good is salt: but if the salt shall (become) insipid, how shall it be salted? Let there be in you salt, and in peace be one with another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
