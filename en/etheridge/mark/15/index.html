And he replied and said to him, Thou hast said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the chief priests accused him of many (things):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>but he, Pilatos, asked him again and said to him, Returnest thou not an answer? see how many are witnessing against thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But he, Jeshu, did not give any answer; so that Pilatos admired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he was accustomed at every festival to release to them of the bound one whom they requested;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and there was one who was called Bar-aba, who was bound with the makers of sedition, they who murder in the sedition had committed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the people cried out and began to demand, that as he was used he would do to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Pilatos answered and said, Will you that I release to you the King of the Jihudoyee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Pilatos knew that for envy the chief priests had delivered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests the more incited the multitude, that Bar-aba he should release to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he, Pilatos, said to them, What then will you that I do to this, whom ye call King of the Jihudoyee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they again cried, Crucify him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Pilatos said to them, Why? what evil hath he done? And they the more exceedingly cried, Crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Pilatos was willing to serve the will of the people, and released to them Bar-aba, and delivered up to them Jeshu, scourged, to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers led him into the court which is the praetorium, and called the whole band;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they robed him in purple, and twisted and set upon him a crown of thorns,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jihudoyee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and they struck him upon the head with a cane, and spat in his face, and kneeled upon their knees and worshipped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple, and clothed him with his own vestments, and led him forth to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>AND they constrained one who was passing, Shemun Kurinoia, who was coming from the field, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to bear his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they brought him to Gogultha, a place which is interpreted A skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they gave him to drink wine which was mixed with myrrh; but he would not receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, and cast for them lots who should take them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour when they crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And there was written the occasion of his death in the inscription, This is the King of the Jihudoyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they crucified with him two thieves, one on his right and one on his left;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and was accomplished the Scripture which said, That with the wicked he was reckoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>AND they also who passed by blasphemed against him, wagging their heads and saying, Ho, undoer of the temple and builder of it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>deliver thyself and come down from the cross!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And so also the chief priests laughing one with one, and the Sophree, and saying, Others he saved, himself he cannot save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Meshicha King of Isroel, let him descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe on him; and they also who were crucified with him reviled him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>AND when it was the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And in the ninth hour Jeshu cried with a high voice and said, Il, Il, Lamona Shabaktoni! Which is, Alohi! Alohi! why hast thou forsaken me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And certain who heard, of them who were standing, said, Elia he calleth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>but one ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and bound it on a rod that he might drink. And they said, Let alone, we will see if Elia cometh to take him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he, Jeshu, cried with a high voice, and completed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But when that centurion who stood near him saw that he cried thus, and ended, (he) said, Assuredly this man was the Son of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And there were women from afar who were beholding; Mariam Magdalitha, and Mariam mother of Jacub the less and of Josi, and Shaloom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>those who, when he was in Galila, adhered to him, and ministered to him, and many others who went up with him to Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>AND when it was evening of the preparation which is before the shabath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>came Jauseph, he who was from Rometha, an honourable counsellor, who also himself waited for the kingdom of Aloha. And he took courage, and went in to Pilatos and requested the body of Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But Pilatos wondered if he were now dead; and he called the centurion and asked him whether before the time he was dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and when he had learned, he gave the body to Jauseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Jauseph bought linen, and took him down and wrapped him in it, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn in the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But Mariam Magdalitha and Mariam, she who was (the mother) of Josi, beheld where he was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
