And they questioned him, saying, Is it lawful on the sabbath to heal? that they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, What man is there among you that hath one sheep, (who), if it fall into a pit on the sabbath-day, doth not take and lift it up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How much more precious is a child of man than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful on the sabbath-day to do that which is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand! and he stretched forth his hand, and it was restored like the other its fellow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the Pharishee went forth and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jeshu knew, and passed from thence; and great crowds went after him, and he healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he forbad that they should make him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That what was spoken by the prophet Eshaia might be fulfilled, who said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold my servant, in whom is my pleasure: My beloved, in whom my soul delighteth. My Spirit will I put upon him, And judgment to the peoples shall he preach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He shall not contend nor cry, And no man shall hear his voice in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A bruised reed he will not break, And a flickering lamp he will not extinguish, Until he bring forth judgment unto victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his name shall the gentiles hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>THEN they brought to him a certain demoniac who was dumb and blind; and he healed him, so that the dumb and blind could speak and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the multitude were amazed, and said, Is not this the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the Pharishee, when they heard, said, This (man) doth not cast forth demons unless by Beelzebub, the prince of the devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jeshu knew their reasonings, and said to them, Every kingdom that is divided against itself is destroyed; and every city which is divided against itself shall not stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then standeth his kingdom?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I by Beelzebub cast forth demons, your sons, by whom do they cast them forth? On this account they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I by the Spirit of Aloha cast forth demons, the kingdom of Aloha hath come nigh upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or, how can one enter the strong one's house, and spoil his goods, unless he first bind the strong one? and then can he spoil his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He who is not with me is against me; and he who gathereth not with me, in scattering scattereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Wherefore, this I say to you: That all sins and blasphemies shall be forgiven unto the sons of men; but the blasphemy which is against the Spirit shall not be forgiven to the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but every one who against the Spirit of Holiness shall speak, it shall not be forgiven to him, neither in this world nor in the world to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Or make the tree good, and the fruits (will be) good; or make the tree evil, and the fruits (will be) evil: for by the fruits the tree is known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Brood of vipers! how can you speak good who are evil? For from the abundancies of the heart the mouth speaketh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>A good man from the good treasuries bringeth forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasuries bringeth forth evil (things).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I tell you, that for every useless word which the sons of men shall speak, they must give the answer for it in the day of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>THEN answered certain from the scribes and Pharishee, and said to him, Teacher, we would wish to see a sign from thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But he answered them and said, A generation depraved and adulterous requireth a sign; but a sign shall not be given to it, but the sign of Jaunon the prophet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>for as Jaunon was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights, so the Son of man shall be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The men of NinevoÃ«. shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jaunon; and, behold, a greater than Jaunon (is) here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south shall arise in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the confines of the earth that she might hear the wisdom of Shelemun; but one more excellent than Shelemun is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>When the unclean spirit shall have gone forth from a child of man, he wandereth through places that have no waters in them, and seeketh repose, but findeth (it) not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then he saith, I will return unto the house from whence I came forth; and coming, he findeth it untenanted, cleansed, and decorated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he goeth and taketh with him seven other spirits, than himself more wicked, and they enter and dwell in him. And the end of that man is worse than his beginning. So shall it be with this wicked race!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he spake to the assembly, his mother and his brethren came, standing without, and seeking to speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And a man said to him, Thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, and are requesting to speak with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he answered and said to him who spake to him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold my mother, and behold my brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For every one who doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
