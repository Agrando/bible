Be done thy will, as in heaven, also in earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Give to us the bread of our need to-day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and forgive us our debts, as also we forgive our debtors;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory to the age of ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your Father who is in heaven will forgive you also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you will not forgive men, your Father also forgiveth not your trespasses unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>WHEN, too, you fast, be not morosely sad as the assumers of faces, for they defile their countenances so as that they may appear unto men to fast: and, Amen I say unto you, they receive their reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But thou, when thou art fasting, wash thy face and anoint thine head,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that it may not appear to men that thou art fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret, he shall reward thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Lay not up for yourselves treasures in the earth, a place where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves dig through and steal:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where no moth and no rust corrupt, and where thieves do not dig through and steal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For where your treasure is, there also your hearts are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The lamp of the body is the eye: if thine eye therefore be perfect, thy whole body will be illuminated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, what will thy darkness be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>No man can serve two lords; for the one he will hate, and the other he will love, or the one he will honour, and the other he will neglect: you cannot serve Aloha and riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>WHEREFORE I say unto you, Let not your souls be anxious what you shall eat and what you shall drink, and for your bodies what you shall wear. Is not the life more excellent than food, and the body than raiment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Behold the fowls of the heaven; they sow not, neither do they reap, nor collect into granaries; yet your Father who is in heaven nourisheth them: are you not far more considerable than they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But who among you by being anxious can add to his stature one cubit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and concerning raiment why are you anxious? Look upon the lilies of the wilderness how they increase; they toil not, neither do they spin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Yet I say to you, Not even Shelemun in all his glory was covered like one from among these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But if the herb of the field, which to-day exists, and tomorrow falleth into the oven, Aloha thus clotheth, how much more you, little of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Be not anxious, therefore, nor say, What shall we eat, or, What shall we drink, or, How shall we be covered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For after all these things do the people of the world inquire: but your Father who is in heaven knoweth that also by you are required these all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But seek first the kingdom of Aloha and his righteousness, and all these shall be added unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Be not therefore anxious for to-morrow; the morrow shall care for its own: the evil of to-day is enough for it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
