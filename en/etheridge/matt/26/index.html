But they settled to him thirty of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that time he sought to him opportunity to betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>BUT in the first day of the (Phatiree) unleavened-bread days, the disciples came to Jeshu, and said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he said to them, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, Our master saith, My time hath come! with thee will I perform the passover with my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jeshu had commanded, and prepared the passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when it was evening, he reclined with his twelve disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And while they were eating, he said, Amen I say unto you, that one from you betrayeth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were very sad, and began to say to him, one by one of them, My Lord, is it I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he answered and said, One who dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Son of man goeth as it is written concerning him; but woe to him, to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Better had it been for that man if he had not been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Jihuda the traitor answered and said, Am not I (he), Rabi? Jeshu replieth to him, Thou hast said!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But while they were eating, Jeshu took the bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to his disciples, and said, Take, eat, this (is) my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he took the cup, and offered thanks, and gave to them, and said, Take, drink of this all of you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>this (is) my blood of the new covenant, which for multitudes is shed for the remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I say to you, that I will not drink from henceforth of this product of the vines, until the day in which I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they sang praises, and went forth unto the mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>THEN said Jeshu unto them, You all shall be offended in me this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and scattered shall be the sheep of his flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after that I am risen I am before you in Galila.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Kipha answered and said to him, Though every man should be offended in thee, I never will be offended in thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jeshu saith to him, Amen I say to thee, that in this night, before the cock shall crow, three times thou wilt deny me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Kipha saith to him, If I am to die with thee, I will not deny thee. The same also all the disciples said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then cometh Jeshu with them unto the place which is called Gedsiman; and he said to his disciples, Sit here while I go and pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he took Kipha and the two sons of Zabdai; and he began to be sorrowful, and to be vehemently agonized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, My soul is afflicted unto death; wait for me here, and watch with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he removed a little, and fell upon his face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping; and he said to Kipha, How, could you not for one hour watch with me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Be watchful and pray, that you enter not into temptation. The spirit is ready, but the body is infirm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again he went the second time, and prayed, and said, My Father, if it be not possible for this cup to pass, unless I drink it, be done thy will!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he came again, and found them asleep; for their eyes had become heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he left them, and went again, and prayed the third time, and said the same word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he came to the disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and be at rest; lo, the hour cometh, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Arise, let us go: behold, he cometh who betrayeth me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he was speaking, behold, Jihuda the traitor, one from the twelve, came, and a great multitude with him, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jihuda the traitor had given to them a sign, and said, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And immediately he approached Jeshu, and said, Peace, my master! and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But he, Jeshu, said to him, (Is it) for that thou hast come, my companion? Then they came on, and laid their hands upon Jeshu, and took him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And, behold, one from those who were with Jeshu stretched forth his hand, and unsheathed a sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, and took off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then said Jeshu to him, Return thy sword to his place; for every one of them who take swords, by swords shall die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Or thinkest thou that I cannot request from my Father, and he shall appoint to me now more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>(But) how, then, would the scripture be accomplished, that thus it ought to be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>In that hour Jeshu said to the multitudes, As against a robber are you come out, with swords, and with clubs, to seize me? Every day with you in the temple I sat and taught, and you did not apprehend me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But this was done that what is written in the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all deserted him, and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And they who apprehended Jeshu led him unto Kaiapha, chief of the priests, where the jurists and elders were assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Shemun Kipha went after him from afar unto the court of the chief of the priests, and entered and sat within with the attendants, that he might see the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>But the chief priests, and the elders, and the whole assembly, sought against Jeshu witnesses, that they might put him to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>but they found not (any). And many witnesses of falsehood came. But, last, two came near,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>declaring, This said, I can destroy the temple of Aloha, and in three days rebuild it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the chief of the priests arose, and said to him, Dost thou return no word? What are these witnessing against thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jeshu was silent. And the chief of the priests answered and said to him, I swear thee, by Aloha the Living, that thou declare to us whether thou be the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jeshu saith to him, Thou hast said: but I say to you, That hereafter ye shall see him, the Son of man, sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the chief of the priests tore his robes, and said, Behold, he hath blasphemed! what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now we have heard his blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What will you? They answered saying, He deserves death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then did they spit in his face, and smote him; and others struck him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, Prophesy to us, Meshicha! Who is he that smiteth thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But Kipha was sitting without, in the hall, and a certain female domestic approached him, saying to him, Thou also wast with Jeshu Natsroia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied before all, and said, I know not what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he had gone out into the vestibule, another saw him, and said to them, This also was there with Jeshu Natsroia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied with oaths, I know not the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>But, after a little while, they who were standing drew near, and said to Kipha, Assuredly thou art of them; for thy speech also makes thee known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then began he to imprecate and to swear, I know not the man! And in that hour the cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Kipha remembered the word of Jeshu, who had said to him, That before the cock shall crow, three times wilt thou have denied me. And he went without, and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
