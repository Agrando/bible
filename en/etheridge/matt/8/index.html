I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to the other, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>When Jeshu heard this, he was moved with admiration, and said to those with him, Truly I say to you, that in Isroel I have not found faith like this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I tell you, That many shall come from the east, and from the west, and shall recline with Abraham, and Is'hok, and Jakub, in the kingdom of the heavens;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>but the children of the kingdom shall go forth into outer darknesses; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jeshu said unto the centurion, Go; as thou hast believed, it shall be to thee. And his child was healed in that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>AND Jeshu came to the house of Shemun, and saw his mother-in-law lying, a fever having seized her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he touched her with his hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and ministered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when it was evening, they brought before him many demoniacs, and he cast out their devils by a word; and all those who were heavily afflicted he healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Eshaia, who said, That he should take our griefs, and bear our infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now when Jeshu saw the great multitudes which encompassed him, he commanded that they should go to the opposite shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a certain scribe approached him, and said, Rabi, I will come after thee to the place whither thou goest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jeshu saith to him, The foxes have their dens, and the fowls of heaven a bower, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And another from his disciples said to him, My Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jeshu said to him Come after me, and leave the dead ones burying their dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>AND when Jeshu had ascended into the ship, his disciples ascended with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, behold, a great commotion was made on the sea, insomuch that the vessel was covered by the waves; but Jeshu himself was asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the disciples approached him, that they might awake him, saying to him, Our Lord, deliver us, we are perishing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Jeshu said to them, Why are you fearful, you little in faith? Then he arose, and forbade the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the men were struck with wonder, saying, What (being) is this, to whom the winds and the sea are obedient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when Jeshu came to the other side, to the region of the Godroyee, there met him two demoniacs, who came forth from the place of sepulchres, exceedingly malignant, insomuch that no man could pass by that way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shouted, saying, What to us, and to thee, Jeshu, son of Aloha? Hast thou come hither before the time, to torment us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now there was at a distance from them a herd of many swine feeding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Those demons, therefore, supplicated from him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jeshu saith to them, Go: and immediately they went forth, and entered into the swine; and the whole herd rushed directly over the rock, and, plunging into the sea, perished in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they who tended them, fled, and went into the city, and showed every thing that was done, and what concerned these demoniacs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the whole city came forth to meet Jeshu himself; and when they beheld him, they besought from him that he would remove from their coasts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
