AND when it was dark, he alone was there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the vessel was distant from the land many stadia, being greatly beaten with the waves, for the wind was against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But in the fourth watch of the night, Jeshu came to them, walking upon the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the disciples beheld him walking on the waters, and they were troubled, saying, That it was a spectre; and from fear they cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jeshu at once spoke to them, and said, Take courage, I am, fear not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Kipha answered, and said to him, My Lord, if it be thou, command me to come to thee upon the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeshu said to him, Come. And Kipha descended from the ship, and walked on the waters to go to Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when he saw the furious wind, he feared, and began to sink; and he lifted up his voice, and said, My Lord, deliver me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And immediately our Lord reached forth his hand, and seized him, and said to him, Little of faith, why art thou divided (in mind)?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they had ascended into the ship, the wind was tranquil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they who were in the ship, came and adored him, and said, Truly the Son thou art of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they rowed, and came to the land of Gen√©sar;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and the men of that country recognized him, and sent to all the villages that were about them, and they brought to him all those who were grievously afflicted,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and besought from him that they might touch only the border of his mantle; and those who touched were healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
