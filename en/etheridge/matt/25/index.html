go forth to his meeting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then all the virgins arose, and prepared their lamps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But those foolish ones said to the wise, Give to us from your oil; for, behold, our lamps are gone out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the wise ones answered them, saying, Lest it should not suffice for us and for you; but go to those who sell, and buy for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while they were gone to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were prepared entered with him into the house of festivity, and the gate was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>At last came also those other virgins, saying, Our Lord, our Lord, open to us!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But he answered and said to them, Assuredly I tell you, I know you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Be wakeful therefore, for you know not that day nor the hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>FOR as a man who journeyed called his servants, and delivered to them his property:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, each man according to his faculty; and forthwith went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he who had received five talents went and traded with them, and gained five others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Likewise he who (had received) two by trading gained two others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But he who had received one went, dug in the earth, and hid the money of his lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>After a long time the lord of those servants came, and received from them the account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he drew near who had received the five talents, and brought five others, and said, My lord, five talents thou gavest me: behold, five others I have gained by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His lord said to him, It is well, good and faithful servant; over a little thou hast been faithful, over much I will establish thee: enter into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he of the two talents approached, and said, My lord, two talents thou gavest me: behold, two others I have gained by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>His lord saith to him, It is well, servant good and faithful; over a little thou hast been faithful, over much will I establish thee: enter into the joy of thy lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he also drew near who had received the one talent, and said, My lord, I knew thee, that thou wast a hard man, reaping where thou hadst not sowed, and gathering together from whence thou hadst not dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And I feared, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: behold, thou hast thine own.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>His lord answered, Thou evil and slothful servant, thou didst know me that I reap where I have not sowed, and collect from whence I have not dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Did it not behove thee to cast my money upon the table, that when I came I might require mine own with its increase?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Take therefore from him the talent, and give it unto him who hath ten talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For unto him who hath shall be given, and it shall be added to him; but he who hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the indolent servant cast forth into the darknesses without; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>WHEN the Son of man cometh in his glory, and all his holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he shall cause the sheep to stand upon his right hand, and the goats on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom which was to be for you from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I thirsted, and you made me to drink; I was a stranger, and you received me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>I was naked, and you covered me; I was sick, and you cared for me; and I was in prison, and you came to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then shall say unto him those righteous, Our Lord! when did we see that thou wast hungry, and fed thee, or that thou didst thirst, and we gave thee drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and when did we see thee a stranger, and received thee, or naked, and covered thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and when did we see thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the King shall answer and say to them, Amen I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it unto one of these my least brethren, unto me you did it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then shall he say also unto them on his left hand, Go from me, accursed, into the fire of eternity, which was prepared for the accuser and for his angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For I was hungry and you gave me not to eat; and I thirsted, but you made me not to drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and I was a stranger, and you received me not; and naked, and you clothed me not; and I was sick, and in prison, and you visited me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then shall they also answer and say, Our Lord! when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then shall he answer and say to them, Amen I say unto you, that inasmuch as you did it not unto one of these little ones, you did it not to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And these shall go away into the torment which is eternal, and the just into the life which is eternal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
