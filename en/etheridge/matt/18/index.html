If, then, thine hand or thy foot shall be a cause of offence to thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee; for it is good for thee that thou enter into life lame or mutilated; and not that, having two hands or two feet, thou fall into the fire of eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if thine eye be a cause of offence to thee, dig it out, and cast it from thee; good (it is) for thee that with one eye thou enter into life; and not that, having two eyes, thou fall into the gih√¢na of fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>See that you contemn not one of these little ones: for I say unto you that their angels in all time are beholding the face of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the Son of man is come to save that which had perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>How doth it appear to you? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them shall wander from them, doth he not leave the ninety and nine on the mountain, and, going, seek that which had wandered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if he shall find it, assuredly I tell you that he rejoiceth in it more than (in) the ninety and nine which wandered not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So it is not good before your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>NOW if thy brother offend against thee, go, and argue (the matter) between thyself and him alone; and if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if he hear thee not, take with thee one or two, that upon the mouth of two or three witnesses may be established every word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if, also, he will not hear them, tell the church; but if he will neither hear the church, let him be to thee as a publican and as a heathen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And, Amen I say unto you, that whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again I say to you, that if two of you shall consent on earth concerning every thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For where two or three are assembled in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Kipha came near to him, and said to him, My Lord, how many times, if my brother offend me, shall I forgive him; until seven times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jeshu said to him, I say not to thee, Until seven, but, Until seventy times seven and seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>THEREFORE is the kingdom of the heavens likened to a royal person who would take the account from his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when he began to receive, they brought to him one who owed a myriad talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he had nothing to pay, his lord commanded that they should sell (both) himself, his wife, and his children, and all that he had, and to pay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And that servant fell and worshipped him, saying, My lord, be patient of spirit toward me, and all things I (will) pay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the lord of that servant had mercy, and absolved him, and forgave him his debt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then went forth that servant, and found one of his fellows who owed him a hundred pence; and he seized him, strangling, and saying to him, Give me what thou owest to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His fellow-servant fell at his feet, beseeching him, and saying, Be patient of spirit towards me, and I (will) pay thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he would not, but went and threw him into the house of the chained until he should have rendered him what he owed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When their fellow-servants saw what was done, they were greatly grieved, and went and declared to their lord all that was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then his lord summoned him and said to him, Evil servant! all that debt did I forgive thee, because thou didst entreat me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Oughtest thou not to have been as gracious to thy fellow-servant as I was gracious unto thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And his lord was indignant, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should have paid all whatsoever he owed to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Thus will your heavenly Father deal with you unless you forgive each his brother from your heart his trespasses.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
