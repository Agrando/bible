Behold, they who are softly clothed are in the house of kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if not, what went you forth to see? a prophet? I tell you, Yes; and more than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this is he concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send my angel before thy face, to prepare the way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Amen I say to you, there hath not arisen among them born of women who greater than Juchanon the Baptizer: yet, the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But from the days of Juchanon the Baptizer until now, the kingdom of the heavens by violence is taken, and the violent ones seize it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until Juchanon;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if you are willing, receive, that he is Elia who was to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whoever hath ears to hear, he shall hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>BUT to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children who sit in the public place, and cry to their companions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and say, We have sung to you, and you have not danced; we have wailed unto you, and you have not mourned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Juchanon came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, See a man a devourer, a wine-drinker, a friend of tribute-takers and of sinners. But justified is wisdom by her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then began Jeshu to reproach those cities in which were done many of his miracles, and which did not repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>saying, Woe to thee, Korazin! woe to thee, Bethtsaida! for if in Tsur and in Tsaidon those miracles had been done which have been performed in you, they would a while ago in sackcloth and ashes have repented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you, that for Tsur and Tsaidon it shall be more tolerable in the day of judgment than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And thou, Kaphernachum, who unto heaven art exalted, unto Shiul shalt be brought down; for if in Sadum had been done those miracles which have been done in thee, it would have stood until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I tell you that for the land of Sadum it shall be more tolerable in the day of judgment than for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>IN that time Jeshu answered and said, I praise thee, my Father, the Lord of the heavens and of the earth, that thou hast concealed these (things) from the wise and prudent, but hast revealed them unto little children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, my Father, for thus was it pleasing before thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things are delivered to me from my Father; and no man knoweth the Son but the Father; also the Father no man knoweth, except the Son, and he (to) whom the Son pleaseth to reveal (him).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come unto me, all you (who) are wearied and bearing burdens, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Bear my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am peaceful and lowly in my heart, and you shall find repose for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is kindly, and my burden is light.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
