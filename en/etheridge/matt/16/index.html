Hypocrites! the aspect of the heaven you are skilful to discriminate, (but) the signs of this time you know not how to distinguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>A depraved and adulterous race requireth a sign, but a sign shall not be given to it, save the sign of Jaunon the prophet; and he left them, and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when his disciples had come to the opposite, they had forgotten to take bread with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharishee and Zadukoyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But they thought within themselves, saying, (It is) because bread we have not taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Jeshu knew, and said to them, Why reason you within yourselves, little in faith, because bread you have not brought?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Have you not yet understood? Do you not remember those five loaves for the five thousand, and how many panniers you took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Or those seven loaves and the four thousand, and how many baskets you took up?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Why do you not understand that it was not concerning bread I spoke to you, but that you should beware of the leaven of the Pharishee and of the Zadukoyee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that he did not say that they should beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharishee and of the Zadukoyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>NOW when Jeshu had come to the place of Cesarea of Philipos, he questioned his disciples, saying, What do men say concerning me who am the Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They said to him, Some say that thou art Juchanon the Baptizer, but others Elia, and others Eramia, or one from the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He saith to them, But you, whom say you that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Shemun Kipha answered and said, Thou art the Meshicha, Son of Aloha the Living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jeshu responded and said to him, Blessed art thou, Shemun-bar-Jona; because flesh and blood have not revealed (this) to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Also I say unto thee, that thou art Kipha, and upon this rock will I build my church, and the gates of Sheul shall not prevail against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>To thee will I give the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he commanded his disciples that no man they should tell that he was the Meshicha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>AND from that time began Jeshu to show to his disciples that it was to be that he should go to Urishlem, and suffer much from the elders and the chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and the third day arise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Kipha took him (apart?) and began to expostulate with him, and said, Far be it from thee, my Lord, that this should be to thee!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he turned and said to Kipha, Get thee behind me, Satana! thou art a stumbling-block to me, because thou thinkest not from Aloha, but from the sons of men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then said Jeshu to his disciples. Whosoever willeth to come after me, let him deny himself, and let him take up his cross and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whosoever willeth to save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what shall a man be profited, if the whole world he shall acquire, and his soul shall perish? or what equivalent shall a man give for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is to be, that the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his holy angels, and then shall he render unto every man according to his works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>AMEN, I say unto you, There are men standing here who shall not taste death, until they shall have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
