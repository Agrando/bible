And they opened their treasures, and offered unto him oblations; gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And it was shown to them in a dream, that they should not return unto Herodes; so, by another way, they went unto their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>AND when they were gone, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream unto Jauseph, and said to him, Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee into Metsreen, and there be until I tell thee; for it will be that Herodes will seek the child, that he may destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Jauseph arose, took up the child and his mother, and fled by night into Metsreen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and was there until the death of Herodes. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Metsreen have I called my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herodes, when he saw that he had been deluded by the Magians, was greatly wroth, and sent (and) killed all the children of Beth-lechem, and all its limits, from two years and under, according to the time which he had inquired from the Magians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Eramio the prophet, who said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>A cry was heard in Rometha; weeping and great lamentation; Rochel weeping for her children, and not willing to be comforted, because they are not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>BUT when Herodes, the king, was dead, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Jauseph in Metsreen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and said to him, Arise, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Isroel; for they are dead who sought the life of the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jauseph arose, (and) took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Isroel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he heard that Arkelaos was the king in Jehud, instead of Herodes his father, he was afraid to go thither: and it was shown to him in a dream, that he should go into the region of Galila.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he came and dwelt in a city which is called Natsrath. So would be fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet, that a Nazarene he should be called.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
