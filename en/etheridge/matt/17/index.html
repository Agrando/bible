So also is the Son of man to suffer from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then understood the disciples that concerning Juchanon the Baptizer he spake to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>AND when they came to the multitude, a man approached him and kneeled upon his knees, and said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My Lord, have mercy on me! my son is lunatic and grievously afflicted; for often he falleth into the fire and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to thy disciples, but they could not heal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jeshu answered and said, O unbelieving and perverse generation! how long shall I be with you, how long shall I bear with you? Bring him hither to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jeshu rebuked him, and the demon went forth from him, and the youth was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then came the disciples to Jeshu by himself, and said to him, Why were we not able to heal him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Jeshu saith to them, Because of your unbelief; for assuredly I tell you, if there were in you faith as a grain of mustard, you should say to this mountain, Pass hence, and it would pass away; and nothing should overcome you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But this kind goeth not forth but by fasting and by prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>WHEN they had returned into Galila, Jeshu said to them, It is coming that the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they shall kill him; and in the third day he shall arise. And it grieved them exceedingly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they came to Kapher-nachum, they who took the two zuzis, the head-silver, approached Kipha and said to him, Your master, doth he not give his two zuzeen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He saith to them, Yes. And when Kipha entered the house, Jeshu anticipated him, and said to him, How doth it appear to thee, Shemun? the kings of the earth, from whom do they take custom and headsilver, from their children, or from aliens?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Shemun saith to him, From aliens: Jeshu saith to him, Then the children are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But that we may not offend them, go to the sea, and cast the hook; and the fish that first cometh up, open his mouth; and thou shalt find a stater, that take and present for me and thee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
