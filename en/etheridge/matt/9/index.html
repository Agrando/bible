But they pour new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>WHILE he spake these words with them, a certain chief came, drew near, worshipped him, and said, My daughter is now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jeshu arose, with his disciples, and went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And, behold, a woman whose blood had flowed twelve years, came behind him, and touched the edge of his vestment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For she was saying within herself, If I touch but his garment, I shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jeshu turned and seeth her, and said to her, Be comforted, my daughter, thy faith hath saved thee. And the woman was healed from that very hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jeshu came to the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the crowds which were making a tumult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, Retire; for the damsel is not dead, but asleep. And they laughed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he had put forth the crowds, he entered, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the rumour of this went forth through all that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>AND when Jeshu had passed thence, two blind men clave to him, and besought him, and said, Have compassion on us, Son of David!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he had come into the house, these blind men were brought to him. Jeshu saith to them, Believe you that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yes, our Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he touched their eyes, and said, As you believe be it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And immediately their eyes were opened. And Jeshu forbad them and said, Beware lest any man know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they went forth and spread the report of it through all that land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when Jeshu went forth, they brought to him a dumb person in whom was a demon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the demon had gone out, the dumb spake; and the multitudes were astonished, and said, Never was it thus seen in Isroel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharishee said, By the chief of the devils he casteth out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jeshu itinerated in all their cities and villages, and taught in their assemblies, and preached the gospel of the kingdom, and healed all diseases and all pains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>BUT when Jeshu saw the multitudes, he had compassion upon them, because they fainted and were dispersed as sheep that had no shepherd;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and said to his disciples, The harvest is great, and the labourers few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Ask, therefore, from the Lord of the harvest, that he would thrust forth labourers into his harvest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
