But he was silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then said the king unto the servitors, Bind his hands and his feet, and cast him forth into the darknesses without: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are the called, but few the chosen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>THEN went the Pharishee and took counsel how they might ensnare him in discourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent to him their disciples with (certain) of the household of Herodes, saying to him, Doctor, we know that thou art resolutely true, and (that) the way of Aloha in truth thou teachest; neither carriest thou fear for man, for thou acceptest not the person of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Tell us then, how doth it appear to thee? is it lawful to give head-money unto Cesar or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Jeshu knew their malice, and said, Why do you tempt me, you hypocrites?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me the denarius of the head-silver. And they presented to him a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jeshu said to them, Whose are this image and inscription?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They say, Cesar's. He saith to them, Give then (the things) of Cesar unto Cesar, and (the things) of Aloha unto Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when they heard, they wondered, and left him, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>IN that (same) day came the Zadukoyee, affirming to him, (that) there is no life for the dead. And they questioned him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying to him, Doctor, Musha has said to us that if a man die having no children, his brother shall take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But there were with us seven brethren: the eldest (of whom) took a wife, and died. And because he had no children, he left his wife unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So also did he who was second, and he who was the third, and unto the seventh of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the last of all the woman also is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In the resurrection, therefore, of whom from these seven shall she be the wife? for all had taken her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, You do err, because you understand not the scriptures nor the power of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection of the dead, they take not wives, neither are wives to husbands; but as the angels of Aloha in heaven are they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which has been spoken to you by Aloha, who said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Is'hok, the God of Jakub? But Aloha is not of those who are dead, but of those who are alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the multitudes heard, they were wonder-struck at his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>BUT when the Pharishee heard that he had silenced the Zadukoyee, they gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one from them, who was skilful in the law, questioned him, tempting him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Doctor, which commandment is greatest in the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jeshu said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy Aloha with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the commandment, the great and the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second is like unto it, That thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments hang the law and the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>while the Pharishee were gathered together, Jeshu questioned them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and said, What say you concerning the Meshicha,-whose son? They say to him, Son of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Saith he to them, And how doth David in spirit call him THE LORD? For he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>that the Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I put thine adversaries beneath thy feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If, then, David calleth him the Lord, how is he his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no man could give to him the answer; nor did any man dare again from that day to question him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
