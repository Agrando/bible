That, therefore, which Aloha hath conjoined, man shall not separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to him, Why then did Musha direct that he should give a writing of dismissal and send her away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, Musha, on account of the hardness of your heart, permitted you to send away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I say to you that whosoever shall forsake his wife who is not adulterous, and take another, committeth adultery; and whosoever taketh the deserted one, committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples say to him, If thus be the case between the man and the woman, it is not expedient to take a wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, Not every man is sufficient for this doctrine, but he to whom it is given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are some eunuchs who from their mother's womb are born so; and there are some eunuchs who by men are made eunuchs; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs on account of the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever is capable of receiving (this), let him receive (it).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then they brought to him children, that he should put his hand upon them and pray. And his disciples forbad them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jeshu himself said, Suffer children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of those who are as these, is the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he put his hand upon them, and went thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>AND one came and approached and said to him, Good teacher, what of good shall I do, that I may have the life of eternity?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he said to him, Why dost thou call me good? none is good but one, Aloha. But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to him, Which? Jeshu answered him, Thou shalt not kill, neither commit adultery, nor steal, neither shalt thou witness false testimony;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and honour thy father and thy mother, and love thy neighbour as thyself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man saith to him, These all have I kept from my childhood: how am I deficient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jeshu saith to him, If thou wilt become perfect, go, sell thy possession and give to the poor, and there shall be for thee a treasure in heaven: and come after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he, the young man, heard this word, and went away with sadness, for he had great property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Jeshu said to his disciples, Amen I say unto you, that it is difficult for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Again I say to you, that it is easier for a camel to enter through the aperture of a needle, than the rich to enter into the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the disciples when they heard were greatly hurt, saying, Who then can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeshu, beholding them, said, With the sons of men it is not possible; but with Aloha every thing is possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>THEN answered Kipha and said to him, Behold, we have abandoned every thing, and have come after thee: what then shall there be for us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jeshu saith to them, Amen I say to you, that you who have come after me, in the new world, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of his glory, you also shall sit upon twelve seats, and shall judge the twelve tribes of Isroel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And every man who hath relinquished houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, on account of my name, shall receive a hundred-fold, and shall inherit the life of eternity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Many however are first who shall be last, and the last first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
