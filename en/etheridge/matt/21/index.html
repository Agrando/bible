Ushana in the heights!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he had entered Urishlem, the whole city was commoved, and said, Who is this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the multitude answered, This is Jeshu, the prophet who is from Natsrath of Galila.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jeshu went into the temple of Aloha, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and said to them, It is written, that my house shall the house of prayer be called, but ye have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there came to him in the temple the blind and the lame, and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the chief priests and Pharishee saw the wondrous things which he did, and the children who were crying in the temple, and saying, Ushana to the son of David, they were displeased with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying to him, Hearest thou what these say? Jeshu saith to them, Yes: have ye not read, that from the mouth of children and of babes thou hast prepared praise?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>AND he abandoned them, and went forth without the city to Bethania, and lodged there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But in the early morn, as he returned to the city, he hungered:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and he saw a certain fig-tree in the way, and came to it, but found nothing thereon but leaves only; and he said, Let there be no fruit upon thee again for ever. And immediately that fig-tree withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the disciples saw, and were astonished, saying, How in a moment is the fig-tree withered!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, Amen I say to you, that if faith were in you, and you did not hesitate, you should not only do (as) to this fig-tree, but also were you to say to this mountain, Be thou lifted up and fall into the sea, it should be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatsoever you shall ask in prayer and shall believe, you shall obtain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Jeshu came to the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people approached him, while he taught, saying to him, By what authority doest thou these things, and who gave thee this authority?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, I will also ask you one word; and if you will tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these (things).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The baptism of Juchanon, whence is it, from heaven or from men? But they thought within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven, he saith to us, Why did ye not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if we shall say, From men, we fear from the crowd; for all have regarded Juchanon as a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they answered, saying to him, We know not: Jeshu saith to them, Also I tell not you by what authority I do these (things).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>BUT how doth appear to you? a certain man had two sons; and he came to the elder, and said to him, My son, go to-day work in the vinery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he answered and said, I am not willing: yet afterwards he relented, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He came to the other, and said likewise. He answered and said, I (will), my lord; yet went not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of these two did the will of his father? They say to him, The elder. Jeshu saith to them, Amen I tell you, the tribute-takers and harlots go before you into the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For Juchanon came to you in the way of righteousness; and you believed him not. But the tribute-takers and harlots believed him: but you neither when you saw (him, nor) afterwards, repented, that you might believe him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Hear another comparison: A certain man was a house-lord; and he planted a vinery, and surrounded it with an hedge, and dug a wine-press in it, and built in it a tower, and had it taken by labourers, and journeyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the time of fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might send him of the fruits of his vinery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the husband-men took his servants, and beat some, and stoned some, and killed others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And again he sent other servants more than the first, and they acted towards them likewise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>last, he sent to them his son, saying, Now will they be ashamed from my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take the inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they seized and cast him without the vinery, and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>When the lord of the vinery, therefore, cometh, what will he do to these husbandmen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They say to him, Most miserably will he destroy them, and the vinery will he cause to be held by other labourers, (even) such as will give him the fruits in their seasons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jeshu saith to them, Have you not read in the scripture, that the stone which the builders rejected, this is become the head of the corner? By the Lord was this done, and it is wondrous in our eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>On this account I tell you, that the kingdom of Aloha is taken from you, and shall be given to a people who will yield fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whosoever shall fall upon this stone shall be broken; but every one upon whom it shall fall, it will scatter (him).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when the chief priests and Pharishee heard his comparisons, they knew that concerning themselves he had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they sought to apprehend him, but feared the people, because as a prophet they regarded him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
