Thus you have abolished the word of Aloha for the sake of your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Ye hypocrites! rightly prophesied concerning you Eshaia the prophet, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This people with the lips honour me, but their heart (is) very far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But in vain they reverence me, while they teach the doctrines of the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he called to the multitudes, and said to them, Hear, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is not that which, entering the mouth, contaminates a man; but that which shall come from the mouth, that contaminates a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then drew near his disciples, saying to him, Knowest thou that the Pharishee who heard this word were offended?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered, and said to them, Every plantation which my Father who is in heaven hath not planted shall be rooted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Leave them: they are blind leaders of the blind; but if a blind man shall lead a blind man, both shall fall into the ditch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Shemun Kipha answered and said, My Lord, expound to us this parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said to them, Do you also not yet understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Know you not that whatsoever entereth the mouth, goeth into the belly, and from thence in purification it is cast without?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But whatsoever from the mouth shall come forth, from the heart cometh forth, and this contaminates a child of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For from the heart proceed evil thoughts, adultery, murder, fornication, robbery, false witness, blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are they which defile a man; but if any one eat when his hands are not washed, he is not defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>AND Jeshu went forth from thence, and came to the borders of Tsur and Tsaidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And, beheld, a Canaanite woman from those coasts came forth crying, and saying, Have mercy upon me, my Lord, son of David! my daughter is grievously possessed with the demon!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he did not return her an answer. And the disciples approached and requested from him, saying, Dismiss her, for she crieth after us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he answered and said to them, I am not sent but to the sheep which have wandered from the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then she came, worshipped him, and said, My Lord, help me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeshu said to her, It is not proper to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she said, Even so, my Lord; yet the dogs eat from the crumbs that fall from the tables of their masters, and live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then said Jeshu to her, O woman, great is thy faith! be it to thee as thou wilt! And healed was her daughter from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jeshu passed from thence, and came near the sea of Galila; and he ascended the mountain and sat there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And there drew near to him great gatherings (of people), and with them there were the lame, and the blind, and the dumb, and the mutilated, and many others; and they cast them at the feet of Jeshu, and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So that those multitudes were astounded as they beheld the dumb speaking, and the mutilated made whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the Aloha of Isroel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>BUT Jeshu himself called his disciples, and said to them, I have pity for this multitude, who, behold, for three days have continued with me, but there is nothing for them to eat; and to send them away fasting, I am unwilling, lest they should faint in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples say to him, Whence can we have bread in the wilderness, that we may satisfy this whole multitude?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jeshu saith to them, How many loaves have you? They say to him, Seven, and a few small fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he directed that the multitudes should recline upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took those seven loaves and the fishes, and offered praise, and brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they all did eat and were satisfied: and they took up of the abundance of fragments seven baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they who had eaten, were four thousand men, besides women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when he had dismissed the multitudes, he ascended into a ship, and came to the coasts of Magodu.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
