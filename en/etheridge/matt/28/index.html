Come, see the place in which our Lord was laid:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and go with speed, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the house of the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galila. There shall you see him. Lo, I have told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they went quickly from the sepulchre, with fear and with great joy, and ran that they might tell his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, behold, Jeshu met them, and said to them, Peace to you! And they approached, held him by the feet, and adored him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then said Jeshu to them, Fear not; but go tell my brethren, that I will go into Galila, and there they shall see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But while they went, there came certain from those guards into the city, and told the chief priests every thing that had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they assembled with the elders, and took counsel; and they gave money not a little to the guards,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>telling them, Say you that his disciples came (and) stole him away in the night, while we slept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this be heard before the governor, we will persuade him, and make you without care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they, when they had received the money, did as they had instructed them; and that saying went forth among the Jihudoyee until to-day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But the eleven disciples went into Galila, unto the mountain where Jeshu had appointed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but from them some had doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jeshu drew near, and discoursed with them, and said to them, There is given unto me all power in heaven and in earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As the Father sent me, so also I send you. Go therefore, disciple all nations, and baptize them in the name (of) the Father, and (of) the Son, and (of) the Spirit of Holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And, behold, I am with you all the days, until the consummation of the world. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
