Amen I say to you, There shall not be left here a stone upon a stone which shall not be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And while Jeshu sat upon the mount of Olives, his disciples drew near and said between themselves and him, Tell us when these things shall be; and what is the sign of thy coming and of the consummation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, Beware that no man cause you to err;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>for many will come in my name and will say, I am the Meshicha; and many will be deceived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But it will be for you to hear wars and the noise of battles; (yet) see that you be not perturbed; for all these will take place, but not yet is the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For people will rise against people, and kingdom against kingdom; and there shall be famines, and plagues, and earthquakes in various places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But these are all the beginning of sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then shall they deliver you to affliction, and shall kill you; and you shall be hated of all peoples on account of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then shall many be offended, and shall hate one another, and betray one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And many lying prophets shall stand up, and shall delude the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because of the abounding of iniquity, the love of many will languish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he who shall persevere unto the end,-he shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this annunciation of the kingdom shall be proclaimed in the whole world as a testimony for all nations; and then will come the end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when you see the unclean sign of desolation which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet, that it standeth in the holy place;-he who readeth let him understand!-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>then let those who are in Jehud escape to the mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And let not him who is on the roof descend to take what his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>nor he who is in the field turn back to take his vestment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But woe to those who are with child, and to those who give suck in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But pray that your flight may not be in the winter, nor on the shabath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For then shall be the great affliction, such as hath not been from the beginning of the world until now, neither shall be (again).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And unless those days be cut short, none could live of all flesh: but on account of the chosen those days shall be cut short.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then if any one shall say to you, Lo, here is the Meshicha, or there; believe them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For there shall arise false Meshichas and prophets of untruth; and they shall give forth magnificent signs, so as to seduce, if possible, the chosen also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>(observe! I have told you before,)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If therefore they shall say to you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: or, Behold, he is in the inner chamber; believe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen unto the west, so shall be the advent of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But where the body shall be, there will be assembled the eagles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But immediately after the affliction of those days, the sun will become dark, and the moon show not her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven be commoved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then shall be seen the standard of the Son of man in heaven, and then all the generations of the earth shall wail, and they shall see the Son of man coming upon the clouds of heaven, with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he shall send his angels with the great trumpet, and they shall gather the chosen who are his from the four winds and from the ends of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But from the fig-tree learn a parable: As soon as her branches are soft, and they put forth her leaves, you know that summer draweth nigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So also, when all these are seen, you know that it cometh to the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Amen I say to you, that this race shall not have passed away until all these shall take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heaven and earth shall pass away; but my words shall not pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>BUT concerning that day and concerning that hour, no man knoweth; neither the angels of heaven, but the Father only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But as the days of Nûch, so shall be the coming of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For as before the deluge they were eating and drinking, taking wives and giving to husbands, until the day that Nûch went into the ark;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and knew not till the deluge came, and carried them all away; so shalt be the advent of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then two shall be in the field; one shall be taken, and one be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two shall be grinding in the mill; one is taken, and one is left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Be wakeful therefore, because ye know not in what hour cometh your Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But this know; that if the master of the house knew in what watch the thief would come, he would have been watching, and not have suffered his house to be broken through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Wherefore be ye also prepared, because in the hour that ye expect not shall come the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>WHO is the servant faithful and wise whom his lord shall appoint over the children of his house, to give every one his meat in his time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed is that servant, who, when cometh his lord, shall be found doing so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Amen I say to you, that he will establish him over all that he hath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord withholdeth to come;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and shall begin to beat his fellow-servants, and shall be eating and drinking with drunkards;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the lord of that servant shall come in a day that he computeth not, and in an hour which he doth not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and shall sunder him, and set his lot with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
