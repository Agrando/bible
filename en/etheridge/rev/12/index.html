And the dragon stood before the woman when she was about to give birth, that when she had given birth he might devour her son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And she gave birth to a male child, who is to rule all nations with a rod of iron; and her son was rapt unto Aloha and unto his throne.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the woman fled into the desert, where she had a place prepared of Aloha, that there they might nourish her, DAYS A THOUSAND AND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was war in heaven. And Mikoel and his angels to fight with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels warred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they could not prevail, and their place was found no more in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the great dragon was cast down, the old serpent, who is called the Deceiver, and the Adversary, which seduceth the whole habitable world. And he was cast upon the earth, and his angels with him were cast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I heard a great voice in heaven saying, Now is there salvation and strength, And the kingdom of our God, And the power of his Meshiha; Because the accuser of our brethren is cast down, Who accused them before Aloha day and night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, And by the word of his testimony. But they loved not their lives unto death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Wherefore let the heavens be glad, And those who dwell in them. Woe to the earth and to the sea! Because the deceiver hath gone down to you, Having great indignation, Knowing that little time is to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the dragon saw that he was cast down upon the earth, he pursued the woman which gave birth to the son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the desert unto her place, where she was to be nourished A TIME, AND TIMES, AND THE DIVIDING OF A TIME, from the face of the serpent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the serpent cast forth from his mouth after the woman waters like a river, as that she might be carried off by the river which he would make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the earth succoured the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed the river which the dragon had cast forth from his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the dragon raged against the woman, and went to make war with those of the rest of her seed which kept the commandments of Aloha, and had the testimony of Jeshu.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
