But if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick from its place, if thou convert not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nikolitu, which also I (hate).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him who overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And to the angel of the church which is in Smurna, write: These saith the First and the Last, who was dead, and liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I know thy works, and affliction, and poverty, but thou art rich; and the blasphemy of them who say of themselves that they are Jihudoyee, and are not, but the synagogue of Satana.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Fear not any thing of those that thou art to suffer; for, behold, it will be that the accuser will cast some of you into prison, so that you may be tried; and you will have affliction ten days. Be faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who hath ears, let him hear what saith the Spirit to the churches. He who overcometh shall not be injured by the second death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And to the angel of the church which is in Pergamos, write: These saith he who hath the sharp sword with two edges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, where (is) the throne of Satana; and thou hast held my name, and not denied my faith in those days when my witness was exposed, my faithful one, who was killed with you where dwelleth Satana.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have against thee a little, because thou hast there those who hold the doctrine of Belam, who taught Balok to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat that which the sons of idols (eat), and to commit fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So hast thou who hold the doctrine of the Nikolitu: of it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>in like (manner), repent; and if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will war against them with the sword of my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who hath ears, let him hear what saith the Spirit to the churches. To him who overcometh will I give to eat of the manna which is hidden; and I will give to him the white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth but he who receiveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to the angel and church which is in Thiatiros, write: These saith the Son of Aloha, who hath his eyes as the flame of fire, and his feet like refined brass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I know thy works, and thy love and faith and service; and also thy patience, and thy last works to be greater than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have against thee that thou permittest thy wife Izabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat what the sons of idols (eat).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I gave her time when she might convert, and she willed not to repent of her fornication.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who have committed adultery with her into great affliction, if they repent not of their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And her sons will I kill with death, and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and the hearts: and I will give to you every one according to your works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to you I say, to those of the rest who are in Thiatiros, all them who have not this doctrine, the men who know not the depths Of Satana, as they speak; I will not throw upon you another burden;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but that which you have, hold, until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he who conquereth, and he who keepeth until the end my works, I will give to him power over the peoples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and as a vessel of the potter shall they be destroyed, as also I have received from my Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I will give to him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
