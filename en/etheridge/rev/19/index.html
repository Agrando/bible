Salvation, and power, and glory, and honour, Be unto our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>For true and righteous are his judgments; Because he hath judged the great harlot Who corrupted the earth with her fornication, And hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the second time they said, Halleluia! And her smoke went up for ever and ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the four-and-twenty presbyters fell, and the four living-ones, and worshipped Aloha who sitteth upon the throne, saying, Amen, Halleluia!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all his servants, And they who fear him, small and great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard as the voice of a great host, as the voice of many waters, as the voice of mighty thunders, saying, Halleluia, For the Lord our God the Omnipotent reigneth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let us rejoice and exult and give glory unto him; Because the marriage feast of the Lamb hath come, And his bride hath made herself ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it was given to her to be arrayed in fine linen, resplendent and pure; for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, Write, Blessed are they who to the supper of the marriage feast of the Lamb are called. And he said to me, These my words are the true sayings of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I fell before his feet to worship; and he said to me, See (that thou do it) not; thy fellowservant (am I), and of thy brethren who have the testimony of Jeshu. Aloha worship; for the testimony of Jeshu is the spirit of prophecy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw heaven opened. And behold a white horse, and he who sat upon him was called the Faithful and the True; and in righteousness he judgeth and maketh war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But his eyes were as the flame of fire, and upon his head were many diadems, having names written; and the name which was written of him no man knoweth but himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he was arrayed in a vestment sprinkled with blood, and his name was called The Word of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the armies of heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in garments of fine linen, pure (and) white.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from his mouth went forth a sharp sword of two edges, that therewith he might smite the nations. And he will rule the nations with a rod of iron, and he will tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath of Aloha the Omnipotent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he had upon his vestment and upon his thigh the name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I saw an angel standing in the sun. And he cried with a great voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, Come, gather to the great supper of Aloha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of chiefs of thousands, and the flesh of heroes, and the flesh of horses and them who sit upon them, and the flesh of all the sons of liberty and of the slaves, and of the small and of the great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I saw the beast of prey, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war with him who sat on the throne, and with his armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the beast of prey was taken, and the false prophet with him who wrought signs before him, with which he deluded them who received the signature of the beast of prey, and them who worshipped his image; and living they were both cast into the lake of fire which burneth with sulphur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rest were slain with the sword of him who sat upon the horse; with that (sword) which went forth from his mouth. And all the fowls were satiated with their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
