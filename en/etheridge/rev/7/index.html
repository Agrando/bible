And he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to hurt the earth and the sea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, neither the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I heard the number of them who were sealed, an hundred and forty and four thousands, sealed of every tribe of Israel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>of the tribe of Jihuda, twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Rubill, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>of the tribe of Ashir, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Naphtoli, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasha, twelve thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>of the tribe of Shemun, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Isokar, twelve thousand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>of the tribe of Zabolon, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Jauseph, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjomin, twelve thousand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After these I saw, and, behold, a great assembly, which to number no man was able, from all people and nations and tribes and tongues, were standing before the throne and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes, and with palms in their hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and, crying with a great voice, said, Salvation to our God! To him who sitteth on the throne, And to the Lamb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And all the angels stood around the throne, and the presbyters, and the four living-ones; and they fell before his throne upon their faces, and worshipped Aloha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, Amen. Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, And honour, and might, and power, To our God, for ever and ever.
