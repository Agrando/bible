AND I saw that a beast of prey ascended from the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon his horns seven diadems; and upon his heads names of blasphemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the beast of prey which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as (those) of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave to him his power, and his throne, and great authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And one of his heads was wounded as to death. And his stroke of death was healed; and all the earth wondered after the beast of prey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they worshipped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast of prey, (saying, Who is like the beast of prey,) and who is able to make war with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And there was given him a mouth speaking great sayings and blasphemies, and authority was given him to act, MONTHS, FORTY AND TWO.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he opened his mouth to blaspheme against Aloha, blaspheming his name, and his tabernacle, and those who dwell in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was given to him authority over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation; and there was given to him to make war with the saints, to overcome them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And all those who inhabit on the earth will worship him, they whose name is not written in the book of life of the Lamb from the foundation of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If a man have ears, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If any man into captivity leadeth, into captivity he shall go. If any man kill with the sword, it behoveth him by the sword to be killed. This is the patience and the faith of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw another beast of prey ascending from the earth; and he had two horns like those of the lamb, and he spake as the dragon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the authority of the first beast of prey he exercised before him; and he made the earth and those who inhabit therein to worship the first beast of prey, whose wound of death was healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he wrought great signs, as that also he would make fire to come down from heaven upon earth before men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he will seduce those who dwell upon earth to the making an image of the beast of prey who had the wound of the sword and lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it was given to him to give spirit to the image of the beast of prey, (that the image also of the beast of prey should speak,) and to cause that all those whosoever who worshipped not the image of the beast of prey should be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he caused all, small and great, and rich and poor, and sons of freedom and slaves, to have given to them a signature upon their right hands, or upon their foreheads;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>as that no man might be able to buy or sell, unless he had the signature of the name of the beast of prey, or the number of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Here is wisdom.
