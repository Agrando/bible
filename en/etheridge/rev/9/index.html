And I saw a star which fell from heaven unto the earth and there was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke ascended from the pit, as the smoke of a burning furnace; and the sun was darkened, and the air, from the smoke of the pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And from the smoke came forth locusts upon the earth. And there was given to them power such as scorpions have upon the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it was told them, that they should not hurt the herbage of the earth, nor any green (thing), nor any tree, but only those men who had not the seal of Aloha upon their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it was given them, that they should not kill them, but torture them five months. And their torture was as the torture of a scorpion when he striketh a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And in those days men shall seek death, and shall not find; and shall desire to die, and death will flee from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the likeness of those locusts (was this): they resemble the appearance of horses prepared for battle. And upon their heads (was) a crown of the likeness of gold; and their faces (were) as the faces of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as of lions;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and they had breast-plates as breast-plates of iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of the chariots of many horses running to battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they had tails like those of scorpions, and stings; and in their tails they have power to hurt men five months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they had a king over them, the angel of the abyss, and his name in Hebrew is Abadon; but in Javanith his name is Apolon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One woe hath gone. Behold, two woes yet come after it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Sixth angel sounded. And I heard one voice from the horns of the altar of gold which was before Aloha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels which are bound in the great river Phraat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the four angels were released, they who were prepared for an hour, and for a day, and for a month, and for a year, to kill the third (part) of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the number of the host of the horsemen was two myriads of myriads. I heard the number of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as I beheld those horses in the vision, and those who sat upon them, (I saw that) they had breast-plates of fire, and jacinth, and sulphur; and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions, and from their mouths went out fire, and smoke, and sulphur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And by these three plagues were the third of men killed; from the fire, and from the smoke, and from the sulphur which went out of their mouths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails: for their tails were like serpents which had heads, and with them they wound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the rest of men who were not killed by those plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons and idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their robberies.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
