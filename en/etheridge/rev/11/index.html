And if a man willeth to wound (them), thus must he be killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>These have power to shut heaven, that rain it may not rain in those days; and power have they over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague as many times as they will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they shall have completed their testimony, the beast of prey, which ascended from the abyss, will make war against them, and overcome them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and their dead bodies (will be) upon the wide street of the great city, which is called, spiritually, Sedum, and Metsreen, where also our Lord hath been crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And of the peoples and tribes and nations and tongues, seeing their dead bodies days three and a half, will not suffer them to be laid in the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they who dwell upon earth will rejoice over them and be gratified, and will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented them who dwell upon earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And after those three days and a half, the spirit of life from Aloha entered into them, and they arose upon their feet. And great fear fell upon them who saw them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they heard a great voice from heaven, saying to them, Ascend hither. And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their adversaries beheld them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And in that hour there was a great movement; and one of ten of the city fell; and there were killed in the movement the names of men seven thousand. And they who were left were made afraid, and gave glory to Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>That second woe hath passed. Behold, the third woe cometh quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Seventh angel sounded. And there were voices and thunders, saying, The kingdom of the world Is of our Lord, and of his Meshiha; And he will reign for ever and ever!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the twenty and four presbyters who were before the throne of Aloha, who were sitting upon their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying, We give thanks to thee, Lord God omnipotent, Who art, and who wast; Because thou hast taken thy great power, And hast reigned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the nations were angry; But thy wrath is come, And the time of the dead, That they should be avenged; And to give reward to thy servants, To the prophets, and to the saints, And to them who fear thy Name, To the small and to the great; And to destroy them who have destroyed the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the temple of Aloha was opened in heaven; and there was seen the ark of his covenant in his temple. And there were lightnings, and thunderings, and voices, and movement, and great hail.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
