And no man was able to learn the hymn, but the hundred and forty and four thousand (who were redeemed from the earth).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>These are they who with women have not been defiled, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever he goeth. These by Jeshu were redeemed from men, first-fruits unto Aloha and to the Lamb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And in their mouth falsehood was not found, for they are without spot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I saw another angel flying through heaven, who with blood had the everlasting gospel to preach to them who dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe, and tongue and people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>saying with a great voice, Serve Aloha, and give him glory: For the hour of his judgment cometh: And worship him who made heaven and earth, And the sea, and the fountains of waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And another angel, a second, followed him, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babel the Great, Which of the wine of the rage of her fornication Hath made all nations to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And another angel, a third, followed them saying with a great voice, If any man worship the beast of prey and his image, And receive his mark on his brow, or in his hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of Aloha, Which is mingled without sparing In the cup of his anger. And he shall be tormented in fire and sulphur, Before his holy angels and before the throne:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the smoke of their torment For ever and ever will ascend. And they have no rest day and night Who worship the beast of prey and his image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Here is the patience of the saints, Who keep the commandments of Aloha, And the faith of Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead Who in Aloha die from now. Yes, saith the Spirit, That they may rest from their labours, For their works follow with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud sat (one) like the Son of man, having on his head a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a great voice to him who sat upon the cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he thrust his sickle over the earth, and the earth was reaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, having also a sharp sickle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And another angel came forth from the altar who had authority over the fire, and he cried with a great cry to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and reap the clusters of the vintage of the earth; for the grapes of the earth are ripe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel thrust forth his sickle unto the earth, and reaped the vintage of the earth, and he cast into the winepress of the wrath of Aloha the Great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the winepress was trodden (without the city, and blood flowed from the winepress) unto the bridles of the horses, a thousand and six hundred stadia.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
