In the cup which she mingled mingle to her double.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>How much she hath pleased herself to be wanton, all this give her suffering and sorrow. For she said in her heart, I sit the queen, and am not a widow, and sorrow I see not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore in one day will come these her plagues, death and sorrow and hunger; and in fire she will burn, for mighty is the Lord God who judgeth her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the kings of the earth who with her have committed fornication, and have been wanton, shall weep and lament and wail over her, when they see the smoke of her burning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>standing from far, for fear of her torment, saying, Woe, woe, that great city Babel, that mighty city! For in one hour hath come thy judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the merchants of the earth shall be sorrowful over her, because no man buyeth of their burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No more (shall there be in thee) the burden of gold, and of silver and of precious stones, and of pearls; and of fine linen, and of purple, and of silk and scarlet; and of every aromatic wood, and every vessel of elephant's-tooth, and every vessel of wood of great price, and of brass and of iron and of marble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cinnamon and omomun and perfumes, and ointment and frankincense and wine and oil, and fine meal, and wheat, and cattle, and slaves, and horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the fruit of the desire of thy soul hath gone from thee, and all those things which are delicious and brilliant have perished from thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and the merchants of these things will find them no more. They who were made rich by her from afar will stand for fear of her torment, and wail and be sorrowful,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, Woe, woe, that great city, which was arrayed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and golded with gold, and (adorned) with precious stones and pearls;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for in one hour hath been destroyed wealth like this. And every captain and every pilot who navigateth to the place, and the mariners, and all who serve on the sea, stood from afar,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and cried, while beholding the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like to this great city!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they cast dust upon their heads, and cried, weeping and lamenting, and saying, Woe, woe, that great city, in which were made rich all they who have ships in the sea, from the preciousness of her! For in one hour she becometh desolate!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, heaven, and the angels and apostles and prophets, because Aloha hath judged your judgment upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And an angel took a stone, as a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with force is cast down Babel the great city, and to be found no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the voice of harpers, and of musicians, and of singers, and of trumpeters, shall be heard in thee no more.
