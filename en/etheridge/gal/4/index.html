In nothing have you injured me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you know that in infirmity of my flesh I preached to you at the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the temptation of my flesh you did not despise nor execrate; but as an angel of Aloha you received me, and as of Jeshu Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Where then is your happiness? For I testify of you, that had it been possible, your eye you would have plucked out and given to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Have I become your adversary, because I have preached to you the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They are emulous of you not for good; but they would shut you in, that you might be emulous of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is well to be emulous in good things at all time, and not only when I am with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My children, with whom I travail afresh until the Meshiha be formed in you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I would be with you now, and change the sound of my voice, because I am astonished at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you who are willing to be under the law, do you not hear the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one of the bondmaid, and one of the free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he who was of the bondmaid was born according to the flesh, and he who was of the free was by the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But these are parables of the two covenants: the one which was from Mount Sinai bringing forth into bondage, which is Hagar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>for Hagar is Mount Sinai which is in Arabia, and answers to this Urishlem, and serves in bondage, she and her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But she, Urishilem the high, is the free, who is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written, Be glad, O barren, who hast not borne; Exult and cry, thou who hast not travailed; Because multiplied are the sons of the desolate, More than the sons of the married wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But we, my brethren, as Ishak, are the children of promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as then he who was born of the flesh persecuted him who was after the Spirit, so also now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what saith the scripture?
