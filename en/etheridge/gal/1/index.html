Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am amazed how soon you have been turned from the Meshiha himself, who called you by his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>unto another gospel, which it is not; but there are men who disturb you, and (who) wish to remove you from the gospel of the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if we also, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you other than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As I have said before, and now again say to you, If any man preach to you other than what you have received, let him be accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For now do I persuade men, or Aloha? or do I seek to please men? For if until now I had pleased men, I should not have been the servant of the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But I make known to you, my brethren, that the gospel which is preached by me was not from man:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for neither from man had I received it and taught it, but by the revelation of Jeshu the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard of my former manners in Judaism, that I exceedingly persecuted the church of Aloha, and made it desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I excelled in Judaism more than many of the sons of my years who were of my kindred, and was exceedingly zealous for the doctrine of my fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, when He willed who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son in me, that I should preach among the nations, immediately I did not disclose to flesh and to blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>neither went I to Urishlem, to the apostles who were before me, but I went into Arabia, and again returned unto Darmsuk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And after three years I went unto Urishlem, that I might see Kipha, and I remained with him days fifteen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But others of the apostles I saw not, only Jakub, the brother of our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But these which I write to you, behold, before Aloha, that I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And after these I went to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Neither did the churches of Jihud which are in the Meshiha know me by face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this only they had heard, that he who had formerly persecuted us, behold, now preacheth he that faith which he beforetime had overthrown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in me they glorified Aloha.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
