For, behold, as if depicted before your eyes, hath Jeshu the Meshiha been crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>This only would I know from you: Through the works of the law received you the Spirit, or through the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Are you so foolish that having begun in the Spirit you are now finishing in the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And all these have you borne in vain? But would it be in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then, he who imparted to you the Spirit, and wrought miracles among you, (did he so) through the works of the law, or through the hearing of faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>As Abraham believed Aloha, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>know therefore that they who are of faith are the children of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For Aloha who knew before that he would justify the Gentiles through faith, evangelized before unto Abraham; as saith the holy scripture: In thee all the nations shall be blessed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>therefore believers are blessed with Abraham the believer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For they who are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who doeth not all that is written in this law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But that man is not justified by the law before Aloha, this maketh manifest: because it is written, The just by faith shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But the law is not of faith: but he who doeth those things that are written in it shall live by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But us hath the Meshiha bought from the curse of the law, and hath been made a curse instead of us: for it is written, Accursed is every one who is hanged on the wood:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>in order that upon the nations there might be the blessing of Abraham in Jeshu the Meshiha, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My brethren, I speak as among men: That a covenant of man because confirmed no one rejecteth, or changeth in any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to Abraham was promised the promise, and to his seed. And he did not say to him, Unto thy seeds, as of many; but, To thy seed, as of one, him, (namely,) who is the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But I say this, that the covenant which was confirmed before by Aloha, in the Meshiha, the law which was after, four hundred and thirty years, cannot nullify, nor (can it) abolish the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if the inheritance was by the law, it could not have been by the promise; but Aloha gave it unto Abraham by promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore then was the law? It was added on account of transgression, until the Seed should come, he, of whom was the promise; and the law was given by angels into the hand of a Mediator.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But a Mediator is not of one; but Aloha is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is the law therefore against the promise of Aloha? Impossible: for if a law had been given which could make to live, certainly righteousness would have been by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the scripture hath included all under sin, that the promise through faith of Jeshu Meshiha might be given to them who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But until (the dispensation of) faith came, the law kept us, as shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The law therefore was our conductor to the Meshiha, that we might be justified by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But faith being come, we are not under the conductor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For you are all the children of Aloha through the faith of Jeshu the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they who into the Meshiha are baptized have been clothed with the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jihudoya or Aramoya is not; the slave or the free is not; male or female is not; for you are all one in Jeshu Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if you are of the Meshiha, therefore are you the seed of Abraham, and heirs by the promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
