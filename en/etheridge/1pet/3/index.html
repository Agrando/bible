Let him keep his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak not guile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let him depart from evil and do good, And seek peace and run after it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears, to hear them; And the face of the Lord is against the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And who (is he) who will do you evil if you be emulous of good (actions)?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And (yet) if you suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. And you will not fear them who would make you afraid, nor be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But sanctify in your hearts the Lord Meshiha. AND be prepared to make defence to every one who shall seek of you speech concerning the hope of the faith, with meekness and with seriousness, while you have a good conscience;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that as they speak against you as against evil men, they may be made ashamed who have traduced your good conversations in the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it helpeth you (if) while doing goodly works you have to sustain evil, if so it be the will of Aloha, and not while working evils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because the Meshiha also once died on account of sins, the just on account of sinners, that he might bring us unto Aloha. And dead in the body and alive in the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>he preached unto those souls who were held in sheul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>those who before were disobedient in the days of Nuch; while the long-suffering of Aloha commanded that he should make the ark, upon the hope of their conversion, and eight souls only entered therein, and were saved in the waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>After which very type also you are saved in baptism, not while you cleanse the body from filth, but while you make confession of 6 Aloha with a pure conscience, and of the resurrection of Jeshu Meshiha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who is exalted unto heaven, and is at the right hand of Aloha, and unto whom are subject angels and authorities and powers.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
