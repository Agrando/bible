for not for themselves they inquired, but to us (and) of us they prophesied those (blessings) which now are revealed to you by them who have preached to you by the Spirit of Holiness which is sent from heaven; for into these themselves the angels also desire to look.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Wherefore gird up the loins of your minds, and be fully wakeful, and hope for the joy that cometh to you at the revelation of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>as obedient children, and not partaking again of the former desires which you desired when ignorant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But be holy in all your conversations, as he is holy who calleth you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because it is written, Be ye holy, as I also am holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if you call him Father before whom there is no respect of persons, and who judgeth every man according to his works, with fear conduct you in this time of your sojourn;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>while you know that not with silver which wasteth away, nor with gold, you have been redeemed from your vain works which you received from your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but with the precious blood of the Lamb spotless and unblemished, who is the Meshiha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who was afore-separated for this from before the foundations of the world, and hath been manifested in these last times for you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>who by him believe in Aloha, who raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and your hope may be in Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let your souls be sanctified in obedience to the truth, and be filled with the charity which respecteth not persons, that with a pure heart and perfect you may love one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>as men who are regenerated, not by a perishable seed, but by that which is imperishable, by the living word of Aloha which abideth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Because all flesh is grass, and all its beauty as the flower of the field. The grass withereth and the flower drieth up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but the word of our God abideth for ever; and this is that word which is preached unto you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
