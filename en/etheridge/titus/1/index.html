Grace and peace from Aloha the Father and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha our Saviour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this I left thee in Kreta, that those things which were wanting thou mayest rectify, and constitute presbyters in every city as I commanded thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Him who is without blame, and is the husband of one wife, and who hath believing children, who are not vicious nor addicted to intemperance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For a presbyter is bound to be without blame, as the steward of Aloha; he shall not be led by the will of self, nor be irascible, nor a transgressor over wine, neither shall his hand be hasty to strike, nor shall he be a lover of sordid gains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he shall be a lover of guests, and a lover of the good, and be chaste, and equitable, and holy, and withholding himself from lusts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and careful over the doctrine of the word of faith, that he may be able also to comfort by his teaching the healthy, and to reprove those who are contentious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For there are many who are not in subjection, and whose words are vain, and make the minds of men to err, especially those of the circumcision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>those, whose mouths it behoves to stop. Many houses they destroy, and teach what they ought not, for the sake of filthy gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>One of them, a prophet of their own, hath said, The sons of Kreta are always liars, evil beasts, and lazy bellies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And true is this testimony. Wherefore reprove them severely, that they may be sound in the faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>nor cast themselves to the fables of the Jihudoyee, and to the mandates of men who hate the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For every thing is pure to the pure; but to those who are polluted and unfaithful nothing is pure; but their understanding and their conscience are polluted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they profess to know Aloha, but in their works they deny him, and are abominable and disobedient, and reprobate to every good work.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
