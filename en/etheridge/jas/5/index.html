You have gathered fire for you for the last days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Lo, the hire of the labourers who have reaped your lands, which you have refused, clamoureth, and the cry of the harvests to the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth hath ascended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you have lived daintily on the earth, and have been wanton, and have nourished your bodies, as for the day of slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have condemned and have killed the just, and he hath not resisted you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>BUT you, my brethren, prolong your spirit until the coming of the Lord; as the husbandman who expecteth the precious fruits of his lands, and prolongeth his spirit for them, until he receive the rain the early and the latter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>so also you, prolong your spirit, and your hearts confirm; for the coming of our Lord draweth nigh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Groan not one against another, my brethren, that you be not judged; for, behold, the Judge standeth before the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The example of the prophets take to you, my brethren, to prolong your spirits in your afflictions, them who have spoken in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, behold, we give blessedness to them who have endured. You have heard of the patience of Iob, and the end which the Lord wrought for him you have seen; because that merciful is the Lord and compassionate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But before every thing, my brethren, swear not; by heaven nor by earth, nor with any other oath; but let your word be Yes, yes, and No, no, that you be not bound under condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if any of you be in affliction, let him pray; and if he rejoice, let him sing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if he be sick, let him call for the presbyters of the church, and they will pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the prayer of faith shall make whole him who was sick, and our Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. For great is the power of that prayer which the righteous prayeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Elia also was a man of suffering, as we; and he prayed that the rain should not fall upon the earth, and it fell not (for) three years and six months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And again he prayed, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth gave her fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>my brethren, if any of you shall err from the way of truth, and one shall convert him from his error,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>let him know, that he who turneth a sinner from the error of his way, saveth his soul from death, and hideth the multitude of his sins.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
