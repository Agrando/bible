For he who wavereth is like the waves of the sea which the wind disturbeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And let not that man expect to receive any thing from the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>who is divided in his mind, and disturbed in all his ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But let the humble brother glory in his exaltation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and the rich in his humility; for as the flower of an herb, so he passeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the sun ariseth in his heat, and drieth the herb, and the flower of it falleth, and the beauty of its appearance perisheth; so also the rich withereth in his reverses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Blessed the man who endureth temptations: for when he hath been proved he shall receive the crown of life, which Aloha hath promised unto them who love him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let no man say, when he is tempted, From Aloha I am tempted; for Aloha is not tempted with evils, and he no man tempteth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But each man from his concupiscence tempteth himself, and desireth, and is drawn away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this desire conceiveth and beareth sin; and sin, when it is perfected, beareth death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Do not err, my beloved brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>every good gift and perfect from above descendeth, from the Father of lights, with whom is no alteration, nor the shadow of vicissitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He willed, and begat us by the word of truth, that we might be the first-ones of his creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you, my beloved brethren, let every one of you be swift to hear, and slow to speak, and slow to be angry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for the wrath of man the righteousness of Aloha worketh not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Wherefore, remove from you all impurity and the abounding of wickedness, and with meekness receive the word which is engrafted in our nature, which is able to save your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>BUT be doers of the word, and not hearers only, neither deceive yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For if a man be a hearer of the word and not a doer of it, this (man) is like one who vieweth his face in a mirror;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for he seeth himself and passeth, and hath forgotten what (manner of person) he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But every one who looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he is not a hearer of the hearing of forgetfulness, but a doer of works; and this shall be blessed in his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if a man thinketh that he serveth Aloha, and holdeth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, of this man his service is vain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the service which is pure and true before Aloha the Father, is this, to visit the orphans and widows in their afflictions, and that a man keep himself from the world without blemish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
