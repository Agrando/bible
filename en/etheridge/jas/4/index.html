Is it not from the lusts which war in your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You desire, and have not; you kill and are emulous, yet it cometh not into your hands; you strive and make wars, and nothing have because you do not ask;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>you ask and receive not, because you ask wickedly, as that you may cherish your lusts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Adulterers, know you not that the friendship of this world is enmity with Aloha? He, therefore, who willeth to be the friend of this world, hath become the enemy of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you vainly think that the scripture saith, that In emulation desireth the Spirit who dwelleth in us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But more excellent grace hath our Lord given unto us. Wherefore he saith, Aloha humbleth the proud, and to the humble he giveth grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>BE subject, therefore, unto Aloha; withstand Satana, and he will flee from you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and draw nigh unto Aloha, and he will be nigh you. Purify your hands, sinners, and sanctify your hearts, divided of soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be humbled and sorrowful, and let your laughter be turned into grief, and your gladness into anxiety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Be humbled before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Speak not against one another, my brethren; for he who speaketh against his brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law. And if the law thou judgest, thou art not a doer of the law, but the judge of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For one is the appointer of the law and the Judge, who can save and destroy. But thou, who art thou, who judgest thy neighbour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But what shall we say of them who say, To-day or tomorrow we will go to this city, or that, and work there one year, and negotiate, and make gain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and they know not what shall be on the morrow: for what is our life, but a vapour which for a little while is seen, and vanisheth and endeth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For instead they should say, If the Lord will, and we live, we will do this or that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They glory in their pride. All glorying such as this is from the Evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he who knoweth the good and doeth it not, sin is to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
