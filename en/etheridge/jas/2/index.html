Behold, are not the rich uprisen against you? and do they not drag you to the house of judgment?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do they not blaspheme against that Good Name which is pronounced upon you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the law of Aloha in this you accomplish, as it is written, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, you do well;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but if you accept persons, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors against the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he who keepeth the whole law, and in one offendeth, of the whole LAW he is guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who hath said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, is he who hath said, Thou shalt not steal; but if thou do not commit adultery, yet steal, thou hast become a transgressor against the LAW.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So speak and so act, as those who by the law of liberty are to be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment is to be without mercy, upon him who hath not done mercy. Be you exalted by mercy over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>WHAT is the use, my brethren, if a man say, I have faith, and works he hath not? How can his faith save him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And, if a brother or sister be naked, and wanting the food of to-day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and any one of you shall say to them, Go in peace, be warm, and be satisfied, and give them not what is necessary for the body, what (would be) the use?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus also the faith that hath not works is dead, (being) alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For a man saith, Thou hast faith, and I have works; show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith from my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou believest that Aloha is one: thou doest well; the demons also believe and tremble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Art thou willing to know, O weak man, that faith without works is dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Our father Abraham, was he not by works justified, when he offered Ishok his son on the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thou seest that his faith was helpful unto his works; and by works his faith was perfected,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the scripture was accomplished which said, that Abraham believed in Aloha, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness, and the friend of Aloha he was called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thou seest that by works man is justified, and not by faith alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So also Rachab the harlot, was she not by works justified when she received the spies, and by another way sent them forth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Thus, as the body without the spirit is dead, so also the faith which is without works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
