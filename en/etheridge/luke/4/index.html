And he ate nothing in those days; and when they were fulfilled, afterwards he hungered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the accuser said to him, If thou art the Son of Aloha, tell this stone to become bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Jeshu answered and said to him, It is written, It is not by bread alone that the son of man liveth, but by every word of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Satana carried him up into a high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the earth in a little time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the accuser said to him, To thee will I give all this power and the glory of it, which to me is delivered; and to whomsoever that I will, I give it unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>If therefore thou wilt worship before me, thine shall be all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Jeshu answered and said to him, It is written, That the Lord thy Aloha thou shalt worship, and him only shalt thou serve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he caused him to be at Urishlem, and to stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If thou art the Son of Aloha, throw thyself from hence beneath:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for it is written, His angels he shall charge concerning thee to keep thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and upon their arms to bear thee up, that thou strike not thy foot against a stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Jeshu answered and said to him, It is spoken, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the accuser had accomplished all his temptations, he removed from him for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>AND Jeshu returned in the power of the Spirit into Galila, and there went forth a report concerning him in all the region about them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he taught in their assemblies, and was glorified of every one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he came to Natsrath where he had grown up; and he went out, as his custom was, into the synagogue on the day of shabath, and he stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And there was given to him the book of Eshaia the prophet, and Jeshu opened the book and found the place where it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, Because he hath anointed me to evangelize to the poor, And hath sent me to heal the contrite in heart, To proclaim to the captives release, And to the blind, vision, And to assure the contrite by remission,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And to proclaim the year of acceptance of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he rolled the book, and gave it to the minister, and went and sat down; but the eyes of all them in the synagogue beheld him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he began to say to them, Today is fulfilled this scripture which is in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And all witnessed him and wondered at the words of grace which proceeded from his mouth. And they said, Is not this the son of Jauseph?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jeshu said to them, You will perhaps say to me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself; and all that we have heard that you have done in Kapher-nachum do also here in your own city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he said, I tell you assuredly, There is no prophet who is received in his (own) city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I say to you the truth, that many widows were in the house of Isroel in the days of Elia the prophet, when the heavens were shut up for three years and six months, and great famine was in all the land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and to none of them was Elia sent, but to Sarephath of Tsaidon, unto a woman a widow:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and many lepers were in the house of Israel, in the days of Elisha the prophet, and not one of them was cleansed only Namon the Aramian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when they heard these things, they who were in the synagogue were all of them filled with anger,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and they arose, forced him without from the city, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built to throw him from the rock:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but he passed through them and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>AND he went down to Kapher-nachum, a city of Galila, and instructed them on the shabath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astonished at his doctrine, for with power was his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And there was in the synagogue a man who had the spirit of an unclean devil, and he cried with a high voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and said, Leave me, what to us and to thee, Jeshu Natsroia? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jeshu rebuked him, and said, Close thy mouth, and come forth from him. And the devil cast him down in the midst, and came forth from him, and hurt him not any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And wonder seized on every man, and they spake with each other and said, What thing is this? for with authority and with power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they go forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there went out the fame concerning him into all the region which surrounded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And when Jeshu had gone forth from the synagogue, he entered into the house of Shemun; and the mother-in-law of Shemun was afflicted with a great fever, and they besought him on behalf of her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and she rose up at once and ministered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But at the setting of the sun all they who had diseased ones, who were diseased with various diseases, brought them to him, and he upon every one of them laid his hand, and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he cast forth also devils from many, (they) crying out, and saying, Thou art the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha. And he rebuked them, and suffered them not to speak, for they knew that he was the Meshicha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And at the dawn of day he departed, and went to a desert place; and the people sought him, and came to him, and held him, that he should not go from them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>but Jeshu said to them, To other cities also must I go to announce the kingdom of Aloha, for concerning this I have been sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he preached in the synagogues of Galila.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
