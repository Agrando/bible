But he will answer and say, I tell you that I know not whence you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And you shall begin to say, Before thee we have eaten and drunk, and in our streets thou hast taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he shall say to you, I know you not whence you are: depart from me, workers of falsity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham and Ishok and Jakub and all the prophets in the kingdom of Aloha, but you be cast forth without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the south, and from the north, and shall recline in the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day came men from the Pharishee, saying to him, Remove, go from hence, because Herodes desireth to kill thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jeshu saith to them, Go, tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils and perform cures to-day and to-morrow, and the third day I am perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless it behoveth me to-day and to-morrow to work and the (day) after I shall go; because it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Urishlem, Urishlem! killing the prophets, and stoning them that are sent to her, what times would I have gathered thy sons as the hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and you willed not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Behold, left to you is your house a desert; for I say to you, that you will not see me until you shall say, Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
