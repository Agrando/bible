Come thy kingdom. Be done thy will as in the heavens also upon earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Give to us the bread of our need every day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and forgive us our sins, for we also forgive all who are indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he said to them, Who of you that has a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and shall say to him, My friend, lend me three loaves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>because a friend has come to me from the way, and I have nothing to set to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and that friend from within shall answer and say unto him, Disturb me not, for the door is shut, and my children are with me in bed: I cannot rise and give to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I tell you if for friendship's sake he will not give him, (yet) because of importunity he will arise and give him as many as he needeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I say also to you, Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For every one who asketh receiveth, and who seeketh findeth, and who knocketh hath it opened to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For what father (is there) among you who, if his son shall ask bread, will reach to him a stone? or should he ask a fish, how instead of a fish will he reach to him a serpent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>or if an egg he shall ask, will he a scorpion reach to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And if you, who are evil, know to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from the heavens give the Spirit of Holiness to those who ask him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>AND he was casting out a demon which was dumb; and when he had cast out the demon, the dumb spake, and the multitudes wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But some from them said, By Beelzebub, the prince of the devils, he casteth out devils;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>while others, tempting him, the sign from heaven demanded of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jeshu, who knew their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom which is divided against itself will be desolated; and a house that against its own self is divided falleth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and if Satana against himself be divided, how will his kingdom stand? Because you say that through Beelzebub I cast out devils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, your sons, by what do they cast (them) out? On account of this they shall be your judges.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if by the finger of Aloha I cast out devils, there hath drawn nigh upon you the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When the strong one armed keepeth his court, his possession is in peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but if a stronger than he shall come, he shall overcome him; all his armour he taketh on which he depended, and he divideth his spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who is not with me is against me; and he who does not collect with me, by scattering he scattereth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The unclean spirit, when he hath gone out from a son of man, goeth about through regions which have no waters in them, because he seeketh to him rest. And when he cannot find it he saith, I will return to my house from whence I went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he cometh he findeth it swept and ornamented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he goeth, taketh seven other spirits who are more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last of that man is worse than his first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>AND while he spake these words, a certain woman lifted up her voice from the crowd, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee, and the breasts which thou hast sucked!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He said to her, Blessed are they who hear the word of Aloha and keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when the assemblies had gathered together, he began to say, This evil generation requireth a sign; but no sign shall be given to it save the sign of Jaunon the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as was Jaunon a sign to the Ninvoyee, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them; for she came from the confines of the earth to hear the wisdom of Shelemun, and, lo, a greater than Shelemun is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jaunon, and, lo, a greater than Jaunon is here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>No man lighteth a lamp and setteth it in a secret (place) or under a measure, but upon a candlestick, that they who enter may see the light of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The lamp of thy body is thine eye; when therefore thine eye is simple, thy whole body also will be illuminated; but if it be evil, thy body also will be darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Beware, therefore, lest the light that is in thee become darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But if thy whole body be illuminated, and no part whatever in it be darkness, the whole will be light, as when a lamp with its flame enlighteneth thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>AND as he was speaking, a certain Pharisha requested of him to dine with him, and he went in to recline.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, the Pharisha, when he saw him, wondered that he had not first washed before his dinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jeshu said to him, Now you Pharishee cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but within you are full of rapine and wickedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Wanting in understanding! did not he who made that which is without, make also that which is within?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But of whatever there is, give in alms, and, behold, every thing is clean to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But woe to you, Pharishee! for you tithe mint, and rue, and every herb, and pass by judgment and the love of Aloha. These hath it behoved you to do, and those not to have omitted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Woe to you, Pharishee! for you love the chief seats in the assemblies, and the salutation in the public places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Woe to you, scribes and Pharishee, hypocrites! for you are like tombs that are not known, and men walk upon them, and do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And one of the Sophree answered and said to him, Doctor, while you say these things, you vilify us also!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But he said, Also unto you, Sophree, woe! because you lade men with heavy burdens, and you with one of your fingers will not touch those burdens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Woe to you! for you build the tombs of the prophets whom your fathers killed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>thus you bear witness that you consent in the deeds of your fathers; for they killed them, and you build their sepulchres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>ON this account also Wisdom saith, Behold, I will send to them prophets and apostles; and of them they will persecute and kill;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>that the blood of all the prophets which hath been shed from the creation of the world may be required from this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>From the blood of Habil unto the blood of Zakaria who was killed between the temple and the altar: yes, I tell you, It shall be required of this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Woe to you, Sophree; for you have taken away the key of knowledge; you enter not in (yourselves), and they who are entering you prohibit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And while he spoke these (words) to them, the Sophree and Pharishee began to be displeased, and they were wrathful, and controverted his words, and enticed him on many (points),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>seeking to lay hold on something from his mouth that they might be able to accuse him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
