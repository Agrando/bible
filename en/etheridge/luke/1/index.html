And she was filled with the Spirit of Holiness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and she cried with a loud voice, and said unto Mariam, Blessed art thou among women, And blessed is the fruit of thy womb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Whence unto me is this, That the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For, lo, as fell the voice of thy salutation on my ears, For great Joy leaped the infant in my womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And happy is she who hath believed, For there is a fulfilment of those things which have been spoken to her from the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mariam said: My soul doth magnify the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And my spirit rejoiceth in Aloha my Saviour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Who hath looked upon the lowliness of his handmaid: For, behold, from now all generations shall give blessedness to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Because he hath done for me great things, he who is mighty, And holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his grace is for ages and generations Upon those who fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He hath wrought victory with his arm; He hath scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He hath overturned the mighty from their thrones, And hath exalted the humble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>The hungry he hath satisfied with good things, And the rich he hath sent away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He hath helped Isroel his servant, And hath remembered his mercy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>As he spake with our fathers, With Abraham and with his seed for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mariam stayed with Elishaba three months, and returned to her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>BUT to Elishaba had come the time that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbours and the sons of her family heard that Aloha had magnified his grace upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it was the eighth day, and they came to circumcise the child; and they called him by the name of his father, Zakaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother answered and said to them, Not so; but he shall be called Juchanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said to her, No man in thy kindred is called by this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And they signed to his father (to show) how he willed they should call him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And he requested a tablet, and wrote, and said, Juchanan is his name. And every man wondered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And immediately his mouth and his tongue were opened, and he spake, and blessed Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And there was fear upon all around them; and in all the hill country of Jehud were these things spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all who heard reasoned in their hearts, and said, What is this child to be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And Zakaria his father was filled with the Spirit of Holiness, and he prophesied, and said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Blessed be the Lord, the Aloha of Israel; For he hath visited his people, and wrought for him redemption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And hath raised up for us the horn of redemption In the house of David his servant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, Who have been from of old,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>That we should be delivered from our adversaries, And from the hand of all who hate us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>To perform his grace with our fathers, And to remember his holy covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>The oath which he sware to Abraham our father,-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>That to us he would grant That, being delivered from the hand of our adversaries, Without fear we might serve before him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>All our days in righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And thou, child, the Prophet of the Most High Shalt thou be called; For thou shalt go before the face of the Lord, And thou shalt prepare his way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>To give the knowledge of salvation to his people In the forgiveness of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>Through the compassions of the grace of our Aloha; Whereby the morn-splendour shall visit us from on high,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>To illumine those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death. And to direct our feet into the way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child grew, and was strong in the spirit, and was in the desert till the day of his manifestation unto Isroel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
