And he willed to see him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when the apostles returned, they showed Jeshu all that they had done. And he took them by themselves to a desert place of Bethtsaida.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the multitudes, when they knew it, went after him, and he received them, and discoursed to them concerning the kingdom of Aloha. And those who had need of healing he healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>BUT when the day began to decline, the disciples drew near and said to him, Send away the multitudes, that they may go to the villages and hamlets that are around, to lodge in them and to find for themselves victuals, because we are in a desert place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jeshu said to them, Give you them to eat. But they said, We have nothing more than five loaves and two fishes, unless we go and buy food for all this people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for they were about five thousand men. Jeshu said to them, Make them recline in reclining companies, fifty men in a company.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the disciples did so. And they all reclined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Jeshu took those five loaves and two fishes, and looked up to heaven and blessed and brake and gave to his disciples, that they should set before the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And all did eat and were filled. And they took up fragments which abounded, twelve baskets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>AND as he was praying alone, and his disciples with him, he asked them and said, What say concerning me the multitude, that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They answered and say to him, Juchanon the Baptizer; and others that (thou art) Elia; but others that a prophet from the former prophets hath arisen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He saith to them, But what do you say that I am? Shemun answered and said, The Meshicha of Aloha!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he forbade them and cautioned them that this they should tell no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he told them how it was to be (that) he the Son of man should suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and Sophree, and (that) they would kill him; and that on the third day he would arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said before all, Whoever willeth to come after me, must deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and come after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For whoever willeth to save his life, loseth it; but whoever (is willing) to lose his life, for my sake, he saveth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For what is helped a son of man, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his soul, or perish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, the Son of man will be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>THE truth I say to you, that some who are standing here shall not taste death, until they have seen the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And it was after these words about eight days, that Jeshu took Shemun and Jakub and Juchanon, and went up into a mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And while he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was changed, and his garments became white and shone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And, behold, two men talked with him, who were Musha and Elia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>who appeared in glory; but they spake concerning his going forth which should be accomplished at Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Shemun, and they who were with him, had been heavy with sleep, and were scarcely awaked when they saw his glory and those two men who stood with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they began to depart from him, Shemun said to Jeshu, Rabi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; for thee one, and for Musha one, and for Elia one. But he knew not what he said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And as he spoke these (words) there was a cloud which shadowed over them, and they feared when they saw that Musha and Elia entered into the cloud.i</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the voice was from the cloud, saying, This is my Son, the Beloved, Him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when the voice had been, Jeshu was found alone. And they were silent, and told no man in those days what they had seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>AND the day after when they had descended from the mountain, a great multitude met them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And a certain man from the multitude cried and said, Malphona, I beseech thee, turn unto me; (there is) my son, my only one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and a spirit passeth upon him, and he suddenly crieth, and gnasheth his teeth, and lacerateth, and hardly removeth from him when he hath bruised him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, but they could not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then Jeshu answered and said, Ah generation unbelieving and perverse! how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring thy son hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as they brought him near, the devil cast him down and bruised him: and Jeshu rebuked that unclean spirit and healed the youth and gave him to his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they all wondered at the majesty of Aloha. And while every one wondered at all which Jeshu did, he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Treasure these words in your ears; for the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But they understood not that saying, because it was hidden from them that they should not know it: and they feared to ask of him concerning that saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And there entered among them the thought, Who should be greatest among them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But Jeshu knew the thought of their heart; and he took a child and made him stand with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to them, Every one who receiveth a child like this in my name, receiveth me. And whosoever receiveth me, he receiveth Him who sent me. For he who is least among you, he shall be greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And Juchanon answered and said, Raban, we saw a man who was casting out demons in thy name, and we forbade him, because he came not with us after thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jeshu saith to them, Forbid him not; for he who is not against us, he is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>AND it was that when the days were fulfilled for his Assumption, he directed his face to go to Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he sent messengers before his face, and they went and entered into a village of the Shomroyee, so as to prepare for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they would not receive him, because his face unto Urishlem was set to go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when Jacub and Juchanon his disciples saw it, they say to him, Maran, art thou willing that we call fire to descend from heaven to consume them, as Elia did?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he turned and reproved them, and said, You know not of what spirit you are: for the Son of man is not come to destroy lives, but to save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And they went to another village.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And while they went in the way, a certain man said to him, I will follow thee to the place whither thou goest, my Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jeshu saith to him, The foxes have holes and the fowls of the heaven a shadow, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And he said to another, Come after me. But he said to him, My Lord, permit me first to go bury my father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Jeshu said to him, Leave the dead burying their dead; and thou, go and preach the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And another said to him, I will come after thee, my Lord, but first permit me to go to salute the sons of my house, and I will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jeshu saith to him, No man putting his hand upon the coulter of the yoke, and looking behind him, is fit for the kingdom of Aloha.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
