But when he was not greatly distant from the house, the centurion sent to him his friends, saying to him, My Lord, labour not, for I am not worthy that thou shouldst enter beneath my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wherefore I was not worthy to come to thee; but speak by a word, and my youth shall be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I also am a man who am subjected under authority; and there are under my hand soldiers, and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when Jeshu heard these (words), he admired, and turned and said to the company who came after him, I tell you, that not also in the house of Isroel have I found faith like this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they who had been sent, returned to the house, and found the servant who had been sick now well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>AND it was the day after, that he went to a city whose name was Nain, and his disciples with him, and a great multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he approached the gate of the city, he saw (them) following (one) dead, who was the only born of his mother, and she his mother was a widow: and a great multitude of the people of the city were with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jeshu beheld her, and had compassion upon her, and said to her, Weep not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he went and touched the bier; and they who were carrying it stood. And he said, Young man, to thee I say, Arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fear seized all men; and they glorified Aloha, saying, A great prophet hath arisen among us, and Aloha hath visited his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this word concerning him went forth into all Jihud, and into the whole region around them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of Juchanon showed him all these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>AND Juchanon called two from his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and sent them to Jeshu, saying, Art thou He who cometh! or another should we expect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But in that very hour he healed many from diseases, and from plagues, and from evil spirits; and to many blind he gave to see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jeshu answered and said to them, Go tell Juchanon every thing you have seen and heard: that the blind see, and the lame walk, and the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead arise, and the poor are evangelized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and blessed is he whosoever is not offended in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the disciples of Juchanon were gone, Jeshu began to speak to the people concerning Juchanon: What went you forth into the wilderness to see? a reed from the wind shaken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If not, what went you forth to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they who are clothed in bright vestments, and are (living) in pleasures, are in the house of kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If not, what went you forth to see? a prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>he, concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send mine angel before thy face, Who shall prepare the way before thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I tell you, that no prophet among those born of women (hath been) greater than Juchanon the Baptizer. Yet the least in the kingdom of Aloha is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(And all the people that heard him, and the tribute-gatherers also, justified Aloha, because they were baptized with the baptism of Juchanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But the Pharishee and Sophree rejected against themselves the will of Aloha, because they were not baptized of him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>With what therefore shall I compare the men of this generation, and to what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in the public place, and crying to their companions, and saying, We have sung to you, and you have not danced; we have wailed to you, and you have not wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For Juchanon the Baptizer came, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, A devil is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of man came eating and drinking, and you say, Behold a man a devourer and a drinker of wine, and a friend of tribute-takers and of sinners!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But justified is wisdom of her sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>NOW there came one of the Pharishee requesting of him to eat with him: and he entered into the house of the Pharisha, and reclined.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And a woman, a sinner, was in that city; and when she knew that in the house of the Pharisha he reclined, she took a vase of ointment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and stood behind him at his feet and wept, and began with her tears to bedrop his feet, and with the hair of her head to wipe them, and she kissed his feet, and anointed (them) with the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But when the Pharisha who had invited him saw (this), he thought within himself and said, Were this a prophet, he would know who this is and what is her report, for this woman is a sinner who toucheth him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Jeshu answered and said to him, Shemun, I have somewhat to say to thee. He said to him, Say, Rabi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jeshu said to him, A certain creditor had two debtors: the one owed him five hundred dinoree, and the other fifty dinoree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when they had nothing to pay, he forgave them both. Which, therefore, of them the most would love him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Shemun answered and said, I think he to whom much was forgiven. Jeshu said to him, Thou hast judged rightly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he turned to that woman, and said to Shemun, Thou seest this woman: I entered thy house; waters for my feet thou gavest me not; but this with her tears hath bedropped my feet, and with her hair hath wiped them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thou didst not kiss me; but, behold, this from (the time) I entered hath not ceased my feet to kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Thou with ointment my feet didst not anoint, but this with ointment of balsam my feet hath anointed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Therefore I tell thee, That forgiven to her are her many sins, because she hath loved much. For he to whom little is forgiven, little loveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, Woman, forgiven to thee (are) thy sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But they who reclined said among themselves, Who is this who also sins forgiveth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jeshu said to that woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
