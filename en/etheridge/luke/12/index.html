Fear not, therefore; than many sparrows more precious are you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But I tell you that every one who shall confess me before men, the Son of man will also confess him before the angels of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But he who denieth me before men, I will deny him before the angels of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And every one who shall speak a word against the Son of man, it may be forgiven him; but whoever against the Spirit of Holiness shall blaspheme, it shall not be forgiven him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they bring you into the synagogues, before heads and authorities, be not anxious how you shall express yourselves, or what you shall say;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the Spirit of Holiness will teach you in that hour what you ought to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>AND a man from the assembly said to him, Malphona, tell my brother to divide with me the inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jeshu said to him, Man, who established me over you a judge and a divider?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to his disciples, Beware of all avarice: for life is not in the abundance of riches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he spake a parable to them: The ground of a certain rich man produced him much provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he thought within himself, and said, What shall I do? for I have not where to collect my provisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, This will I do: I will destroy my house of stores, and will build and enlarge it; and there will I collect all my provender and my good things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and I will say to my soul, My soul, thou hast many good things laid up for many years: be at ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Aloha said to him, Reasonless (man)! this night thy soul they shall require of thee; and then, (the things) which thou hast prepared,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whose shall they be? So is he who layeth up to himself treasures, and towards Aloha is not rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to his disciples, Therefore I tell you, Be not anxious for yourselves, what you shall eat; neither for the body, how you shall dress:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for the soul is more precious than food, and the body than raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens, which sow not nor reap, which have no chambers or barns, yet Aloha feeds them. How much, therefore, are you better than the fowls!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you by being anxious could add to his stature one cubit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if indeed you are not capable of (that which is) the least, why concerning the rest are you anxious?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies, how they grow, which toil not nor spin; but I tell you that even Shelemun in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if the herbage, which today is in the field, and to-morrow is cast into the furnace, Aloha thus clothes, how much more you, little in faith!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And seek you not what you shall eat, and what you shall drink; nor let your mind be distracted for these:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>for all these the nations of the world seek; but to you also your Father knoweth that these are needful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But seek the kingdom of Aloha, and these all shall be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>FEAR not, little flock; for your Father hath willed to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell your substance, and give alms: make to you bags which become not old, and a treasure which is not transient, in the heavens, where the thief does not approach, and the moth destroys not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there will be also your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Let your loins be bound, and your lamps be burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and be you like men who wait for their lord, when he shall return from the place of festivity, that, when he hath come and knocked, immediately they may open to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed those servants who, when their lord shall come, shall be found watching. Amen I tell you, He will gird his loins, and make them recline, and will come over and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And if in the second or the third watch he shall come and find them thus, blessed will be those servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But this know, that if the lord of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have permitted his house to be dug through.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Also you, be you therefore ready: for, in that hour that you think not, cometh the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Shemun Kipha said to him, Our Lord, to us speakest thou this parable, or to all men also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jeshu said to him, Who then is that steward, faithful and wise, whom his lord hath established over his service, to give the portion in its time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed that servant whom, when his lord shall come, he shall find so doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Assuredly I tell you, He will establish him over all his substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if that servant shall say in his heart, My lord withholdeth to come, and shall begin to beat the servants and the handmaids of his lord, and shall begin to eat and to drink and be drunken;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the lord of that servant will come in a day when he thinketh not, and in an hour which he knoweth not; and shall sunder him, and set him his portion with those who are not faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that servant who knew the will of his lord, and prepared not himself according to his will, shall be beaten with many</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he who knew not, and did that which was worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For every one to whom much is given, much will be required from him; and to whom much is committed, the more will they require at his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>FIRE have I come to send forth upon the earth, and I would that it already burned:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and I have a baptism (wherewith) to be baptized, and greatly am I pressed till it be completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Suppose you that peace I have come to send forth on the earth? I tell you, not (peace), but divisions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For from henceforth there will be five in one house, who (will be) divided, three against two, and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For the father will be divided against his son, and the son against his father; the mother against her daughter, and the daughter against her mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law and the daughter-in-law against the mother-in-law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he said to the assembly, When you see a cloud arisen from the west, immediately you say, The rain cometh; and it is so:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>and when bloweth the south, you say, It becomes heat; and it is so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>You hypocrites, the aspect of the sky and of the earth you know to distinguish; but this Time how do you not distinguish?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But why of yourselves judge you not the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>When thou art going with thine adversary to the magistrate, while in the way, negotiate, and be freed from him; lest he bring thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the exactor, and the exactor cast thee into the house of the bound;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>and Amen I tell thee, Thou wilt not be delivered from thence till thou shalt have given the last shomona.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
