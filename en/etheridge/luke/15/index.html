And he divided to them his substance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after a few days the minor son gathered together his all whatsoever, and went into a distant country, and there dispersed his substance in living profusely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when every thing he had was finished, there was a great famine in that country; and he began to want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he went and joined himself to one of the sons of the city of that place; and he sent him into the field to tend the swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he had a desire to fill his belly with those karubs which the swine did eat; and no man gave to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when he came to himself, he said, How many hirelings are there now in my father's house, who have abundance of bread, and I here with hunger am perishing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will arise, go to my father, and say to him, My father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and am no more worthy thy son to be called: make me as one of thy hirelings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he arose, (and) went to his father. And while he was (yet) afar, his father saw him, and had compassion upon him, and ran, fell upon his neck, and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his son said to him, My father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee, and am not worthy thy son to be called.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his father said to his servants, Bring forth the first robe to clothe him, and put a ring upon his hand, and let him be, shod with sandals,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and bring, kill the calf that is fat, and let us eat and be glad;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for this my son was dead, and he is alive; he was lost, and is found. And they began to rejoice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he, the elder son, was in the field; and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard the voice of music;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and he called one of the youths, and asked him what this was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He said to him, Thy brother hath come, and thy father hath killed the calf that was fat, because he hath received him well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was angry, and would not go in. And his father came forth and besought him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he said to his father, Behold, how many years have I wrought thee service, and never have I transgressed thy commandment: yet never hast thou given me a kid, that I might feast with my friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But this thy son, when he hath wasted thy substance with harlots, and hath come, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>His father saith to him, My son, thou in all time art with me, and every thing that I have is thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But to rejoice it behoves us, and to be glad, because this thy brother was dead, and is alive; and was lost, and is found.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
