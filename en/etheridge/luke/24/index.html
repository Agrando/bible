And they found the stone rolled from the sepulchre,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and entered, but found not the body of Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it was that while they were amazed at this, behold, two men stood over against them, and whose raiment shined;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and they were in fear, and bowed their faces to the earth. And they said to them, Why are you seeking the living with the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is not here, he is risen. Remember what he spake with you while he was in Galila,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and (when he) said, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of men of sins, and he will be crucified, and (in) the third of the days he will arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they remembered his words,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these (things) unto the eleven, and to the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now it was Mariam Magdalitha, Juchanon, and Mariam his mother, and Jacub, and the rest who were with them, who told these (occurrences) to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And these words appeared in their eyes as dreams, and they believed them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But Shemun arose, and ran to the sepulchre, and, looking in, he saw the linen clothes lying apart; and he went away, wondering in himself at what was done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>AND, behold, two of them in that day went to a village whose name was Emaos, and distant from Urishlem sixty stadia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they talked one with the other of all these (events) which had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And while they discoursed and investigated one with the other, Jeshu himself came and went with them, and walked with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And their eyes were holden, that they should not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, What are these words that you speak with each other, as you walk and are sad?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And one of them answered, whose name was Kleopha, and said to him, Art thou only a stranger from Urishlem, who knowest not what hath been done in it in these days?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He saith to them, What? They say to him, Concerning Jeshu, who was of Natsrath, a man who was a prophet, and mighty in word and in deed before Aloha, and before all the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the chief priests and elders delivered him to the judgment of death, and crucified him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But we had hoped that it was he who shall redeem Isroel; and, lo, three days (have passed) since all these things were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But women also of us have astonished us; for they were before at the sepulchre;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and when they found not his body, they came and told us that angels they had seen there, and (that) they had said concerning him that he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some also of us went to the sepulchre, and found even as the women had said, but him they saw not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then said Jeshu to them, O wanting in understanding, and hard of heart to believe all the things which the prophets have spoken!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Was it not to be that these the Meshicha should suffer, and enter into his glory?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And, beginning from Musha and all the prophets, he explained to them concerning himself from all the scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they drew near to that village to which they were going; and he made them suppose that to a more distant place he was going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they constrained him, and said to him, Abide with us, because the day now inclines to darken. And he went in to remain with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it was that, while he reclined with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And at once their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he was taken from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they said one to the other, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he spake with us by the way, and explained to us the scriptures?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they arose in the same hour, and returned to Urishlem, and found the eleven, who were assembled, and they who were with them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>saying, Assuredly our Lord is risen, and hath appeared unto Shemun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they also declared those things which had happened in the way, and how he was made known to them while he brake the bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>AND while they were discoursing, Jeshu stood among them, and said to them, Peace be with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I am; fear not. And they were troubled, and were in fear; for they thought they beheld a spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jeshu saith to them, Why are you perturbed, and why arise thoughts in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I: feel me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And while these words he spake, he showed them his hands and his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And while they as yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here somewhat to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they gave to him a portion of broiled fish, and of the comb of honey;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>and he took (and) did eat before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said to them, These are the words that I spoke with you while I was with you, that every thing must be fulfilled which is written in the law of Musha, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then opened he their minds, that they might understand the scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them, that so it is written, and so it was just, that the Meshicha should suffer, and should rise from among the dead in the three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and that in his name should be preached repentance and the forgiveness of sins among all nations, and that the commencement should be from Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And you are the witnesses of these. And I will send upon you the promise of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But await you in Urishlem the city until you be clothed with power from on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he brought them out unto Bethania, and lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And it was that while he blessed them, he was separated from them, and he ascended to the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they worshipped him, and returned to Urishlem with great joy. And at all time were they in the temple,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>praising and blessing Aloha. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
