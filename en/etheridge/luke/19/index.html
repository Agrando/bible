he was rich and chief of the publicans:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and he wished to see Jeshu, who he was, and could not for the crowd, because in his stature Zakai was small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he ran before Jeshu, and ascended a wild fig-tree to see him, because so he was about to pass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Jeshu came to that place, he saw him, and said to him, Be in haste, descend, Zakai; for to-day I must be at thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he was in haste, and descended, and received him rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when they all saw (this), they murmured, and said that with a man a sinner he hath gone in to abide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Zakai stood, and said to Jeshu, Behold, my Lord, the dividing of my wealth give I to the poor; and to every man, whatever I have wrongfully taken, fourfold I restore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jeshu saith to him, To-day is there salvation to this house, because this (man) also (is a) son of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the Son of man came to save that which was lost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they had heard these things, he added to speak a parable; because he had drawn nigh to Urishlem, and they expected that in that hour would be revealed the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said, A certain man of a noble house went into a distant country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he called his ten servants, and gave to them ten minin, and said to them, Trade till I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But his citizens hated him, and sent messengers after him, saying, We are not willing that this should reign over us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And having received the kingdom and returned, he spake to call to him those servants to whom he had given the silver, that he might know how every one of them had traded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the first came and said, My lord, thy mani ten minin hath gained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He saith to him, Well, good servant: because in a little thou art found faithful, thou shalt have rule over ten towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the second came and said, My lord, thy mani five minin hath made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He saith also to this, Thou also shalt have rule over five towns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the other came and said, My lord, behold thy mani which I have had with me, laid up in a napkin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I feared thee, because thou art a hard man, taking up what thou hadst not laid down, and reaping what thou sowedst not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He said to him, From thy own mouth I will judge thee, evil servant: thou didst know that I was a hard man, taking up what I had not laid down, and reaping what I sowed not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>why (then) gavest thou not my silver upon the table, that when I came I might require it with its increase?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And to those who stood before him he said, Take from him the mani, and give to him who hath the ten minin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They say to him, Our lord, he hath ten minin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He saith to them, I tell you, that to every one who hath (it) shall be given; and from him who hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But those adversaries who would not that I should reign over them, bring them, and slay them before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>AND when Jeshu had said these things, he went forward to go to Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he came to Bethphage and Beth-ania, at the mount that is called the Place of Olives, he sent two from his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and said to them, Go to the village over against us; and as you enter, behold, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man hath ridden: loose and bring him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if any man demand why you loose him, thus say: It is requested by our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they who were sent went and found as he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of him said to them, Why loose you the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they said to them, Because by our Lord it is requested.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought him to Jeshu; and they cast upon the colt their garments, and Jeshu rode upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as they went, they spread their clothes in the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when he had come nigh to the declivity of the Mount of Olives, the whole assembly of the disciples began to rejoice, and praise Aloha with a high voice, for all the mighty acts which they had seen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and they said, Blessed be the King who cometh in the name of the Lord! Peace in the heavens, and glory in the highest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But some of the Pharishee from among the multitudes say to him, Rabi, rebuke thy disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He saith to them, I tell you, if these should be silent, the stones would cry out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>AND when he approached, and saw the city, he wept over her, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>If thou hadst known these things which are for thy peace, and in this thy day! But now they are hidden from thine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the days will come to thee when thine enemies shall encompass thee and straiten thee on every side,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and they shall overthrow thee, and thy children within thee, and not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And as he went into the temple, he began to cast out those who bought in it and sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and said to them, It is written that my house is the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he taught every day in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people sought to destroy him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>but could not find what they might do to him; for all the people hung upon him to hear him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
