Nevertheless, when the Son of man shall come, will he find faith upon the earth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he spake this parable against some who trusted in themselves that they were just, and despised all (men):</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisha, the other a publican;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and, behold, the Pharisha stood (and) within himself these words prayed: Aloha, I thank thee that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious and unjust, and adulterers; nor as this publican.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I fast twice in the week, and tithe whatever I possess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But that publican stood from afar, and would not even his eyes lift up to heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, Aloha, be merciful to me a sinner!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I tell you that this one went down justified to his house, rather than that Pharisha. For every man who exalteth himself shall be humbled, and every one who humbleth himself shall be exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then they brought to him infants, that he should touch them: and the disciples saw it, and rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jeshu called them, and said to them, Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not; for of those who are as these,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>of them is the kingdom of heaven. Amen I say to you, That whoever does not receive the kingdom of Aloha as a child, shall not enter into it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>AND one of the rulers asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jeshu saith to him, Why callest thou me good, and none is good but one, Aloha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The commandments thou knowest, Thou shalt not kill, and, Thou shalt not commit adultery, and, Thou shalt not steal, and, Thou shalt not witness false testimony, Honour thy father and thy mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He saith to him, These all have I kept from my childhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when Jeshu heard this, he said to him, One thing is lacking with thee; go, sell whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he, when he heard these words, was grieved; for he was very rich.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Jeshu saw that he was grieved, he said, How difficult is it to those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of Aloha!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel into the aperture of a needle to enter, than the rich into the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They who heard said to him, And who can be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jeshu said, Those (things) which with the sons of men are not possible, with Aloha are possible to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Shemun Kipha said to him, Behold, we have forsaken every thing, and have come after thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeshu saith to him, Amen I say to you, That no man who leaveth houses, or fathers, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of Aloha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and shall not receive by two-fold (as) many in this time, and in the world that cometh the life that is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>AND Jeshu took the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Urishlem, and shall be fulfilled all (things) that are written in the prophets concerning the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he will be delivered to the Gentiles; and they will deride him, and spit in his face,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and will scourge him, and maltreat him, and kill him; and the third day he shall arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But not one of these understood they: for this word was hidden from them, and they knew not those sayings which were spoken with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And as he drew nigh to Jirichu, a certain blind man was sitting by the road-side, and begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he heard the voice of the multitude as it was passing, and asked what was this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They say to him, Jeshu Natsroya passeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he cried and said, Jeshu bar David, have mercy on me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they who went before Jeshu rebuked him, that he might be silent: but he cried out the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jeshu stood, and commanded that they should lead him unto him. And when he, approached him, he asked him and said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>What wilt thou I shall do for thee? And he said, My Lord, that I may see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jeshu said to him, See! thy faith hath saved thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And in an instant he saw, and came after him, and glorified Aloha: and all the people, when they saw, gave praise to Aloha.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
