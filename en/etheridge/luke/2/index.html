because there was no place for them where they stayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But there were shepherds in the country who were staying there, and keeping watch by night over their flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, behold, the angel of Aloha came to them, and the glory of the Lord shone upon them; and they feared with great fear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the angel said to them, Fear not; for, behold, I announce to you great joy, which shall be to all people:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for there is born for you to-day the Redeemer, who is the Lord the Meshicha, in the city of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And this is to you the sign, You shall find the infant wrapped in bandages, and laid in a manger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And instantly there were seen with the angel many hosts of the heavens, glorifying Aloha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and saying, Glory to Aloha in the heights, and upon earth peace and good hope for the sons of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the angels were gone from them into heaven, the shepherds spake one with another, and said, Let us go unto Beth-lechem, and see the thing which the Lord hath made known to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came with speed, and found Mariam, and Jauseph, and the infant who was laid in the manger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and when they saw, they showed the word which had been spoken to them concerning the child.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And all who heard wondered at those (things) which were told them by the shepherds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Mariam kept all these words, and compared them in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And those shepherds returned, glorifying and praising Aloha for all that they had seen and heard as they had been spoken to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>AND when the eight days completed to circumcise the child, his name was called Jeshu, for he was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when were completed, the days of their purification according to the law of Musha, they carried him up to Urishlem, to present him before the Lord:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, That every male openeth the matrix the holy to the Lord shall be called:)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to offer the sacrifice as it is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two of the young of pigeons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But there was a certain man in Urishlem, whose name was Shemun; and this man was just and righteous, and he had waited for the consolation of Isroel, and the Spirit of Holiness was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it was said to him from the Spirit of Holiness, that he should not see death, until he had seen the Meshicha of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, this man came in the Spirit to the temple, and when his parents brought in Jeshu the child, to do for him as it is commanded in the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>he took him upon his arms and blessed Aloha, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now dismiss thy servant, my Lord, according to thy word, in peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For lo, mine eyes have seen thy grace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which thou hast prepared in the face of all the nations;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>A light for the revelation of the peoples, And the glory of thy people Isroel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But Jauseph and his mother wondered at these words which were spoken concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Shemun blessed them, and said to Mariam his mother, Behold, this child is set for the ruin and uprising of many in Isroel, for the sign of contention.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And through thine own soul shall pass a spear, that may be revealed the reasonings of the hearts of many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>NOW Chana, the prophetess, (was) the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher; she was aged also in her days, and seven years with her husband had lived from her virginity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And she was a widow as of years eighty and four, and she removed not from the temple, and with fasting and with prayer she worshipped in the day and in the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And she also arose in that hour and confessed the Lord, and discoursed concerning him with all who were expecting the redemption of Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when they had fulfilled every thing according to the law of the Lord, they returned unto Galila, to Natsrath their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and was filled with wisdom; and the grace of Aloha was upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And his relatives every year went unto Urishlem at the feast of Petscha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>AND when he was a son of twelve years, they went up, as they were used, to the festival.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when the days (were) fulfilled, they returned. But Jeshu, the child, remained in Urishlem, and Jauseph and his mother knew not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For they thought that he was with the sons of the company; and when they had gone the journey of one day, they sought him with the men and with any who knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they found him not: and they returned again to Urishlem, and sought him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them and questioning them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all of them were astonished, as they heard him, at his wisdom and at his answers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when they saw him, they wondered; and his mother said to him, My son, why hast thou done with us thus? for, behold, I and thy father with great anxiety have sought thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>He saith to them, Why have you sought me (elsewhere)? Knew you not that (in) the house of my Father it behoveth me to be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But they did not comprehend the word that he spake to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went down with them, and came to Natsrath, and was subject to them. But his mother kept all these words in her heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>But Jeshu increased in his stature, and in his wisdom, and in favour with Aloha and men.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
