And begin not to say within yourselves that Abraham is father to us; for I tell you, that from these stones Aloha is able to raise up sons unto Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But, behold, the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore which good fruit maketh not, is cut down and into the fire falleth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the assemblies inquired of him, saying, What then shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered and said to them, Whoever hath two tunics, let him give to him who hath none; and whoever hath food, so let him do (likewise).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The publicans also came to be baptized, and they said to him, Malphona, what shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he said to them, Demand not any thing more upon what is prescribed to you to require.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the military servants asked of him and said, What shall we also do? And he said to them, Molest no man, oppress no man, and let your wages satisfy you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But while the people thought concerning Juchanon, and all of them reasoned in their hearts whether he were the Meshicha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Juchanon answered and said to them, Behold, I baptize you with waters, but there cometh after me He who is mightier than I; He, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to unloose; He shall baptize you with the Spirit of Holiness and with fire:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He who, holding the fan in his hand, and cleansing his floors, gathereth the wheat into his garners, and the chaff he will burn in the fire which is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But many other things he also taught and preached to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Herodes Tetrarka, because he was reproved by Juchanon concerning Herodia the wife of Philipos his brother, and concerning all the evil things which he had done,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>added this also upon all, and shut up Juchanon in the house of the chained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But it was when he had baptized all the people, and also Jeshu he baptized.
