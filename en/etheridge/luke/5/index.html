And when they had come, they filled those two vessels, so that they were nigh to be swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But when Shemun Kipha saw, he fell before the feet of Jeshu and said to him, I pray from thee, my Lord, remove thee from me, for I am a man a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For amazement had seized him, and all who were with him, on account of the draught of fishes which they had taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Even so also Jacub and Juchanon, sons of Zabdai, who were partners of Shemun. But Jeshu said, Fear not, from henceforth the sons of men shalt thou catch unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they brought the vessels to land, and forsook every thing, and went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>AND when Jeshu was in one of the cities, there came a certain man who was wholly filled with leprosy; he saw Jeshu, and fell upon his face, and prayed of him, and said to him, My Lord, if thou art willing, thou canst make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jeshu extended his hand, touched him, and said to him, I am willing; be clean. And in an instant his leprosy went from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he commanded him, Tell no man, but go show thyself to the priests, and offer the oblation for thy cleansing, as Musha ordained for their testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the fame concerning him went forth the more, and much people were gathered together to hear him and to be healed from their diseases.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he passed away into the desert, and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was on one of the days, while Jeshu was teaching, (certain) Pharishee and doctors of the law were sitting. And they had come from all the villages of Galila and of Jehud, and from Urishlem: and the power of the Lord was (there) to heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And some brought on a couch a certain man a paralytic; and they sought to enter, that they might set him before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when they found not how to bring him in because of the multitude of people, they ascended to the house-top, and sent him with his couch from the roof into the midst before Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when Jeshu saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Man, forgiven to thee are thy sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Sophree and Pharishee began to reason and to say, Who is this who speaketh blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but Aloha only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jeshu knew their reasoning, and said to them, What reason you in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Which is easier, to say, Forgiven to thee are thy sins; or to say, Arise, walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But that you may know that authority hath the Son of man in the earth to forgive sins,-he saith to the paralytic,-To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thine house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediately he arose before them, and took up his couch, and went to his house, glorifying Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And amazement held every man; and they glorified Aloha, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen today wonders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After these things Jeshu went forth, and saw a tribute-taker, whose name was Levi, sitting at the house of tribute. And he said to him, Come after me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and he left every thing, and arose, and went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Levi made in his house a great feast; and there was a large company of tribute-takers, and of others that reclined with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the Sophree and Pharishee murmured, saying to his disciples, Why with tribute-takers and sinners eat you and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, The whole do not require the physician, but they who are grievously ill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am not come to call the just, but the sinners, to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But they say to him, Why do the disciples of Juchanon constantly fast, and pray also as the Pharishee, but thine eat and drink?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But he said to them, How can you make the sons of the chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken up from them: then shall they fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He spake to them a parable: No man cutteth a piece from a new material, and fasteneth it upon an old garment; lest he rend the new, without completing the old with the piece that is new.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And no man poureth new wine into old bottles; lest the new wine burst forth, and the wine be shed, and the bottles perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But they pour new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And no man, drinking old wine, immediately asketh new: for he saith, The old is softer.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
