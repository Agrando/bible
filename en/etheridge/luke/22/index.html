Is not he who reclineth? But I am among you as he who serveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You are they who have remained with me in my temptations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I promise to you, as hath promised to me my Father, a kingdom;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that you may eat and drink at the table in my kingdom, and may sit upon thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Isroel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>AND Jeshu said to Shemun, Shemun, behold, Satana, demandeth to sift thee as wheat;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may not fail: and thou also, in the time that thou art converted, confirm thy brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But Shemun said to him, My Lord, with thee I am prepared, and for the house of the bound, and for death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jeshu saith to him, I tell thee, Shemun, that the cock will not crow to-day, till three times thou hast denied that thou knowest me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, or scrip, or shoes, was any thing wanting to you? They say to him, Nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He saith to them, Henceforth, he who hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip also; and he who hath not a sword, let him sell his garment and buy a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I tell you also, that what is written must be fulfilled in me, that with the transgressors he was numbered: for all which concerns me must be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And they say to him, Our Lord, behold, here are two swords. He saith to them, They suffice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he came forth, and went, as he was used, to the mount of the Place of Olives; and his disciples also went after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when come unto the spot, he said to them, Pray that you enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he removed from them as (about the distance of) a stone's throw, and bowed the knee, and prayed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and said, Father, if thou wilt, let this cup pass: nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And an angel appeared to him from heaven, who strengthened him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in terror, more vehemently he prayed, and his sweat was as drops of blood, and fell upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he arose from prayer, and came to his disciples, and found them asleep, from sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he said to them, Why sleep you? arise and pray, that you enter not into temptation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And as he was speaking, behold a multitude, and behold him who was called Jihuda, one of the twelve, coming before them, and he came nigh to Jeshu, and kissed him: for this was the sign he had given to them, He whom I shall kiss is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jeshu saith to him, Jihuda, with the kiss betrayest thou the Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But when they who were with him saw what was done, they say to him, Our Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and took off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Jeshu answered and said, It sufficeth until this; and he touched his ear which he had struck, and healed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jeshu said to them who had come against him, the chief priests, and elders, and the chiefs of the forces of the temple, As against a thief are you come forth against me, with swords and clubs to take me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Every day with you have I been in the temple, and you did not stretch forth upon me (your) hands; but this is your hour and the power of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they took (and) brought him to the house of the chief of the priests; and Shemun came after him from afar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting around it, and Shemun also sat with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a certain damsel saw him as he sat by the fire, and, looking at him, she said, This also was with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied, and said, Woman, I know him not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a little while, another saw him, and said, Thou also art of them. But Kipha said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And after one hour another contended and said, Assuredly this also was with him, for he is also a Galiloya.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Kipha saith, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And at once, while he was speaking, the cock crew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And Jeshu turned, and looked upon Kipha; and Shemun remembered his word which our Lord had spoken to him, that before the cock shall crow thou wilt have denied me three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Shemun went without and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men who held Jeshu mocked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and veiled him, and they struck him upon the face, saying, Prophesy, who struck thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And many other things they blasphemed and spake against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>AND when it dawned, the elders and chief priests and the Sophree came together, and took him into the house of their assembly; saying to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Art thou the Meshicha? tell us. He saith to them, Should I tell you, you would not believe me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and were I to ask you, you would not return me a word, nor release me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Henceforth the Son of man sitteth at the right hand of the power of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Then said they all, Thou art, then, the Son of Aloha? Jeshu saith to them, You say that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>They say, Why yet need we witnesses? for we have heard from his mouth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
