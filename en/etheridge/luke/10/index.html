And remove not from house to house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And into whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat such things as are set to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And heal those who are sick, and say to them, There hath drawn nigh upon you the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if any city which you enter will not receive you, go you out into the street and say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Even the dust which cleaveth to our feet from your city we shake off against you; nevertheless know this, that hath come nigh upon you the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I tell you that for Sadum it shall be more tolerable in that day than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Woe to thee, Kurazin! woe to thee, Bethtsaida! for if in Tsur and Tsaidon had been wrought the miracles which were wrought in you, now long since in sackcloth and in ashes would they have repented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless for Tsur and for Tsaidon it shall be more tolerable in the day of the judgment, than for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And thou, Kapher-nachum, which unto heaven art lifted up, unto Shiul shalt thou be abased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He that you heareth, me heareth; and he who you rejecteth, me he rejecteth; and he who me rejecteth, he rejecteth him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the seventy whom he had sent, returned with great joy, saying to him, Our Lord, the demons also are subjected to us through thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then he said to them, I saw him, Satana, when he fell as lightning from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, I give you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and all the strength of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the demons are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour Jeshu exulted in the Holy Spirit, and said, I praise thee, my Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and the intellectual, and hast revealed them unto children. Yes, my Father, for so was thy will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he turned to his disciples, and said to them, Every thing is delivered to me by my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is but the Father; and who the Father is but the Son, and he to whom the Son willeth to reveal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he turned to his disciples by themselves, and said, Blessed are your eyes because they see what you see;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for I tell you that prophets many and kings have desired to see what you see, and have not seen, and to hear what you hear, and have not heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>AND, behold, a certain Sophra stood up to try him, saying, Malphona, what shall I do to inherit everlasting life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jeshu said to him, In the law how is it written, how readest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He answered and said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy Aloha with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jeshu said to him, Thou hast said correctly. This do, and thou shalt live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he, willing to justify himself, said to him, And who is my neighbour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jeshu saith to him, A certain man went down from Urishlem to Jerichu, and fell among robbers, who stripped him and wounded him, and left him with little life subsisting in him, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And a certain priest happened to go down by that way, and he saw him and passed over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And likewise also a Levoia, being come to that place, beheld him, and passed over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But a man, a Shomroya, while he journeyed, came where he was, and saw him, and had compassion on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and went near, and bound up his wounds, and poured in upon them wine and oil, and set him upon his ass, and brought him to the inn, and was anxious for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And on the morning of the day, he took out two dinoreen, gave to the host, and said to him, Take care of him; and if more thou layest out, when I return I will give to thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Which therefore of these three doth it appear to thee was neighbour to him who fell into the hands of the thieves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said, He who had compassion on him. Jeshu saith to him, Go thou also and do likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>AND it was that as they went in the way, he entered into a certain village, and a woman whose name was Martha received him into her house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And she had a sister whose name was Mariam, and she came, sat at the feet of our Lord, and heard his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Martha was occupied with much serving. And she came and said to him, My Lord, carest thou not that my sister leave me alone to serve? Tell her to help me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jeshu answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and disturbed about many,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>but (there) is the one that is needed. And Mariam the good portion hath chosen, that which shall not be taken from her.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
