And there was a man whose right hand was dried:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the Sophree and Pharishee watched him, if he would heal on the shabath, that they might accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man whose hand was dried, Rise (and) come into the midst of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when he had come and stood, Jeshu said to them, I ask you which is lawful to do on the shabath, good or evil, life to save or to destroy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he beheld them all, and said to him, Stretch forth thine hand: and he stretched it forth, and his hand was restored as its fellow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But they were filled with envy, and spake one with another what they should do with Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>BUT it was in those days that Jeshu went forth into a mountain to pray; and there remained he all night in the prayer of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the day brake, he called his disciples, and chose from them twelve, those whom he named Apostles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Shemun, he whose name was Kipha, and Andreas his brother, and Jacub, and Juchanon, and Philipos, and Bar Tholmai,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and Mathai, and Thoma, and Jakub bar Chalphai, and Shemun who was called the Zealous,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and Jihuda bar Jakub, and Jihuda Scaruta, he who was the traitor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jeshu descended with them, and stood in the plain, and a great assembly of his disciples and a multitude of people from all Jehud, and from Urishlem, and from the sea-coast of Tsur and Tsaidon,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who had come to hear his words, and to be healed of their diseases; and they who were vexed by unclean spirits, and they were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And all the multitudes sought to approach to him, for the power went forth from him, and all of them he healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>AND he lifted up his eyes upon his disciples, and said, Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Blessed are you when the sons of man hate you, and separate you, and revile you, and cast out your name as evil, for the sake of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Rejoice in that day, and exult, for your reward is great in heaven; for thus did they to your fathers the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But woe to you (who are) rich, because you have received your consolation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you (who are) full, for you shall hunger. Woe to you who laugh now, for you shall weep and lament.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe to you when the sons of men shall speak well of you, for so did to the prophets of falsity their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But I say to you who hear, Love your adversaries, and do good to those who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and bless those who execrate you, and pray for those who lead you by violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And to one who striketh you on your cheek, offer to him the other: and whosoever taketh your cloak, forbid him not your coat also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>To every one who asketh of you give; and from him who taketh of yours demand not (again).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as you will that the sons of man should do to you, so do you also to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For if you love them who love you, what is your grace? for sinners also love those who love them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And if you do good to those who benefit you, what is your grace? for the sinners also thus do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend to them from whom you expect to be recompensed, what is your grace? for sinners also lend to sinners, that they might be profited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your adversaries, and do good to them, and lend, and cut not off the hope of any one; and great shall be your reward, and you shall be the children of the Most High; for he is benign to the evil and to the ungrateful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be you therefore merciful, as also your Father is merciful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>JUDGE not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned; release, and you shall be released;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>give, and it shall be given to you; in good measure, compressed, redundant, shall they pour into your bosoms. For in that measure you mete, it shall be measured to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he spake to them a parable: How can the blind lead the blind, and not fall into the ditch?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>The disciple than his master is not greater; but every man who is perfect shall be as his master.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For why behold you the rod that is in the eye of your brother, but the rafter in your (own) eye is not seen by you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Or how can you say to your brother, My brother, permit (that) I pull out the rod that is in your eye, and behold the rafter in your own eye is not seen by you? Hypocrite! first take out the rafter from your own eye, and then shall you see to take out the rod that is in the eye of your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>A good tree maketh not evil fruits; also an evil tree maketh not good fruits:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for every tree by its fruits is known. For how gather they from thorns figs? neither also from the bramble do they gather in grapes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The good man, from the good treasures which are in his heart, bringeth forth good things; and the evil man, from the evil treasures which are in his heart, bringeth forth evil things; for from the adundancies of the heart the lips speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Why call you me, My Lord, my Lord, and the things which I say do not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Every man who cometh to me and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He is like a man who built a house, and digged deep, and laid the foundations upon the rock: but when there was an inundation, the inundation beat against that house, and it could not shake it, for its foundations were set upon a rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he who heareth and doeth not, is like a man who built his house upon the dust, without a foundation: and when the river beat against it, it immediately fell, and the ruin was great of that house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
