I cannot dig, and to beg I am ashamed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I know what I will do, that when I shall be put out of the house-headship, they may receive me into their houses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he called one by one from the debtors of his lord, and said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to him, An hundred metres of oil. He saith to him, Take thy book, and sit down quickly, and write fifty metres.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he said to another, And thou, how much owest thou to my lord? He saith to him, An hundred kureen of wheat. He saith to him, Take thy book, and sit down, write eighty kureen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And praised our Lord the house-chief who was unjust, in that he had done wisely; for the sons of this world are wiser than the sons of light in this their generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also I say unto you, Make to you friends from this wealth of unrighteousness, that, when perfect, they may receive you into the tabernacles of eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whoever in the little is faithful, in the great also is faithful; and he who in the little is unjust, in the great also is unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If, therefore, in the wealth of unrighteousness you have not been faithful, the truth to you who will confide?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if in that which is not yours you are not found faithful, your own who will give to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>No man can serve two lords; for either the one he will hate, and the other he will love; or the one he will honour, and the other despise. You cannot serve Aloha and wealth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Pharishee, when they heard all these things, because they loved money, derided him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jeshu said to them, You are they who justify yourselves before the sons of men; but Aloha knoweth your hearts. For, what is exalted among men, before Aloha is abominable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The law and the prophets were until Juchanon; from thenceforth the kingdom of Aloha is preached, and every one presseth to enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than one letter from the law to pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Every one who looseth his wife, and taketh another, committeth adultery; and every one who taketh the dismissed, committeth adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>NOW there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in byssos and purple, and every day feasted gaily.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was a certain poor man, whose name was Lo贸zar; and he lay at the gate of him who was rich, bruised with wounds,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and desired to fill his belly with the crumbs which fell from the table of that rich. And also the dogs came and licked his wounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now that poor man died, and angels conducted him to the bosom of Abraham: but that rich man also died, and was buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And, tormented in shiul, he lifted up his eyes afar, and seeth Abraham, and Lo贸zar in his bosom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he cried with a high voice, and said, My father Abraham, have compassion upon me, and send Lo贸zar, that he may dip the top of his finger in waters, and moisten my tongue; for, behold, I am tormented in this flame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Abraham said to him, My son, remember that thou didst receive thy goods in thy life, and Lo贸zar his evils, and now, behold, he reposeth here, and thou art tormented.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And with all these, there is a great void set between us and you, that they who would pass from hence unto you are not able, nor they also who would pass from thence to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He said to him, I pray thee, then, my father, to send him unto my father's house:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for five brethren have I; let him go and testify unto them, that they also come not to this place of torment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Abraham said to him, They have Musha and the prophets, let them hear them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he said to him, No, my father Abraham, but if one from the dead shall go unto them, they repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Abraham saith to him, If Musha and the prophets they hear not, neither, if one from the dead should rise, would they believe him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
