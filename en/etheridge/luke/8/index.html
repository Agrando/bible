And as he sowed, some fell by the road-side; and it was trodden down, and the fowl devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And other fell upon the rock; and it immediately sprang up, and, because it had no moisture, it withered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And other fell among thorns, and they sprang up with it, and choked it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And other fell into ground good and fair, and sprang up, and made fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these (words), he cried, Whoever hath ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And his disciples asked him, What is (the signification of) this parable?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But he said to them, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Aloha; but to those who are the rest in similitudes is it spoken; that while seeing they may not see, and while hearing they may not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But this is the parable: The seed is the word of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now they by the road-side are they who hear the word; and the adversary cometh, and taketh up the word from their hearts, that they should not believe and be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But those who fell upon the rock are those who, when they hear, with joy receive the word; yet root they have not, but for a time is their faith, and in the time of temptation they are offended.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But that which fell among thorns are they who hear the word, and by the cares, and by the riches, and by the lusts of the world, they are choked, and fruit they give not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But that which (was) in good ground are they who, with hearts humble and good, hear the word and retain, and give fruits with perseverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>NO man lighteth a lamp, and covereth it with a measure, or setteth it under a bed; but setteth it upon a candlestick, that every one who cometh in may see the light of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be revealed, and nothing secret that shall not be known and come into openness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Take heed how you hear: for unto him who hath, it shall be given; and from him who hath not, that also which he thinketh that he hath shall be taken from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not speak with him on account of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they said to him, Thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, desiring to see thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he answered and said to them, These are my mother and my brethren, they who hear the word of Aloha, and do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>NOW it was on one of the days that Jeshu ascended and sat in a vessel and his disciples: and he said to them, Let us pass to the other side of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But as they went, Jeshu himself slept. And there became a storm of wind on the water, and nigh was the vessel to be swallowed up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they approached (and) awoke him, saying to him, Our master, our master, we perish! But he arose and rebuked the winds and the waves of the sea; and they quieted, and there was a calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, Where is your faith? But they, afraid, wondered, saying one with another, Who is this that also commandeth the winds, and to whom the waves and the sea are obedient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they went forward and came to the country of the Godroyee, which is over against Galila.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he had gone forth to the land, there met him a certain man from the city, who had a devil in him a great time, and (who) wore no clothes, and in a house dwelt not, but in the place of the buried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when he saw Jeshu, he cried out, and fell before him, and said in a high voice, What to us and to thee, Jeshu, son of Aloha Marima? I beseech of thee, torment me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For Jeshu commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the man. For long was the time that he had been enthralled of him; and (when) bound with chains, and kept with fetters, he had burst asunder his bonds, and had been driven by the demon into the waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jeshu demanded of him, What is thy name? He saith to him, Legion: because that many devils had entered into him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they besought from him that he would not cast them out to go into the abyss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now there was there a great herd of many swine which fed on the hill: and they besought from him that he would permit them to enter into the swine. And he permitted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the demons went forth from the man, and entered into the swine; and the whole herd went directly to the precipice, and plunged into the waters, and were suffocated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the herdmen saw the thing that was done, they fled, and made known in the city and in the villages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the men went forth to see the thing which was done. And they came to Jeshu, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, clothed, sober, and sitting at the feet of Jeshu. And they feared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they who had seen it showed to them how the man of the demon had been healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the whole multitude of the Godroyee besought of Jeshu that he would go from them, because great fear had taken them. And he, Jeshu, ascended the ship, and returned from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he, the man from whom had gone forth the demons, besought of him that he might be with him. But Jeshu dismissed him, and said to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Return to thine house, and show what Aloha hath done for thee. And he went and proclaimed in every city what Jeshu had done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>WHEN Jeshu returned, a great multitude received him: for they were all expecting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And a certain man whose name was Jorush, head of the synagogue, fell before the feet of Jeshu, and besought him to enter into his house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>for he had an only daughter, as a daughter of twelve years, and she was nigh unto death. And as Jeshu went with him, the great multitude pressed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And a certain woman whose blood had gushed forth twelve years, she who among the physicians had spent all her substance, but could not be healed by any one,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>approached him from behind, and touched the border of his garment, and immediately stood the flowing of her blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jeshu said, Who touched me? And when all denied, Shemun Kipha and those with him said, Raban, the crowd straiteneth and presseth thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But he said, Some one hath touched me, for I know that power hath gone forth from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And she, the woman, when she saw that she was not hid, came trembling and fell (and) worshipped him. And she told before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how at once she had been healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he, Jeshu, said to her, Be comforted, my daughter: thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And while he was speaking, there came a man from the chief of the synagogue and said to him, Thy daughter is dead, weary not the Malphona.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But Jeshu heard, and said to the father of the damsel, Fear not, only believe, and she lives!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jeshu came to the house, and he suffered no man to enter with him, save Shemun, and Jakub, and Juchanon, and the father of the damsel, and her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And they were all weeping and wailing for her; but Jeshu said, Weep not, for she is not dead, but asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they laughed at him, for they knew that she was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But he put every man forth without. And he took her by the hand, and called and said, Damsel, arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And her spirit returned, and she arose. And he directed that they should give her to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And her parents were astonished; but he cautioned them that no man they should tell what he had done.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
