But the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he added and sent another servant; but they beat him also, and maltreated him, and sent him away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he added and sent a third; but they also wounded him, and cast him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The lord of the vinery saith, What shall I do? I will send my son, the beloved; now will they see him and reverence him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they cast him out of the vinery, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vinery do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give the vinery to others. But when they heard, they said, May this not be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he beheld them, and said, And what is that which is written, The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And every one who shall fall upon this stone shall be broken; and every one on whom it shall fall it will scatter him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the chief priests and Sophree sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; but they feared the people, for they knew that concerning them(selves) he had spoken this parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they sent to him spies, who should resemble just men, that they might take him in discourse, and deliver him to the judgment and to the authority of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, and said to him, Doctor, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly, neither dost thou deceive, but with integrity thou teachest the way of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it lawful for us to give head-silver to Cesar or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he understood their subtilty, and said, Why tempt you me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Show me a dinara. Of whom upon it is the image and the inscription? But they said, Of Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jeshu saith to them, Give then of Cesar's to Cesar, and of Aloha's unto Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they could not take hold of his words before the people; and they wondered at his answer, and were silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>BUT some of the Zadukoyee approached, they who say that there is no resurrection;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and they questioned him, and said to him, Doctor, Musha wrote to us that if a man's brother die having a wife who hath not children, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But there were seven brethren; and the first took; a wife, and died without children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the second took his wife, and he died without children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the third also took her; and so also the seven of them: and they died and left no children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Died in the end also the woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In the resurrection therefore, whose of them shall she be the wife? for the seven of them had taken her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jeshu saith to them, The sons of this world take wives, and women become (the wives) of men:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but they who of that world are worthy, and of the resurrection which is from among the dead, take not wives, neither do women become (the wives) of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Neither again can they die, for they are as the angels; and the children are they of Aloha, because they have become the children of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But that the dead arise, Musha also showeth; for he commemorateth at the bush, while he saith, The Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Ishok, and the God of Jakub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But he was not the God of the dead, but of the living: for they all live unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Sophree answered and said to him, Doctor, thou hast well said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they dared not question him again of any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>AND he said to them, How say the Sophree concerning the Meshicha, that he is the Son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>until I put thine adversaries beneath thy feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>If David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he his son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And while all the people heard, he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Beware of the Sophree, who will to walk in stoles, and love the shaloma in public places, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the chief reclining-places at evening feasts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour the houses of widows, and for the occasion prolong their prayers: these shall receive the greater judgment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
