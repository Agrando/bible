These things teach and require of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But if there be a man who teacheth other doctrine, and who accedeth not to the healthful words of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and to the doctrine of the fear of Aloha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>this (is one) who extolleth himself while knowing nothing, but is infirm with disputation and questioning of words, from which are envy, and contention, and evil speaking, and supposition in the evil mind,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and conflicts of men whose minds are corrupt and deprived of the truth, and who consider that gain is the fear of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But thou, remove thyself from them. For our gain is great which is the fear of Aloha, with the use of our sufficiency.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nothing brought we into the world, and we know that nothing we are able to take from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore sufficient to us are food and raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But they who will be rich fall into temptations and snares, and many lusts which befool and injure, and which plunge men into destruction and perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the root of all evil is the love of money; and there are who have coveted it, and from the faith have erred, and have made themselves enter into many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But thou, O man of God, from these things flee, and follow after righteousness, and after equity, and after faith, and after charity, and after patience, and after meekness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And contend in the good agony of faith, and lay hold of the life which is eternal, unto which thou art called, and hast confessed a good confession before many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I ATTEST thee before Aloha, who vivifieth all, and Jeshu Meshiha, who witnessed before Pontius Pilatos the good testimony,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that thou keep (this) commandment without spot and without blemish, until the manifestation of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>whom in his time will show Aloha the blessed and only Strong One, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>he who only is incorruptible, and (who) dwelleth in light which no man can approach; whom no man of men hath seen, nor is able to see: to him be honour and power for ever and ever. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The rich of this world instruct, that they be not uplifted in their minds, nor be trustful upon riches which have no security, but upon Aloha the living, who giveth to us all abundantly for our comfort;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and that they perform good works, and become rich in welldoings, and be ready to give and to communicate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and lay for themselves a good foundation for that which is to be, that they may lay hold on the true life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy, watch over that which is confided to thee, and fly from vain words, and the turnings of false knowledge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For they who pursue it err from the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
