For already have some begun to turn aside after Satana.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them support them, that they may not be burden-some on the church, that they who are widows indeed may have sufficient.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Those presbyters who well conduct themselves shall be worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and in doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox in the treading out; and, Worthy is the labourer of his hire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Against a presbyter an accusation receive not, except on the mouth of two or three witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Those who sin before all men reprove, that the rest may be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I attest thee before Aloha and our Lord Jeshu Meshiha and his elect angels, that thou keep these, (precepts,) and let not thy mind be pre-occupied by any thing, and do nothing with acceptance of persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The hand suddenly on any man lay not, neither participate in others' sins. Keep thyself in purity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And henceforth water drink not, but wine a little drink, on account of thy stomach, and on account of thy constant infirmities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>THERE are men whose sins are known, and they precede them to the place of judgment; and there are whose (sins) go after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So also good men are known; and those who are otherwise cannot be hid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
