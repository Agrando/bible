and be manifest among them as luminaries in the world,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to be unto them for a place of salvation, for my exultation in the day of the Meshiha, that I may not have run in vain, nor laboured to no purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, also, offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad, and rejoice with you all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>so also you be glad and rejoice with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I hope in our Lord Jeshu to send Timotheos to you soon, that I also may have quietness when I learn concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I have no other who is so as my (own) soul, who will diligently take care for yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For all are seeking what is theirs, and not what is of Jeshu Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the proof of this you know, that as a son with his father, so hath he wrought with me in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him, therefore, I hope to send to you speedily, when I shall have seen what with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I confide on my Lord, that I also speedily shall come unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now the matter hath pressed me to send to you the brother Epaphroditos, who is a helper and labourer with me, but your messenger and minister to my necessity;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for he desired to see you all, and was anxious, because he knew that you had heard that he was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yes, he was sick, unto death; but Aloha had mercy upon him; but not upon him only, but upon me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Urgently, therefore, have I sent him to you, that when you have seen him again you may rejoice, and that I may have a little breathing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Receive him, then, in the Lord with all joy; and those who are such, hold in estimation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because for the work of the Meshiha he had come nigh unto death, and was disregardful of his life, that he might accomplish that which you had wanted in the service which concerned me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
