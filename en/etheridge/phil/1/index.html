I desire to be set free, that I might be with the Meshiha, and this is greatly preferable to me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but also to remain in my body is the thing which constraineth me on your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I know this confidently, that I am to remain and tarry for your joy and for the increase of your faith:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that when I come again to you, your glorying which is in Jeshu Meshiha alone shall abound in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>As it becometh the gospel of the Meshiha, so have your conversation; that if coming I see you, or absent, I may hear of you, that you stand in one spirit and in one soul, conquering together for the faith of the gospel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>in nothing moved by them who stand against us, to the forthshowing of their perdition, and of our salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And this from Aloha hath been given to you, not only believing to believe in the Meshiha, but also for his sake to suffer,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and to sustain a conflict, as you have seen in me, and now hear concerning me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
