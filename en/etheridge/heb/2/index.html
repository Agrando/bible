Those which began by our Lord to be spoken, and by them who from him heard them in us were confirmed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>when Aloha witnessed concerning them by signs, and by miracles, and by various powers, and by distributed gifts of the Spirit of Holiness, that were bestowed according to his will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it was not to the angels he subjected the world which is future, of which we discourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But, as the scripture testifieth and saith, What is man, that thou rememberedst him, and the Son of man, that thou didst visit him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thou didst humble him (to be) less than the angels; glory and honour hast thou placed upon his head, and hast empowered him over the work of thy hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and every thing hast thou put in subjection under his feet. in this, that he subjected every thing to him, he hath left nothing which he hath not subjected. Yet hitherto we see not that every thing is subjected to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But him who was humbled to be less than the angels, we see to be JESHU himself, for the sake of the passion of his death; and glory and honour set upon his head; for He Aloha, in his grace, for every man hath tasted death!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was proper to him by whose hand are all, and on account of whom all are, (and who) would lead many sons to his glory, that the Prince of their salvation by sufferings should be perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For he who sanctified, and they who are sanctified, are all from one: wherefore he has not been ashamed to call them his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>(As) when he saith, I will announce thy name unto my brethren, and in the midst of the church I will praise thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again, I will put my confidence in him. And again, Behold me, and the sons whom thou hast given me, Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Forasmuch as the sons have been made to participate in flesh and blood, he also likewise was made a partaker of these very things; that by his death he might abolish him who held the power of death, who is Satana,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and set loose them who in the fear of death had been all their lives subjected to servitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For not from the angels he took, but from the seed of Abraham he took.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore it was right that in every thing he should be rendered like unto his brethren, that he might be compassionate, and a High Priest faithful in to Aloha, and become an expiation for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in this, that he hath suffered and been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
