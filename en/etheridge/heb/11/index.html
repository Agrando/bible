Wherefore Aloha was not ashamed their God to be called; for he hath prepared for them a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham offered Ishok in his temptation and his only-born he lifted upon the altar, even him whom he had received by the promise:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for it had been said to him, In Ishok shall be called to thee the seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For he thought within himself, that Aloha could even from the dead upraise: and on account of this in a similitude he was given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith in that which was to come, Ishok blessed Jakub and Isu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith, when dying, Jakub blessed each of the sons of Jauseph; and worshipped upon the head of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Jauseph, when dying, was mindful of the going forth of the sons of Israel, and commanded concerning his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith the parents of Musha concealed him when he had been born three months, because they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they feared not the edict of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Musha, when he became a man, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pherun;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and chose to himself to be in affliction with the people of Aloha, and not for a little time to delight (himself) in sin;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and considered the riches of the reproach of Meshiha to be far greater than the treasures of Metsreen: for he contemplated the recompence of the reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he forsook Metsreen, and feared not the wrath of the king; and hoped, as one who beheld Aloha who is the invisible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith they performed the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that he might not come near,-he, who was destroying the first-born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they traversed the sea of Sooph, as those who (march) upon dry land; but the Metsroyee were swallowed up in it, when they had dared to enter it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the ramparts of Jirichu fell down, after they had been encompassed seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith Rachob the harlot perished not with those who would not hearken, because she had received the explorers in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What shall I yet say? For (too) brief is the time for me to tell of Gedhun, and of Borok, and of Shemshun, and of Nephtoch, and of David, and of Shomuel, and of the rest of the prophets;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>they who through faith conquered kingdoms, and wrought righteousness, and received promises, and shut the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and quenched the powers of fire, and were delivered from the edge of the sword, and were made strong from infirmities, and became valiant in battle, and overthrew the camps of the adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they gave unto women their sons by the resurrection of the dead; and others in torments died, nor hoped to be delivered, that the better resurrection they might have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But others went through mockings and scourgings; others unto chains and imprisonments were given up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>others were stoned, others divided, others died by the edge of the sword, others wandered about clothed with skins of sheep and of goats, necessitous, afflicted, and driven out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Men, of whom the world was not worthy, became as wanderers in the desert, and in mountains, and in dens, and in caverns of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And these all, of whom there hath been (such) a testimony concerning their faith, received not the promise;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>because Aloha had afore contemplated for our help, that without us they should not be made perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
