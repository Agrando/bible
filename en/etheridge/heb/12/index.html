For if an animal should approach to the mountain, it was to be stoned:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and so terrible was the sight, that Musha said, I fear and tremble</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But ye have come nigh unto the Mount of Ziun, and to the city of Aloha the Living, to the Urishlem which is in heaven, and to the congregation of myriads of angels,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and to the church of the firstborn (ones) who are written in heaven, and to Aloha the Judge of all, and to the spirits of the just who are perfected,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and to Jeshu the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the sprinkling of his blood, which speaketh better than that of Habel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Beware, therefore, lest ye be averse from Him who hath spoken with you; for if they escaped not who were averse from one who spake with them on earth, how much less we, if we withdraw from one who hath spoken to us from heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Him whose voice moved the earth? But now hath he promised and said, Yet once I will move not only earth, but also heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But that which he hath said, ONCE, showeth the (final) changing of these which are moved, because they are made, that those may remain which are immutable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore because we have received the kingdom which is immoveable, let us hold the grace by which we may serve and please Aloha with reverence and with fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>for our God is a devouring fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
