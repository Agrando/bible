Or why again another foundation lay you for repentance from dead works, and for faith which is in Aloha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and for the doctrine of ablution and of imposition of the hand, and for the resurrection from the place of the dead, and for the judgment which is eternal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If the Lord permit, we will do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But they who once unto baptism have descended, and have tasted the gift which is from heaven, and have received the Spirit of Holiness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and have tasted the good word of Aloha, and the power of the world to come,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>(and) who again shall sin, cannot again be renewed unto conversion, who would afresh crucify and put to shame the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the earth that hath drunk the rain which hath come upon it many times, and shall have brought forth the herb that is useful for them on whose account it is cultured, receiveth blessing from Aloha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but that which shall produce thorns and briers hath reprobation; nor is it far from the curse, but its end is burning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But we are persuaded concerning you, my brethren, those things which are good, and that draw nigh unto salvation, though thus we speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For not unrighteous is Aloha, that he should forget your works and your charity which ye have manifested in his name, who have ministered unto the saints, and do minister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But we desire that every one of you manifest the same diligence for the full completion of your hope until the end;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and that it be not cut off from you, but that ye be imitators of them who by fidelity and patience have become heirs of the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For when to Abraham Aloha gave promise, because there was no one greater than himself to swear by, he sware by his own Self,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and said, Blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And so he waited patiently, and obtained the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For men swear by one greater than themselves: and every controversy which occurs among them hath a sure conclusion in the oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On this account Aloha, willing abundantly to manifest to the heirs of the promise that his engagement is changeless, hath bound it in an oath:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>that by two things that are not changed, in which it cannot be that Aloha should lie, great consolation should be ours who have fled unto him: and that we may retain the hope that is promised to us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>which we have as an anchor that holdeth our soul, that it may not be moved, and entereth within the veil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>where Jeshu hath first entered for us, and become the Priest for ever in the likeness of MALKI-ZEDEK.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
