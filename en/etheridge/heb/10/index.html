In this he hath done away with the first, that he may establish the second.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For by this his will we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jeshu Meshiha, which was once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For every high priest who stood and ministered every day, offered the same sacrifices, which can never purify (from) sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But this one sacrifice hath offered for sins, and hath sat down at the right hand of Aloha for ever:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>waiting from henceforth until his adversaries are set as a footstool beneath his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For by one offering he hath perfected those who are sanctified through him for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the witness unto us is the Spirit of Holiness, when he saith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the covenant that I will give to them from after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my law in their minds, and upon their hearts will I inscribe it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and their iniquity and their sins I will not remember against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>BUT WHERE THERE IS REMISSION OF SINS, THERE IS NOT REQUIRED AN OFFERING FOR SINS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We have, therefore, my brethren, confidence to enter the holy place through the blood of Jeshu;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and a way of life which he hath now made new to us through the veil, which is his flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and we have the High Priest over the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Let us, therefore, draw near with a confirmed heart, and the full security of faith, with our hearts sprinkled and cleansed from an evil conscience, and our body washed with pure waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and let us persevere in the confession of our hope, and not swerve; for faithful is He who hath promised us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And let us consider one another with incitement to charity and good works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And let us not forsake our congregation, as is the custom with some; but pray one with another; (and) so much the more as ye see that day to be approaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For if with his will any man shall sin after he hath received the knowledge of the truth, there is not still a victim to be offered for sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but a fearful judgment to come, and burning fire which devoureth the adversaries.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For if he who transgressed the law of Musha, upon the mouth of two or three witnesses, without mercy died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>how much greater punishment, think ye, shall he receive who hath trampled upon the Son of Aloha, and hath counted the blood of the covenant of him by which he had been sanctified as that of every man and hath insulted the Spirit of grace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>We know him who hath said, Retribution is mine, and I will repay: and again, The Lord shall judge his people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>How terrible to fall into the hands of Aloha the Living!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Be mindful, therefore, of the first days, those in which ye received baptism; and when ye sustained a great agony of sufferings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>with ignominy and affliction; and when ye were made gazing-stocks, and were associated with men who also endured these (things).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And it afflicted you on account of them who were bound; and the pillage of your goods with joy ye sustained, as knowing that ye have a possession in heaven, which is better, and passeth not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Destroy not, therefore, the confidence which you have, for which there is a great reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But patience is needed by you, that ye may do the will of Aloha, and receive the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Because (yet) a little time, and a very little, and He who cometh shall come, and not be slow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But the just by the faith of me shall live; but if he become weary, my soul delighteth not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But we are not of the weariness which bringeth to perdition, but of the faith which maketh us to possess our soul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
