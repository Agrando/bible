And he (it was who) met Abraham when he returned from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And to him Abraham separated the tenth from every thing which he had with him. Now his name, being expounded, (is,) the King of Righteousness; and again, MalekSholem, which is, King of peace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>whose father and mother were not written in the genealogies; neither the beginning of his days, nor the conclusion of his life; but in the likeness (of that) of THE SON OF ALOHA standeth his priesthood for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But see how great this (person was,) that Abraham, head of the fathers, gave to him the tenths and the choicest things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For they of the sons of Levi who have received the priesthood, have a commandment of the law to receive tenths from the people, they from their brethren, they also from the loins of Abraham having sprung.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he who is not written in their genealogies took tithes from ABRAHAM, and blessed him who had received the promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But, without controversy, he who is less is blessed by one who is Greater than himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And here the sons of men who die receive the tithes; but there he concerning whom the scripture testifieth that he liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as one may say, by the hand of Abraham, even Levi, he who taketh tithes, himself also is tithed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he was yet in the loins of his father when he met Malki-Zedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If, therefore, Perfection were to be through the priesthood of the Levoyee, by which the law has been put upon the people, why was there another Priest required, who should arise in the resemblance of Malki-Zedek? For he had said, In the likeness of Aharun he shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But as a change hath been made in the priesthood, so is there also a change made in the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For he concerning whom these things are said was born from another tribe, from which no man hath ministered at the altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is manifest that from Jihuda arose our Lord, from the tribe of whom Musha hath said nothing concerning priesthood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And again: it is more fully known by that which hath said, In the likeness of MalkiZedek ariseth another Priest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who was made not by the law of bodily commandments, but in the power of a life which is indissoluble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he testifieth concerning him, Thou art a Priest for evermore according to the likeness of Malki-Zedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the change which was made in the first institution was on account of its powerlessness, and because profit was not in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the law perfected nothing: but instead of it a hope has entered which is more excellent, (and) by which we are brought nigh unto Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he hath confirmed it unto us in an oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For they were made priests without an oath; but this with an oath: as he said unto him by the hand of David, The Lord hath sworn and will not lie, that thou art the Priest for ever in the likeness of Malki-Zedek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this more excellent is the covenant of (which) Jeshu is the sponsor .</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>There were (moreover) many priests, because they were dying, and were not permitted to remain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But because this (one) standeth for ever, his priesthood passeth not away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he is able to save for eternity them who approach by him unto Aloha; for he liveth through all time, and offereth up prayers on their behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For such an High Priest as this was adequate for us; pure, and without evil, and without spot; who was separate from sins, and exalted higher than heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>With him there was no necessity daily, like the chief of the priests, that first for his own sins he should offer sacrifices, and then on behalf of the people: for this he did once when in himself he offered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the law constituted infirm men priests; but the word of the oath, which was subsequent to the law, (hath constituted) THE SON perfect for evermore.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
