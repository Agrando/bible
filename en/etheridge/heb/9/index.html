But time there is not to speak upon every one of these which were thus ordained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now, into the outer sanctuary at all times entered the priests, and fulfilled their offices;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>but into the tabernacle which was within, one day in the year, alone, entered the high priest, with that blood which he offered for himself and the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By this the Spirit of Holiness made known that the way of the holies was not yet manifested, so long as was the standing of the first tabernacle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And this was a figurative representation for the time in which oblations and victims have been offered;-those which have not been able to perfect the consciousness of him who offered them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but (have consisted) in meat and drink only, and in various kinds of baptism, being institutions of the flesh appointed until the time of setting right.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the Meshiha who hath come was a High Priest of good things which he wrought out, and hath entered into the great and perfect tabernacle (which was) not made with hands, nor made from these creatures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Nor entered he with the blood of goats and calves, but with the blood of himself he entered once the holy place, and hath found eternal redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if the blood of goats and of calves, and the dust of an heifer, sprinkled upon those who were unclean, sanctifieth them for the purification of their flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>how much more then shall the blood of the Meshiha, who, by the Eternal Spirit, himself hath offered without spot unto Aloha, purify our conscience from dead works, to serve the Aloha the Living?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this was he made the Mediator of the new covenant, that by his death he might become the ransom for those who had transgressed against the first covenant, (and) that they might receive the promise, they, who are called unto the inheritance which is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where a covenant is, there is indicated the DEATH of that which made it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For upon death only is it confirmed; because while he who made it lived there is no value in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Wherefore neither the first without blood was confirmed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For when every precept had been enjoined by Musha to the whole people according to the law, Musha took the blood of the heifer, and water, with the scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled upon the books and upon all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and said to them, This is the blood of that covenant which is commanded by Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Also upon the tabernacle and upon all the vessels of the service from it with blood he sprinkled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because every thing with blood was purified under the law; and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For it was necessary that these which are a type of the heavenlies, with (these) things should be purified; but the heavenlies themselves with sacrifices that are more excellent than they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For not into the sanctuary made with hands hath the Meshiha entered, which is an emblem of the true one, but into heaven itself hath he entered, that he might appear before the face of Aloha for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nor that he should offer himself many times, as did the chief of the priests, entering every year into the holy place with blood not his own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>otherwise he would have been obligated many times to suffer from the beginning of the world. But now, in the end of the world, once hath he offered himself, that by his sacrifice he might abolish sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as it is ordained to the sons of men, that they must once die, and after their death the judgment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so also the Meshiha was once offered, and in his (own) person sacrificed (for) the sins of many; but the second time without sins he appeareth for the salvation of them who expect him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
