As the sons of light, then, so walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the fruits of the light are in all goodness and rectitude and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And be discerning of that which is good before our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And have no communion with the works of darkness, which have no fruits, but reprove them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For that which in secrecy they do it is execrable even to mention.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For every thing is exposed by the light, and is revealed, and whatever revealeth is light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Wherefore it is said, Awake thou who sleepest, And arise from the dead, And the Meshiha shall enlighten thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See then that you walk vigilantly, not as fools,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but as the wise who redeem their opportunity, because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>On account of this, be not wanting in mind, but understand what is the will of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And be not drunk with wine, in which is intemperance, but be filled with the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And discourse with yourselves with psalms and with hymns and with songs of the Spirit, singing with your hearts unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And give thanks always on behalf of every man in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha unto Aloha the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And be subject one to another in the love of the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>WIVES, be subject to your husbands as to our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the husband is the head of the wife, as the Meshiha is the head of the church, and he himself is the Saviour of the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But as the church is subject to Meshiha, so also (should) wives be unto their husbands in every thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, as also the Meshiha loved his church, and gave himself for her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>that he might sanctify her and purify her in the laver of waters and by the word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and that he might constitute her a church unto himself, being glorified, and not having blemish or wrinkle or any thing like these; but to be holy and spotless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So it becometh husbands to love their wives, as their own bodies. For he who his wife loveth, himself he loveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no man ever hated his own body, but nourisheth it, and taketh care of it; so also the Meshiha (taketh care) of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For we are members of his body, and of his flesh are we, and of his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Because of this a man leaveth his father and his mother, and cleaveth unto his wife, and they two become one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This mystery is great; but I speak of the Meshiha and of his church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless let every one of you so love his wife as his own self; but let the wife reverence her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
