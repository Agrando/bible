and be patient towards one another in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And be diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>that you may be in one body and in one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For one is the Lord, and one the faith, and one the baptism;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and one is Aloha, the Father of all, and over all, and by all, and in us all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But unto each of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Wherefore it is said, He ascended on high;
