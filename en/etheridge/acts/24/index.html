And Paulos answered, and said, For many years I know that thou hast been the judge of this people, and on this account I joyfully make defence for myself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>while thou shouldst know that it hath not been more than twelve days since I went up to Urishlem to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Neither found they me speaking with any man in the temple, neither have I gathered an assembly in their synagogue nor in the city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>nor is it in their power to demonstrate before thee any thing of what they accuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nevertheless, this do I confess, that in that very doctrine of which they speak, in it serve I the God of my fathers, believing in all that is written in the law and in the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and having hope in Aloha that which they also hope: that there shall be a resurrection from the house of the dead, of the just and of the evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because of this also I labour to have a good conscience before Aloha and before men, continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But after many years I came to the sons of my people to bestow alms, and to present an oblation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these found me in the temple being purified, not with a concourse nor with tumult; but men Jihudoyee who had come from Asia raised a tumult;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>(and) these it behoved to stand with me before thee, and to accuse of that whatever they have (against me).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Or let these themselves declare, what crime they found in me, when I stood before their assembly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>unless for this one word which I proclaimed while standing in the midst of them, For the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Felix, because he knew this way fully, delayed them, saying, When the tribune comes I will hear between you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he commanded the centurion to keep Paulos in quietude, and that none of his acquaintances should be hindered from ministering to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after a few days Felix, and Drusilla his wife, who was a Jihudoytha, sent and called Paulos, and they heard from him concerning the faith of the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as he discoursed with them of righteousness, and of holiness, and of the judgment which is to come, Felix was filled with fear, and he said, Now go, and when I have opportunity I will send for thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For he hoped that a bribe would be given him by Paulos, and on this account he continually sent to bring him, and to speak with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when two years were fulfilled to him, another governor came in his place, who was called Porcios Festos. But Felix, as to do a favour to the Jihudoyee, left Paulos bound.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
