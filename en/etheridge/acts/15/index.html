And they recounted to them how much Aloha had done with them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>but (that) certain had arisen who had believed from the doctrine of the Pharishee, and said, It behoved you to circumcise them, and require them to keep the law of Musha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the apostles and presbyters assembled to consider this doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when there had been much investigation, Shemun arose, and said to them, Men, brethren, you know that from the first days from my mouth did Aloha choose that the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Aloha, who knoweth what is in the hearts, testified of them, and gave them the Spirit of Holiness, as to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And nothing distinguished between us and them, because he had purified by faith their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now why tempt you Aloha, that you would lay a yoke upon the necks of the disciples, which nor our fathers nor we could bear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But by the grace of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, we believe that we shall be saved, as they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And all the assembly were silent. And they listened to Paulos and Bar Naba, who related how Aloha had done by their hands signs and mighty works among the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>AND after they were silent, Jakub arose, and said, Men, brethren, hear me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Shemun hath related to you how Aloha hath begun to elect from the Gentiles a people to his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And with this accord the words of the prophets; as when it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After these I will return, And raise the dwelling of David which hath fallen; And I will build that which hath fallen from it, And will raise it up:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>That the residue of men may seek the Lord, And all the Gentiles, on whom my name is called,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Saith the Lord, who doeth all these. Known from eternity are the works of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>On this account I say, that we should not molest those who from the Gentiles have been converted unto Aloha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but that we send to them, that they shall separate from the uncleanness of (idol) sacrifice, and from fornication, and from the strangled, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Musha from former generations in all cities hath had preachers in the synagogues who on all shabaths read him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the apostles and presbyters, with all the church, elected men from them, and sent to Antiokia with Paulos and Bar Naba Jihuda, who was called Bar Shaba, and Shilo, men who were chief among the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>AND they wrote an epistle by their hands, thus: The apostles and presbyters and brethren, to those who are in Antiokia and in Syria and in Cilicia, the brethren who are of the Gentiles; peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>It hath been heard by us, that men from us have gone forth and disturbed you with words, and have subverted your souls by saying, that you should be circumcised and observe the law, whom we have not commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>On account of this we have deliberated, all being assembled, and have chosen men and sent them to you, with Paulos and Bar Naba, our beloved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men who have delivered their lives for the sake of the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And we have sent with them Jihuda and Shilo, that by word they may tell you the same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it hath been the will of the Spirit of Holiness, and also of us, not to lay upon you greater burden beyond these things which are constraining;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that you abstain from that which hath been sacrificed (to idols), and from blood, and from that which is strangled, and from fornication; and while you keep yourselves from these, you will be well. Be confirmed in our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now they who were sent came to Antiokia, and they assembled all the people and gave the epistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had read, they rejoiced and were comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And by the word the brethren were the more strengthened, and Jihuda and Shilo established them because they were prophets also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they had been there a time, the brethren dismissed them with peace unto the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>BUT Paulos and Bar Naba remained in Antiokia, and taught and preached, with many others, the word of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And after (certain) days Paulos said to Bar Naba, Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we have preached the word of Aloha, and see what they do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But Bar Naba willed to take Juhanon, he who is surnamed Markos.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paulos willed not to take him with them, because he had forsaken them when they were in Pamphylia, and had not come with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>On account of this contention they separated one from the other; and Bar Naba took Markos, and they went by sea and came to Cypros.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paulos chose for him Shilo, and went forth commended by the brethren to the grace of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches. And he came to Derbe the city, and to Lystra.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
