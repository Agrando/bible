And there went also with me these six brethren, and we entered into the man's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he related to us how he had seen in his house an angel, who stood and said to him, Send to the city Joppa, and bring Shemun who is called Kipha,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he will speak with thee words by which thou wilt be saved, thou and all thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when I proceeded to speak there, the Spirit of Holiness overshadowed them, as upon us from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I remembered the word of our Lord, who said, Juhanon baptized you with waters, but you shall be baptized with the Spirit of Holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If then Aloha equally hath given the gift to the Gentiles who have believed in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha as we, who was I, that I should be sufficient to prohibit Aloha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when these words they had heard they were silent, and they praised Aloha, and said, Now also unto the Gentiles Aloha hath given repentance unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>BUT they who had been dispersed by the tribulation that was concerning Estephanos went unto Punika, also to the region of Kypros and to Antiokia, but with any one not speaking the word unless only with the Jihudoyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But of them were men of Kypros and of Kyrine; these entered into Antiokia, and discoursed with the Javnoyee, and evangelized concerning our Lord Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and many believed, and were converted unto the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And this was heard by the ears of the sons of the church which was at Urishlem, and they sent Bar Naba to Antiokia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he came thither, and beheld the grace of Aloha, he rejoiced, and entreated them with all their heart to cleave to our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man, and full of the Spirit of Holiness and of faith, and there was added much people to our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he went forth to Tarsos to seek for Shaol;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and when he had found him he brought him with him to Antiokia. And a whole year together they assembled in the church, and taught much people: from thence first in Antiokia the disciples were called Christianee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in those days there came from Urishlem thither prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of them arose whose name was Agabos: and he made known to them by the Spirit that a great famine would be in all the land. And that famine was in the days of Claudios Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore the disciples, according as each of them had, determined to send for the service of those brethren who dwelt in Jihud;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and they sent by the hand of Bar Naba and Shaol to the presbyters who were there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
