It is hard to thee to kick against the pricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He answered and said, Who art thou, my Lord? And our Lord said, I am Jeshu Natsroya, whom thou persecutest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>but arise, go into Darmsuk, and there it will be spoken with thee concerning what thou must do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the men who went with him in the way stood astonished, because the voice alone they heard, but a man was not seen by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Shaol arose from the earth, and could not see any thing when his eyes were opened. And they took him by his hand and brought him into Darmsuk;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and he saw not for three days, neither did he eat or drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But there was in Darmsuk a certain disciple whose name was Hanania. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Hanania. And he said, Behold me, my Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And our Lord said to him, Arise, go to the street which is called the Straight, and inquire in the house of Jihuda for Shaol, who is from Tarsos the city. For, behold, while praying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>he hath seen in a vision a man whose name is Hanania, who entered and laid upon him the hand that his eyes might be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Hanania said, My Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man, of how much evil he hath brought upon thy saints in Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And behold, here also he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all those who invoke thy name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Lord said to him, Arise, go; for a vessel is he to me, chosen to bear my name to the nations, and to kings, and to the house of the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will show him what he is to suffer on account of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Hanania went to the house unto him, and he laid upon him the hand, and said to him, Shaol, my brother, our Lord Jeshu hath sent me; He who appeared to thee in the way while thou wast coming, that thine eyes may be opened, and thou mayest be filled with the Spirit of Holiness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And instantly there fell from his eyes something which was like to scales; and his eyes were opened, and, arising, he was baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he took food and was strengthened,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and was (certain) days with those disciples who were in Darmsuk. And at once he preached in the synagogues of the Jihudoyee concerning Jeshu, that he is the Son of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all they who heard him wondered, and they said, Is not this he who persecuted all those who call upon this name in Urishlem? And behold, also, hither upon the self-same (object) was he sent to bind and take them to the chief priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>BUT Shaol was the more strengthened, and moved those Jihudoyee who dwelt at Darmsuk, while he showed that this is the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when days were many to him there, the Jihudoyee wrought treachery against him to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But their treachery was showed to Shaol, which they sought to do to him; and that they kept the gates of the city day and night to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the disciples set him in a pannier, and dismissed him from the wall by night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he went to Urishlem, and willed to be attached to the disciples. And all of them were afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Bar Naba took him and brought him to the apostles, and recounted to them how in the way he had seen the Lord, and what he had spoken with him; and how in Darmsuk with boldness he had spoken in the name of Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he went in with them and went out in Urishlem. And he spake in the name of Jeshu with boldness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and disputed with those Jihudoyee who knew Greek; but they were wishful to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when the brethren knew, they brought him by night to Cesarea, and from thence sent him to Tarsos.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Nevertheless, in the church which was in Jihud, and in Galila, and Shomreen, there was peace, while (it) was edified; and going forward in the fear of Aloha, and in the consolation of the Spirit of Holiness, was multiplied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And it was that while Shemun itinerated among the cities, he went down also to the saints who dwelt in Lud the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he found a certain man whose name was Ania, who had lain upon a bed paralyzed eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Shemun said to him, Ania, Jeshu Meshiha healeth thee; arise, and make thy bed. And instantly he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all who dwelt in Lud and in Sarona saw him, and turned to Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>BUT there was a certain disciple in Joppa the city, whose name was Tabitha. This was rich in good works and in alms which she had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But she became afflicted in those days, and died. And they washed her and laid her in an upper room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the disciples heard that Shemun was in Lud the city, because it is over against Joppa, and they sent to him two men, who should pray of him not to delay to come among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Shemun arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him up to the upper room, and assembled (and) stood around him all the widows, weeping, and showing him those vestments and mantles which Tabitha had given them, while living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Shemun put forth all the men without, and fell upon his knees and prayed; and he turned towards the corpse and said Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and when she beheld Shemun, she sat. And he reached his hand and raised her, and called the saints and widows, and gave her to them living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And this was known to all the city, and many believed in our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he was in Joppa days not a few, sojourning in the house of Shemun the tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
