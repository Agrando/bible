But we were in that city certain days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And we went out on the day of shabath without the gate of the city to the bank of the river, because there was seen a house of prayer; and sitting down we discoursed with the women who assembled there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And a certain female, a seller of purple, who feared Aloha, her name was Lydia, of Theatira the city, (was there,) whose heart our Lord opened, and she heard that which Paulos spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And she was baptized, she and the sons of her house. And she besought us and said, If it be that you truly think that I have believed in our Lord, come, remain in my house; and she constrained us much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>AND it was while we went to the house of prayer, a certain damsel met us in whom was a spirit of divination, and she had produced her lords much gain by her divination.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And she came after Paulos and after us, and cried and said, These men are the servants of Aloha the Most High, and announce to us the way of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this she did many days. And Paulos was indignant, and said to that spirit, I command thee in the name of Jeshu Meshiha to come out of her. And in that hour it came out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when her lords saw that the hope of their gain had gone from her, they laid hold on Paulos and Shilo and drew them to the public place, and brought them unto the prefects and to the chiefs of the city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and said, These men are troubling our city, because they are Jihudoyee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and are preaching to us those rites which it is not permitted us to receive and perform, because we are Rumoyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And a great gathering assembled against them. Then the prefects rent their vestments, and commanded to scourge them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had scourged them much, they cast them into the house of the bound, and commanded the keeper of the house of the bound to keep them watchfully.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he, having received this command, brought in and shut them in the inner house of the house of the bound, and fastened their feet in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in the dividing of the night, Paulos and Shilo prayed and glorified Aloha, and the chained-ones heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And suddenly there was a great trembling, and the foundations of the house of the bound trembled, and at once the doors of all were opened, and the chains of all were loosened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when the keeper of the house of the bound awoke, and saw that the doors of the house of the bound were open, he took a sword and sought to kill himself, because he thought that the chained-ones had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Paulos cried with a high voice and said to him, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he kindled for himself a lamp, and sprang, and came, perturbed, and fell at the feet of Paulos and of Shilo:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and he brought them without, and said to them, My lords, what behoveth me to do that I may be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they said to him, Believe in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spoke with him the words of the Lord, and with all the sons of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the same hour of that night, he took and washed them from their stripes, and was forthwith baptized, and all the sons of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he took and brought them up into his house, and set for them the table, and exulted, he and the sons of his house, in the faith of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when it was morning the prefects sent to the bearers of rods to say to the chief of the house of the bound, Loose those men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>AND when the chief of the house of the bound heard, he entered and spoke that word to Paulos, that the prefects have sent that you might he dismissed; and now go forth (and) proceed in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Paulos saith to him, They scourged us in the eyes of the world, (we) being innocent, (and) Roman men, and threw us into the house of the bound; and now would they bring us forth secretly? No, indeed, but they shall come and bring us out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the bearers of rods went and told the prefects these words which had been spoken to them. And when they heard that they were Rumoyee, they feared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they came to them, and besought them to come forth and depart from the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when they had gone forth from the house of the bound, they entered with Lydia, and there saw the brethren, and consoled them. And they went forth</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
