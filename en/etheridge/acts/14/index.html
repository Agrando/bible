And when Paulos saw him, and knew that there was faith in him to be saved,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>he said to him with a high voice, To thee I say, in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, Stand upon thy feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And leaping, he stood and walked. And the assembly of the people, when they saw what Paulos had done, lifted up their voice in the language of the country, and said, Gods in the likeness of men have come down unto us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they named Bar Naba, lord of the gods; and Paulos, Hermis, because he was foremost in discourse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the priest of the lord of the gods, who was without the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates of the court of the place where they dwelt, and willed to sacrifice to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Bar Naba and Paulos, when they heard, rent their garments, and sprang up, and came out to the crowd. And they cried,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said, Men, what do you? We also are children of men liable to sufferings like you, (and) who preach to you that from these vanities you should turn unto Aloha the living, who made heaven and earth, and the seas, and all that is in them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who in former generations left all nations to walk in ways of their own;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>yet leaving not himself without witness, while he did them good from heaven, and sent down rain, and multiplied the fruits in their times, and filled with food and gladness their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when these they had said, they scarcely restrained the people that some one should not sacrifice to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But there came thither Jihudoyee from Ikanon and from Antiokia, and stirred up against them the people; and they stoned Paulos, and dragged him out of the city, because they thought that he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the disciples gathered to him, and, arising, he entered the city. AND the day after he went forth from thence with Bar Naba, and came to Derbe the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had preached to the sons of the city, they discipled many. And they returned and came to Lystra the city, and to Ikanon, and to Antiokia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to persevere in the faith. And they said to them, that through much tribulation it behoveth to enter the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they constituted for them in all the churches presbyters, having fasted with them and prayed, and commended them to our Lord in whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they had gone through the country of Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and when they had preached in the city Perga the word of the Lord, they went down to Atalia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and from thence voyaged by sea and came to Antiokia, because from thence they had been commended to the grace of the Lord for the work which they had accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when all the church had convened, they recounted every thing which Aloha had done with them, and that he had opened the door of the faith unto the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And much time were they there with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
