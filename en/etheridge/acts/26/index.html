Then Paulos stretched forth his hand and made defence, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Of all that I am accused by the Jihudoyee, king Agripos, I consider myself happy, that before you I (have to) make defence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Especially because I know that you are conversant with all questions and laws of the Jihudoyee; therefore, I pray you with patient mind to hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For the Jihudoyee themselves-if they would testify-know my manners from my youth, which were mine from the beginning among my people at Urishlem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because they of a long time were assured of me, and they know that in the high doctrine of the Pharishee I lived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now, concerning the hope of the promise that was made to our fathers by Aloha, stand I, and am judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And for this hope (to which) our twelve tribes, with diligent prayers by day and night, are expecting to come, for this very hope am I accused by the Jihudoyee, king Agripos!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>What judge you; ought we not to believe that Aloha will raise the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For I, at the first, proposed in my mind to do many things against the name of Jeshu Natsroya.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This I also did in Urishlem. And many holy ones I cast into the house of the bound, by the authority which I had received from the great priests; and when they were killed by them, I participated with those who condemned them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And in every synagogue I was furious against them, while I constrained them to blaspheme the name of Jeshu; and, being filled with great wrath against them, I went forth unto other cities also to persecute them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And while going on this account to Darmsuk, with authority and permission from the great priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>at the dividing of the day, in the way, I saw from heaven, O king, shining upon me and upon all who were with me, a light which (was) more excellent than the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we fell all of us upon the earth; and I heard a voice that said to me in Hebrew, Shaol, Shaol, why persecutest thou me? It is hard to thee to kick against the pricks!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I said, Who art thou, my Lord? And he said, I am Jeshu Natsroya, whom thou persecutest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he said to me, Stand upon thy feet, because for this I have appeared to thee, to appoint thee a minister and witness of that (for) which thou hast seen me, and (for) which thou shalt see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I will deliver thee from the people of the Jihudoyee, and from the other nations to whom I send thee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto Aloha, and receive the forgiveness of sins, and a lot with the saints through faith, which (is) in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore, king Agripos, I withstood not with perversity the heavenly vision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but preached, at first to them who were in Darmsuk, and to them who were at Urishlem, and in all the districts of Jihud, and also to the Gentiles have I preached, that they should repent, and turn to Aloha, and do works worthy of repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And for these things the Jihudoyee seized me in the temple, and would have killed me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but Aloha hath helped me until this day; and, behold, I stand and testify to the small and to the great, yet nothing beyond Musha and the prophets do I speak, but those things which they said should come to pass;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the Meshiha should suffer, and should be the chief of the resurrection from the house of the dead, and should preach light to the people and to the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>AND as Paulos was thus making defence, Festos cried with a high voice, Thou art mad, Paulos; much learning hath made thee mad!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Paulos said to him, I am not mad, victorious Festos, but words of truth and righteousness I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And king Agripos also, especially, knoweth concerning these things; and therefore speak I with openness before him; because not one of these things I think have been hidden from him; for they were not done in secrecy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Believest thou, king Agripos, the prophets? I know that thou believest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>King Agripos said to him, (Within) a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paulos said, I would from Aloha that in little and in much, not only thou, but also all who hear me to-day, were as I am, except these bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the king arose, and the governor, and Bernike, and those who sat with them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and when they were removed thence they spake one with another, and said, Nothing that is worthy of death or of bonds hath this man done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Agripos said to Festos, This man could have been dismissed, if he had not called the appeal of Caesar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
