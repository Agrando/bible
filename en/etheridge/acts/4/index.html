For, behold, a conspicuous sign which hath been done by their hands to all the inhabitants of Urishlem is known, and we cannot deny.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But that this report may not go forth more, we will threaten them that again they shall not speak in This Name to any man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called them, and commanded them that not at all they should speak and teach in the name of Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>SHEMUN KIPHA and Juhanon answered and said to them, If it be right before Aloha that you we obey rather than Aloha, judge you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For what we have seen and heard we cannot but speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they threatened them, and dismissed them; for they could not find cause to lay upon their head, because of the people; for every one glorified Aloha for that which had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For a son of more than forty years was that man in whom had been wrought this sign of healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they were dismissed they came to their brethren, and made known to them whatever the priests and elders had said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they, when they had heard, with one accord lifted up their voice unto Aloha, and said, Lord, thou art God who hast made heaven and earth and the seas, and all that is in them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And thou art he who hast spoken by the Spirit of Holiness in the mouth of David thy servant: Why rage the Heathen, And the peoples imagine vanity?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings and powers of the earth arise And counsel together against the Lord, And against his Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For verily they are assembled in this city against thy holy Son Jeshu, whom thou hast anointed,-Herodes and Pilatos with the Gentiles and the synagogue of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to work whatsoever thy hand and thy will have signified before should be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now also, Lord, behold and see their threatenings, and give unto thy servants with boldness to preach thy word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>while thy hand thou outstretchest unto healings and mighty works which they shall do in the name of thy holy Son Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they prayed and supplicated, the place in which they were assembled was moved, and they were all filled with the Spirit of Holiness, and they spake with openness the word of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>BUT to the assembly of the men who believed there was one soul and one mind; and no man of them said of the goods which he possessed that they were his own, but all whatever they had was in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power did those apostles testify concerning the resurrection of Jeshu Meshiha, and great grace was with all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And no man of them had want; for they who possessed fields and houses sold, and brought the prices of whatever was sold</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and laid at the feet of the apostles, and there was given to each according to that which was needed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But Jauseph, who was entitled Bar Naba by the apostles, which is interpreted, A son of consolation, a Levoya from the Isle of Kypros,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>had a field, and he sold it, and brought its price and laid before the feet of the apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
