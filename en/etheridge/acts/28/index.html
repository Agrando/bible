And they kindled a fire, and called all of us to warm, because there was great rain and cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Paulos took many sticks and placed upon the fire; and there came forth a viper from the heat of the fire, and bit (him) in his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when the Barbaroyee saw it hang upon his hand, they said, Perhaps this man is a murderer, whom, though he is escaped from the sea, justice suffereth not to live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Paulos shook his hand, and cast the viper into the fire, and nothing of evil befell him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the Barbaroyee expected that he would immediately have swelled and fallen dead upon the ground; and when they had for a great while expected and saw that nothing of evil befell him, they changed their words, and said he was a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But there were possessions in that place (belonging) to a certain man whose name was Publios, who himself was the chief of the island; and he cheerfully received us into his house three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the father of Publios was ill in a fever, and a disease of the bowels. And Paulos went in to him, and prayed and laid his hand on him, and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when this was done, the rest also of them who were diseased in the island came to him and were cured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And with great honours they honoured us; and when we went forth from thence they supplied us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But we went forth after three months and voyaged in an Alexandrine ship which had wintered at the island; and she had upon her the sign of the Twins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And we came to Sarakosa the city, and remained there three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And from thence we went round and came to Regium the city. And after one day the south wind blew, and in two days we came to Putialos, a city of Italia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we found there brethren, and they prayed of us, and we were with them seven days, and then went we unto Ruma.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the brethren who were there heard, they came forth to meet us unto the street that is called Apios Foros, and unto the Three Taverns. And when Paulos saw them he thanked Aloha, and was strengthened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we entered Ruma. And the centurion allowed Paulos to sojourn where he willed, with the soldier, him who guarded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And after three days Paulos sent to convoke the principal men of the Jihudoyee; and when they were assembled, he said to them, Men, brethren, I, who in nothing have risen against the people, nor the law of our fathers, in bonds was delivered from Urishlem into the hands of the Rumoyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they who examined me willed to dismiss me, because they found not in me any fault worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when the Jihudoyee had risen against me, I was constrained to call the appeal of Caesar; (yet) not as though I had in any thing to be the accuser of the sons of my people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherefore I have besought you to come, that I might see you, and declare to you these things; for on account of the hope of Israel am I bound with this chain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said to him, We have not received letters concerning thee from Jihud, and none of the brethren who have come from Urishlem have spoken any thing evil of thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we are willing to hear from thee what it is that thou thinkest; for we know that this doctrine is by no man received.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>AND they appointed him a day; and many assembled and came where he sojourned; and he explained to them concerning the kingdom of Aloha, testifying and persuading them concerning Jeshu, from the law of Musha and from the prophets, from the morning until the evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some of them were persuaded by his words, and others were not persuaded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they removed from him, while not agreeing together. And Paulos said to them this word, Well spake the Spirit of Holiness, by the mouth of Eshaia the prophet, against your fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>saying, Go unto this people, and say unto them, Hearing, you will hear and will not understand. And you will see, but not discern:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For stupified is the heart of this people, And their hearing they have made heavy, And their eyes have they closed, Lest they should see with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their hearts, And be turned unto me, and I should forgive them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Be this therefore known to you, that to the Gentiles is sent this redemption, for they will also hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paulos hired his own house, and was in it two years, and received there all those who came to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he preached concerning the kingdom of Aloha, and taught with confidence concerning our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, none forbidding.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
