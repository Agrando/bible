Jihudoyee, from all the peoples who are under heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when that voice was made, the whole people assembled and were perturbed, because every man of them heard as they spoke in their (several) tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>(And) they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another, These all who speak, behold, are they not Galiloyee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>How hear we (then) each in his own tongue in which we were born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Parthoyee and Medoyee and Alanoyee, and they who dwell in the Place of Rivers, Jihudoyee and Kapadukoyee, and of the region of Pontos and of Asia;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and from the land of Phrygia and of Pamphylia and of Metsreen, and the regions of Lybi neighbouring upon Kyrine, and those who come from Rumi, Jihudoyee, and Proselytes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and from Krete and Arabia, behold, we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonders of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But all of them were amazed and admired, saying one to another, Of whom is this thing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But others mocked them, saying, These have drunk new wine, and are inebriate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And afterwards arose Shemun Kipha with the eleven apostles, and lifted up his voice and said to them: Men, Jihudoyee, and all who dwell at Urishlem, be this known to you, and hearken to my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For not as you suppose are these drunken; for, behold, until now are three hours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But this is that spoken of by Joel the prophet:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It shall be in the last days, saith Aloha, I will pour my Spirit upon all flesh: And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, And your youths shall see visions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And your elders shall dream dreams: And upon the servants and upon the handmaids Will I pour my Spirit in those days; And they shall prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give signs in heaven, And mighty (deeds) on earth; Blood and fire and clouds of smoke:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness, And the moon into blood, Before shall come the day of the Lord, great and fearful;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And every one who shall call the name Of the Lord shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>MEN, sons of Israel, hear these words; Jeshu Natsroya, the man who from Aloha appeared with you, with powers and mighty acts, which Aloha wrought among you by his hand, (even) as you know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>This, who was separated thereunto by the foreknowledge and by the will of Aloha, you delivered into the hands of the wicked, and crucified and slew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Aloha raised him, and loosed the bands of Shiul, because it was not possible that he should be holden in Shiul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David said concerning him, I have foreseen my Lord at all time, Who is at my right hand that I should not be moved;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Wherefore my heart is glad, And my glory rejoiceth: And also my body shall sojourn in hope;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thou wilt not leave my soul in Shiul, Nor give thy Saint to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thou wilt reveal to me the way of life, Thou wilt fill me with joy with thy presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Men, brethren, suffer me to speak openly with you concerning the chief-father David, that he is dead and also buried, and his sepulchre is with us till this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For he was a prophet, and knew that the oath Aloha had sworn to him, Of the fruit of thy loins I will cause to sit upon thy throne:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he foresaw and spake concerning, the resurrection of the Meshiha, that He would not be left in Shiul, nor would his body see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jeshu hath Aloha raised, and we all are his witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he it is who at the right hand of Aloha is exalted, and hath received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, and hath shed forth this gift, which, behold, you see and you hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David hath not ascended into heaven, because he himself hath said, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Until I place thine adversaries the stool of thy feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Assuredly, then, let all the house of Israel know, that Lord and Meshiha hath Aloha made this Jeshu, whom you crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>AND when they heard, they were pierced in their heart, and said to Shemun and to the rest of the apostles, What shall we do, brethren?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Shemun saith to them, Repent, and be baptized, every man of you, in the name of the Lord Jeshu, for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all them who are afar off, whom Aloha himself shall call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words he testified to them and entreated of them, saying, Save (yourselves) from this perverse generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And some of them eagerly received his word and believed and were baptized, and there were added in that day as three thousand souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they were faithful in the doctrine of the apostles, and participated in prayer and in the breaking of the eucharist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And solemnity was on every soul; and many signs and mighty acts were done by the hand of the apostles in Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all those who believed were together, and every thing they had was in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they who had property sold it, and divided to each according to that which he needed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And every day they continued in the temple with one soul, and in the house they brake the bread, and took their food rejoicing and in the cleanness of their hearts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising Aloha, (and) given (to be) in favour before all the people. And our Lord added daily them who were saved into the church.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
