this Jeshu who is taken up from you into the heavens will so come as you have seen him ascend into the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And afterward they returned to Urishlem from the mount which is called the place of Olives, which is over against Urishlem, and distant from her as seven stadias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after they had entered, they ascended to that upper room in which were Petros, and Juhanon, and Jakub, and Andros, and Philipos, and Thoma, and Mathai, and Bar Tolmai, and Jakub bar Halphai, and Shemun the Zealous, and Jihuda bar Jakub.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These altogether persevered in prayer with one soul, with the women, and with Mariam the mother of Jeshu, and with his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>AND in those days arose Shemun Kipha in the midst of the disciples;-now there was there an assembly of men as an hundred and twenty;-and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men, brethren, it was right for that scripture to be fulfilled which the Spirit of Holiness had before spoken, by the mouth of David, concerning Jihuda, who was the leader of them who took Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For he had numbered with us, and had part in this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This is he who obtained the field with the wages of sin, and fell upon his face on the ground, and was severed in his middle, and all his bowels were shed forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this hath been known of all who dwell in Urishlem; and so is called that field in the language of the country Hakel-damo, the interpretation of which is, A field of blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his habitation be desert, And no inhabitant be therein, And his ministry let another take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>There needeth therefore one from these men who have been with us in all this time in which our Lord Jeshu hath come in and gone out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>which went forth from the baptism of Juhanon until the day that he was taken up from (being) with us, to be with us a witness of his resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they set up two: Jauseph, who is called Barshaba, who is surnamed Justus, and Mathia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And praying, they said, Thou, Lord, (who) knowest the hearts of all, show the one whom thou choosest of these two,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that he may receive the part in the ministry and the apostleship from which Jihuda separated, to go unto his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they cast the lots, and it came up unto Mathia; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
