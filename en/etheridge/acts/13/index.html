And the proconsul called Shaol and Bar Naba and requested to hear from them the word of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But this sorcerer, Bar Shuma, whose name interpreted is Elymos, stood against them, because he desired to avert the proconsul from faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Shaol, he who is called PAULOS, was filled with the Spirit of Holiness, and beheld him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said, O full of all deceits and all wickednesses, thou son of the devil, and adversary of all righteousness, ceasest thou not to pervert the right ways of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, and not see the sun until the time. And in the hour there fell upon him obscurity and darkness, and he went about asking some one to hold him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when the proconsul saw what had been done, he wondered, and believed in the doctrine of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>BUT Paulos and Bar Naba went on by sea from the City Paphos, and came to Perga, a city of Pamphylia; and Juhanon separated from them, and went to Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But they went forth from Perga, and came to Antiokia, the city of Pisidia. And they entered the synagogue, and sat on the day of shabath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after the law and the prophets had been read, the presbyters of the synagogue sent to them, and said, Men, brethren, have you a word of exhortation to say to the people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Paulos arose, and signed with his hand, and said to them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Men, sons of Israel, and those who fear Aloha, hearken! The God of this people elected our fathers, and exalted and magnified them, when they were sojourners in the land of Metsreen, and with uplifted arm brought them out therefrom</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he nourished them in the desert forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, and gave them their land an inheritance. And four hundred and fifty years</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>he gave them judges, until Shamuel the prophet;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and then prayed they for themselves a king; and Aloha gave to them Shaol-bar-Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he took him, and raised unto them David the king, and testified of him, and said, I have found David, the son of Jeshai, a man according to my heart; he will perform all my will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>From the seed of this (man) the God of Israel, as he had promised, raised up Jeshu the Redeemer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he sent Juhanon to proclaim before his coming the baptism of repentance to the whole people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And while Juhanon accomplished his ministry, he said, Whom think you that I am? I am not (he), but, behold, he cometh after me, he, the latchet of whose sandals I am not worthy to unloose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>MEN, brethren, sons of the race of Abraham, and they among you who fear Aloha, unto you is sent the word of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they, the inhabitants of Urishlem and their princes, have not consented thereto, nor also to the writings of the prophets which are read on every shabath; but condemned him, and accomplished all that was written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And while they found not any cause of death, they requested Pilatos that they might kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when they had fulfilled every thing that was written concerning him, they took him from the cross, and laid him in a sepulchre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Aloha raised him from among the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he was seen days many by those who had come up with him from Galila to Urishlem, and they are now his witnesses unto the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we also, behold, we preach to you that that promise which was made to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>behold, Aloha hath fulfilled it to their children, (in) that he hath raised up Jeshu; as it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son; This day have I begotten thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And thus did Aloha raise him from among the dead, that again he should not return thither to see corruption; as he had said, I will give you the sure grace of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And again he hath said in another place, Thou hast not given thy Saint to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David in his generation served the will of Aloha, and slept, and was added to his fathers, and saw corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But This whom Aloha raised saw no corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Know then, brethren, that through This himself is preached to you the remission of sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and from all (from) which we could not by the law of Musha be justified, through This all who believe are justified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Beware, then, lest there come upon you that which is written in the prophets:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Behold, despisers, and wonder, and perish: For a work I work in your days Which you will not believe if one should declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when they had gone out from among them, they besought of them that the next shabath they would speak to them these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when the congregation was dissolved, many Jihudoyee went after them; and also the proselytes who worshipped Aloha. And they discoursed (with) and persuaded them to cleave to the grace of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>AND on the next shabath the whole city gathered to hear the word of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when the Jihudoyee saw the great assemblage, they were filled with envy, and arose against the words which Paulos spake, and blasphemed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But Paulos and Bar Naba said to them openly, To you it behoved first to speak the word of Aloha; but because you repel it from you, and determine against yourselves that you are not worthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For so hath our Lord commanded, as it is written, I have set thee a light to the Gentiles, To be for salvation to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And when the Gentiles heard, they rejoiced and glorified Aloha; and they believed who were disposed unto eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the word of Aloha was spoken in all that region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jihudoyee excited the principal men of the city and rich women, who with them feared Aloha, and raised a persecution against Paulos and against Bar Naba, and cast them out from their bounds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And as they went forth, they shook off against them the dust of their feet; and they came to Ikanon, a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Spirit of Holiness.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
