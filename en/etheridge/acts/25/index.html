And the day after he sat on the tribunal, and commanded to bring Paulos.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he had come, the Jihudoyee who had come down from Urishlem surrounded him, and accusations many and hard brought against him, which they were not able to prove;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>while Paulos put forth the mind, that he had not offended in any thing, neither against the law of the Jihudoyee, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Festos, because he willed to accord a favour to the Jihudoyee, said to Paulos, Art thou willing to go up to Urishlem, and there concerning these things to be judged before me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Paulos answered, and said, At the tribunal of Caesar stand I. There it is right for me to be judged. Not any thing have I transgressed against the Jihudoyee, as also thou knowest;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and if a crime I have committed, or any thing worthy of death, I ask not (to be exempted) from death. But, if there be nothing in me of which these accuse me, no man shall give me to them as a gift. I invoke the appeals of Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festos, having spoken with the sons of his council, said, The appeals of Caesar hast thou invoked? To Caesar goest thou.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>AND when days had been, Agripos the king and Bernike came down to Cesarea to salute Festos.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they had been with him (some) days, Festos recounted to the king the judgment of Paulos, saying, A certain man has been left bound by Felix;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when I was at Urishlem, the chief priests and elders of the Jihudoyee informed me against him, and begged that I would do for them judgment against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I told them, it was not the custom of the Romans to give any man as a gift to be killed, until his adversaries have come and accused him to his face, and there be given him place to defend himself against that of which he is accused.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when I had come hither, without delay, the day after I sat on the tribunal, and commanded to bring the man to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And his accusers stood up with him, but could not find any evil accusation to prove against him, (such) as I had expected,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but (had) various questions with him regarding their worship, and concerning Jeshu, a man who was dead, of whom Paulos said that he was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And because I stood not upon the investigation of these (matters), I said to Paulos, Dost thou require to go to Urishlem, and there be judged concerning these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he required to be kept unto the judgment of Caesar; and I commanded that he should be kept until I may send him to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Agripos said, I would hear this man. And Festos said, To-morrow thou shalt hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the day after came Agripos and Bernike with great pomp, and entered the house of judgment, with the tribunes and the chiefs of the city. And Festos commanded, and Paulos came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festos said, King Agripos, and all men who are with us, concerning this man whom you see have all the people of the Jihudoyee taken me at Urishlem and here, crying, that This ought not further to live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>but I perceived not that he had done any thing worthy of death. And because he required to be reserved for the judgment of Caesar, I have commanded that he should be sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But (as) I know not what to write of him unto Caesar, therefore have I willed to bring him before you, and especially before thee, king Agripos, that, having inquired into his case, I may find what to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is not fit when we send a man bound, not to record his transgression.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
