And many of the Kurinthoyee heard and believed in Aloha, and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said in a vision unto Paulos, Fear not, but speak and be not silent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for I am with thee, and no man can do thee harm; and I have much people in this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he abode a year and six months in Kurinthos, and taught them the word of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>AND when Galion was proconsul of Akaia, they gathered together against Paulos, and brought him before the tribunal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, This (man) part from the law persuadeth men to worship Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Paulos sought to open his mouth and speak, Galion said to the Jihudoyee, If it were concerning some thing of evil, or of wickedness, or of abomination, you would complain, O Jihudoyee, it would be proper for me to receive you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but if they be questions concerning language and names, and concerning your law, let them be known among yourselves; for I am not willing to be a judge of these matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them from his tribunal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And all the Heathens seized Sosthenis the presbyter of the synagogue, and beat him before the tribunal. And Galion was careless of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Paulos had been there many days, he gave the salutation to the brethren, and proceeded by sea to go to Syria: and Priskila and Akilos went with him, when he had shaved his head at Kankreos, because he had vowed a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they came to Ephesos. And Paulos entered the synagogue and discoursed with the Jihudoyee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and they requested of him to tarry with them; and he was not willing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for he said, It behoveth me faithfully to perform the feast which cometh at Urishlem; and if Aloha willeth, I will come again to you. And Akilos and Priskila he left at Ephesos;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and he voyaged by sea and came to Cesarea: and he went up and wished the peace of the sons of the church, and went unto Antiokia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he had been there certain days, he went forth and itinerated successively through Phrygia and Galatia, confirming all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And a certain man whose name was Apolu, a Jihudoya, who was by family of Aleksandria, and erudite in speech, and accurate in the scriptures, came to Ephesos.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This was discipled in the way of the Lord, and was fervid in spirit, and he spake and taught freely concerning Jeshu, while knowing not any thing but the baptism of Juhanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he began boldly to speak in the synagogue. And when Akilos and Priskila heard him, they brought him to their house, and fully showed to him the way of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he willed to go to Akaia, the brethren were careful of him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. And when he had gone he helped much, through grace, all the believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he disputed forcibly against the Jihudoyee before the assemblies, while he showed from the scriptures concerning Jeshu, that he is the Meshiha.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
