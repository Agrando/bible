Why hast thou laid up in thy heart to do this thing? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto Aloha!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Hanania heard these words he fell and died. And there was great fear upon all those who heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they who were young men among them arose and composed him, carried him forth and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after there had been three hours, his wife also entered, not knowing what had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Shemun said to her, Tell me if for these prices you sold the field? But she said, Yes: for these prices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shemun said to her, Why have you agreed to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Lo, the feet of the buriers of thy husband are at the door, and they will carry thee out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And at once she fell before their feet and died. And those young men entered and found her dead, and they laid her out, and brought her forth and buried her by the side of her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there was great fear upon all the church and in all them who heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>AND by the hand of the apostles were done great signs and mighty works among the people: and all gathered together at the portico of Shelemun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And from the others not a man dared to come near them; but the people magnified them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the more were they who believed added to the Lord, an assemblage of men and of women;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that into the streets they brought forth the diseased lying on beds, that, when Shemun should come, even his shadow might overshadow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But there came many to them from the other cities round about Urishlem, bringing the diseased and those who had unclean spirits: and they were healed, all of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the chief of the priests, and they who were with him, who were of the doctrine of the Zadukoyee, were filled with envy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and they laid hands on the apostles, and apprehended and bound them in the house of the bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then in the night the angel of the Lord opened the gate of the house of the bound, and brought them forth, and said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go stand in the temple and speak to the people all these words of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they went forth in the time of morning, and entered the temple, and taught. But the chief of the priests and they who were with him arose (and) convoked their associates and the elders of Israel, and sent to the house of the bound to bring the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when they who were sent from them went, they found them not (in) the house of the bound; and they returned, and came,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and said, We found the house of the bound shut carefully, and the keepers standing at the gates: and we opened, but no man found we there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the chief priests and rulers of the temple heard these words, they were astounded by them, and reasoned, what this was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And one came and declared to them, Those men whom you shut up in the house of the bound, behold, they are standing in the temple and teaching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then went the rulers with the satellites to bring them, not with violence, for they feared lest the people should stone them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and when they had brought them they made them stand before all the assembly, and the chief of the priests began to say to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Did we not commanding command you, that you should teach no man in this name? But, behold, you have filled Urishlem with your doctrine, and you will to bring upon us the blood of this man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>SHEMUN answered with the apostles and said to them, Aloha must we obey rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers hath raised up Jeshu whom you killed and hanged on the tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Him hath Aloha constituted a Prince and a Saviour, and elevated him at his right hand, to give repentance and remission of sins unto Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we are witnesses of these words, and the Spirit of Holiness himself, whom Aloha hath given to them who believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they heard these words they were transported with rage, and were mindful to kill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And one of the Pharishee arose, whose name was Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, and honoured by all the people, and commanded to take the apostles without a little time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, Men, sons of Israel, beware of yourselves, and consider what it behoves you to do concerning these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For before this time arose Thuda, and said of himself that he was something great, and there went after him four hundred men: and he was slain, and they who went after him were scattered and became as nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Afterward arose Jihuda Galiloya in the days when men were enregistered for the head-silver, and tempted much people after him; and he died, and all they who went after him were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I say to you, keep aloof from these men, and dismiss them; for if from men be this imagination and this work, it will be dissolved and end;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but if it be from Aloha, there is no power in your hands to bring it to an end: lest you should be found to have arisen against Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they were persuaded by him, and called the apostles, and scourged them, and commanded them that they should not teach in the name of Jeshu, and loosed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they went out from before them, rejoicing to be worthy for the sake of the Name to be ill treated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they ceased not daily to teach in the temple, and in the house, and to preach concerning our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
