Therefore the world doth not know us, because that it hath also not known him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>MY beloved, now are we the sons of Aloha; and it is not manifest, as yet, what we are to become, but we know, that when he is manifested, in his likeness we are and see him, according to that which he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And every one who hath in him this hope, purifieth himself, as He is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But whoever committeth sin doeth iniquity; for all sin is iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you know that he was manifested to bear our sins, and sin in him is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And every one who in him abideth, sinneth not. And every one who sinneth, hath not seen him, nor known him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My sons, let no man deceive you: he who worketh righteousness is righteous, as also the Meshiha himself is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he who doeth sin is of Satana, because that from the commencement Satana was a sinner. And for this cause did the Son of Aloha appear, that he might destroy the works of Satana.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Every one who is born of Aloha, sin doth not work, because that his seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because of Aloha he is born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this are distinguished the sons of Aloha from the sons of Satana; every one who doeth not righteousness, nor loveth his brother, is not of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the commandment which you have heard from before, that you love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not as Koen, who was from the Evil, and killed his brother. And on what account killed he him? unless that his own works were evil and his brother's righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world hate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed from death unto life, by this, that we love our brethren. He who loveth not his brother, in death continueth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For every one who hateth his brother is a man-killer; and we know that in no man-killer can abide the life which is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In this we know His love toward us, that he gave himself for us; (so) also it is right for us for the sake of our brethren to give ourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he who hath the possession of the world, and shall see his brother that he needeth, and shall shut his compassions from him, how is there in him the love of Aloha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>My sons, let us not love one another in words and in tongue, but in works and in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And by this we make known that we are of the truth, and before that he cometh we make confident our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And if our heart condemn us, how much (more) Aloha, who is greater than our heart, and knoweth every thing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>My beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have openness of face before Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever we ask, we shall receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things which are beautiful before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his commandment, That we believe in the name of his Son Jeshu Meshiha, and love one another, as he hath commanded us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he who keepeth his commandments, is kept by him, and he dwelleth in him: and by this we perceive that he dwelleth in us, by his Spirit whom he hath given to us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
