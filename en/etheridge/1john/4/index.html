But we are of Aloha; and he who knoweth Aloha heareth us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and he who is not of Aloha heareth us not. In this itself we perceive the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>my beloved, let us love one another, because love is of Aloha; and every one who loveth from Aloha is born, and knoweth Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For Aloha is Love; and every one who loveth not, knoweth not Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In this was made known the love of Aloha towards us, that Aloha sent his only Son into the world that we might live by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In this is love: it was not that we had loved Aloha, but that Aloha himself loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>MY beloved, if Aloha so hath loved us, we also are indebted to love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Aloha no man hath seen but if we love one another, Aloha in us abideth, and his love is fulfilled in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And by this we know that in him we abide, and he abideth in us, because of his Spirit he hath given us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and we testify that the Father hath sent his Son, the Redeemer of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Whosoever confesseth Jeshu that he is the Son of Aloha, in him Aloha abideth, and he abideth in Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we have believed and known the love which Aloha hath toward us; for Aloha is Love. And every one who abideth in love in Aloha abideth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in this is his love perfected with us, that openness of face we might have in the day of judgment; because that as He was, so also we are in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Fear in love is not: but perfect love hath cast out fear, because fear is in terror. He who feareth is not perfect in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We then will love Aloha, because he hath first loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if one shall say, I love Aloha, and his brother he hateth, he is a liar. For he who his brother whom he hath seen loveth not, how can he love Aloha himself whom he hath not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this commandment we have received from him, That every one who loveth Aloha shall love also his brother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
