And if a man shall sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeshu Meshiha, the Just;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>for he is the propitiation for our sins, and not on behalf of ours only, but also on behalf of the whole world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And by this we feel that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he who saith that he knoweth him, and his commandments keepeth not, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But he who keepeth his word, in him is perfected truly the love of Aloha; for by this we know that we are in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He who saith, I am in him, ought according to his walkings to walk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>MY beloved, a new commandment I write not to you, but the old commandment, that which was with you from the beginning; but the old commandment is the word which you have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again, a new commandment I write to you, that which is true in him and in you; because the darkness hath passed, and the true light beginneth to appear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Whoever saith, then, that he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He who loveth his brother, in the light abideth, and offence is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He who hateth his brother is in darkness, and in the darkness walketh, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness itself hath blinded his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I write to you, sons, because forgiven to you are your sins for the sake of his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who hath been from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked. I have written to you, children, because you have known the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who (hath been) from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of Aloha remaineth in you, and you have overcome the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Love not the world, nor any thing which is in it; for whoever loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For every thing that is in the world, is the lust of the body, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of the world. These which are not of the Father, but they are from the world itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the world passeth, (both) it and its lusts; but he who doeth the will of Aloha, continueth for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>my sons, it is the last time: and as you have heard, the false meshiha cometh; and now there are many false meshihas, and from this we know that it is the last time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From us they went forth, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, with us would they have remained. But they went forth from us, that it might be known that they were not of us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And you have an anointing from the Holy, and you discern every man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but you know it, and that no lie is of it, of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Who is a liar, if not he who denieth that Jeshu is the Meshiha? and this (one) is a false meshiha. He who denieth the Father, denieth also the Son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and he who denieth the Son, disbelieveth also the Father. Whoso confesseth the Son, the Father also confesseth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you, what you have heard from the first, let it continue with you. For, if what you have heard from the first continue with you, you also will continue in the Father and in the Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And this is the promise which he promised to us, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But these I have written to you, because of those who would seduce you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And you, also, if the anointing continue with you which you have received from him, have not need that a man should teach you; but as the anointing that is from Aloha itself teacheth you concerning every thing, and is true, neither is falsity in it; and as it hath taught you, continue in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And now, my sons, continue in him: that when he is manifested we may not he confounded of him, but we may have confidence at his coming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If you know that he is righteous, know also that every one who doeth righteousness is of him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
