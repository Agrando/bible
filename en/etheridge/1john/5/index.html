And every one who loveth the Generator loveth also him who is generated of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And by this we know that we love the children of Aloha, when we love Aloha, and work his commandments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For this is the love of Aloha, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not heavy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Because every one who is born of Aloha overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For who (is he) that overcometh the world, but he who believeth that Jeshu is the Son of Aloha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is he who came by water and blood, Jeshu the Meshiha: it was not by water only, but by water and blood; and the Spirit testifieth, because the Spirit himself is truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there are three that testify, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and these three are in one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If the testimony of men we receive, how much greater is the testimony of Aloha? and this is the testimony which Aloha hath testified concerning his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whosoever believeth in the Son of Aloha hath this testimony in himself. Every one who believeth not Aloha hath made him a liar, in not believing the testimony that he hath testified concerning his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the testimony, That the life which is eternal, Aloha hath given to us, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Every one who apprehendeth the Son, apprehendeth also life; and every one who apprehendeth not the Son of Aloha, hath not life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These I have written to you, that you may know that you have the life which is eternal, who believe in the name of the Son of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the assurance that we have toward him, that all that we ask of him according to his will, he heareth us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we are persuaded that he heareth us concerning what we ask from him, we are confident of receiving already the requests that we ask from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>if a man shall see his brother sin a sin not obnoxious to the death, he shall ask, and life be given to him, to those who sin not as unto the death. For there is the sin of death;-it is not concerning this I say that a man shall pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For all iniquity is sin; and there is sin which is not of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And we know that every one who is born of Aloha sinneth not. For he who is born of Aloha keepeth himself, and the Evil doth not approach him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know that we are of Aloha, and the whole world in the Evil is lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And we know that the Son of Aloha hath come, and hath given us knowledge to know the truth, and to be in him in the truth, in his Son Jeshu the Meshiha.
