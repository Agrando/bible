They repute as pleasure the luxury which is in the day. Blemishes (are they), full of spots, who delighting in their refreshments are luxurious:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>having eyes full of adultery, and sins which cease not, alluring souls that are not established. An heart have they which is disciplined in covetousness; sons of malediction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who, forsaking the straight way, have erred, and gone in the way of Belam bar Beur, who the wages of iniquity loved. But he had reproof of his transgression;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(for) the dumb ass which spake with the voice of man rebuked the madness of the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are wells without water, clouds driven from above, unto whom the blackness of darkness is reserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For while they speak scoffing words of vanity, they allure with impure desires of the flesh those who almost escaped from them who have their conversation in error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And liberty to them they promise, while they (themselves) are the servants of corruption; for the thing by which a man is overcome, to that he is subject.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if they have escaped from the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeshu Meshiha, with those very things entangled they are again over-come, their end becomes worse than the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it had been more tolerable for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, when they knew, to turn backward from the holy commandment delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But it hath happened to them according to the true proverb, that The dog hath turned unto his vomit; the sow which had washed into the wallow of the mire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
