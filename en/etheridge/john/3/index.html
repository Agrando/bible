Who can again the womb of his mother the second time enter, and be born?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jeshu answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, That if a man be not born of waters and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whatever is born of the flesh, is flesh; and whatever is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Wonder not that I have said to thee, that it behoves you to be born anew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind bloweth where she willeth, and her voice thou hearest; but thou knowest not whence she cometh, nor whither she goeth: so is every man who is born of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nikodimos answered and said to him, How can these things be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jeshu answered and said to him, Art thou Malphona of Israel, and these knowest not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Amen, amen, I say to thee, What we know we speak, and what we have seen we testify; but our testimony you receive not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If of (what is) on earth I tell you, and you believe not, how if I tell you of (what is) in heaven, could you believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>AND no man hath ascended into heaven, but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man, he who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as Musha elevated the serpent in the wilderness, so is to be elevated the Son of man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>that every man who believeth in him might not perish, but have the life which is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For so loved Aloha the world, as his Son, the Only-begotten, he would give, that every one who believeth in him might not perish, but have the life which is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Aloha sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might live by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He who believeth on him is not judged, and he who believeth not is judged already, because he believeth not in the name of the only-begotten Son of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the judgment, that the light hath come into the world, and the sons of men have loved darkness rather than the light, for their deeds have been evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For every one who doeth abominable things hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he who doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be known that in Aloha they are wrought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>AFTER these came Jeshu and his disciples into the land of Jihuda, and there conversed with them and baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Juchanon also was baptizing in Ein-yon, near Sholim, because the waters were there many; and they came and were baptized;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for not yet was Juchanon cast into the house of the bound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But there was a question with some of the disciples of Juchanon (and) a certain Jihudoya, upon purification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came to Juchanon, and said to him, Raban, he who was with thee at the passage of Jurdan, (and) concerning whom thou didst give witness, he also baptizeth, and many come to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Juchanon answered and said to them, A man cannot receive of his own will any thing, unless it be given to him from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You bear me witness that I said, I am not the Meshicha, but I am an apostle before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and attendeth him, with great joy rejoiceth on account of the voice of the bridegroom: this my joy therefore, behold, is complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>To him it must be to increase, and to me to decrease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For he who from above hath come, is above all; and he who is from the earth, is of the earth, and of the earth speaketh: he who from heaven hath come, is above all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what he hath seen and heard he testifieth, and his testimony no man receiveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he who hath received his testimony, hath sealed that the true Aloha is he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For he whom Aloha hath sent, the very words of Aloha speaketh; for it was not in measure that Aloha gave the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loveth the Son, and every thing hath he given into his hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who believeth in the Son hath the life which is eternal; and he who obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of Aloha remaineth on him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
