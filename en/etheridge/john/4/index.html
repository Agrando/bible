But Jeshu was wearied with the labour of the way, and sat by the fountain; and it was six hours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There came a woman from Shomreen to draw waters, and Jeshu said to her, Give me waters to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now his disciples had gone into the city to buy for them meat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The woman, the Shomroytha, saith to him, How (canst) thou who art a Jihudoya ask drink of me who am a woman, a Shomroytha? For the Jihudoyee have no accommodation with the Shomroyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jeshu answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of Aloha, and who He is who hath said to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he had given thee living waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>That woman saith to him, My Lord, thou hast no vessel, and the well is deep; whence hast thou living waters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Art thou greater than our father Jakub, he who gave us this well, and himself drank of it, and his children, and his flocks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jeshu answered and said to her, Every one who shall drink of these waters again will thirst;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>but every one who shall drink of the waters that I will give him shall never thirst; but those waters that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of waters, that shall spring forth to the life of eternity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>That woman saith to him, My Lord, give me of those waters, that I thirst not again, nor come to draw from hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jeshu saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>She saith to him, I have no husband. Jeshu saith to her, Well hast thou said, I have no husband;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for five husbands hast thou had, and this whom thou now hast is not thy husband; this hast thou said truly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>That woman saith to him, My Lord, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers in this mountain worshipped, and you say that in Urishlem is the place where it behoves to worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jeshu saith to her, Woman, believe me that the hour cometh when neither in this mountain, nor at Urishlem, you shall worship the Father:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>you worship something you know not; but we worship whom we know; for salvation is from the Jihudoyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father also requireth worshippers such as these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Aloha is a Spirit; and they who worship him, in spirit and in truth must worship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>That woman saith to him, I know that the Meshicha cometh; and when he hath come, he will teach us all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeshu saith to her, I am (he), I who speak with thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he spoke, his disciples came, and they wondered that with the woman he spoke; but no man said, What inquirest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The woman left her water-pot, and went into the city, and saith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Come, see a man who hath told me every thing that I have done: is not this the Meshicha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the men went out of the city, and came with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Between these things his disciples entreated of him, saying to him, Raban, eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he said to them, I have food to eat of which you know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The disciples say among themselves, Has any man brought him somewhat to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jeshu saith to them, My meat is to do the will of Him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Say you not, that after four moons cometh harvest? Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes, and see the lands which have become white for the harvest already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he who reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; and the sower and the reaper shall rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For in this is the proverb true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap that (for) which you did not toil; for others toiled, and you have entered upon their labour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now of that city many Shomroyee believed in him, because of the saying of that woman, who testified, He told me every thing that I have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when those Shomroyee came to him, they besought him to be with them. And he was with them two days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and many believed through his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said to the woman, Now not through thy word believe we in him; for we have heard and known that this is truly the Meshicha, the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>AND after two days Jeshu went forth from thence, and came into Galila;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for he himself testified, that a prophet in his own city is not honoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when he came to Galila, the Galiloyee received him, because they had seen all the signs which he had done in Urishlem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So Jeshu came again into Kotna of Galila, where he had made the waters wine. And there was at Kapher-nachum the servant of a certain king, whose son was ill.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>This (man) heard that Jeshu had come from Jihuda into Galila; and he came to him, and besought him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was near to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Jeshu saith to him, If signs and wonders you do not SEE, you will not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The servant of the king saith to him, My lord, come down ere my child die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jeshu saith to him, Go, thy son liveth. And the man believed in the word which Jeshu had spoken to him, and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But as he was going down, his servants met him, and gave him good news, saying to him, Thy son liveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he asked at what time he was healed. They say to him, Yesterday, at seven hours, the fever left him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And his father knew that in that hour it was in which Jeshu said to him, Thy son liveth; and he believed, and all his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>This is again the second sign (which) Jeshu did when he had come from Jihuda into Galila.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
