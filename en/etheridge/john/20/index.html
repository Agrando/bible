And she ran, and came to Shemun Kipha, and to that other disciple, whom Jeshu loved, saying to them, They have taken away our Lord from that house of burial, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Shemun went forth, and that other disciple, and they came to the house of burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they ran both of them together; but that disciple ran before Shemun, and came first to the house of burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And looking, he saw the cloths lying, but entering he entered not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Shemun came after him, and went into the house of burial, and saw the cloths set,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and the napkin that had been bound upon his head, not with the cloths, but folded up, and laid apart in one place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then went in also that disciple who came first to the house of burial, and he saw, and believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For not yet knew they the scriptures, that he was to rise from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And those disciples went again to their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But Mariam stood at the sepulchre weeping: and while weeping, she looked into the sepulchre,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and saw two angels in white, who were sitting, one at his pillows, and one at his feet, where the body of Jeshu had lain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>This said she, and turned herself back, and saw Jeshu standing, and knew not that it was Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jeshu saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? and whom seekest thou? But she thought he was the gardener, and said to him, Sir, if thou have taken him away, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will go (and) take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jeshu saith to her, Mariam. She turned and saith to him in Hebrew, Rabuni, which is saying, Malphona.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jeshu saith to her, Touch me not; for not yet have I ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and to your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then went Mariam Magdalitha, and announced to the disciples that she had seen our Lord, and (that) these (words) he had spoken to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>WHEN it was the evening of that day which (was) the first in the week, and the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jihudoyee, came Jeshu, stood among them, and said to them, Peace (be) with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This he said, and showed them his hands and his side. And the disciples rejoiced when they saw our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then said Jeshu unto them, Peace (be) with you: as my Father sent me, I also send you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said these, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Spirit of Holiness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>if you forgive sins to a man, they shall be forgiven to him; and if you retain (the sins) of a man, they are retained.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Thoma, one of the twelve, he who was called the Twin, was not there with them when Jeshu came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the disciples say to him, We have seen our Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the places of the nails, and put into them my fingers, and extend my hand into his side, I believe not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>AND after eight days again within were the disciples, and Thoma with them. And Jeshu came, while the doors were shut, stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace (be) with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to Thoma, Bring thy finger hither and see my hands, and bring thy hand and thrust it into my side, and be not unbelieving but believing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Thoma answered and said to him, My Lord, and my God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeshu saith to him, Now that thou hast seen, thou hast believed: blessed are they who have not seen me, and have believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many other signs did Jeshu before his disciples: those are not written in this record;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but these are written, that you may believe that Jeshu is the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha, and that when you have believed you may have in his name the life which is eternal.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
