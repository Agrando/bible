Jeshu saith to them, I am. And Jihuda the traitor was also standing with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Jeshu had said to them, I am, they went backward and fell upon the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jeshu again asked them, Whom seek you? Then they said, Jeshu Natsroia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jeshu saith to them, I have told you that I am; and if me you seek, let these go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>That the word might be fulfilled which he spake, Of those whom thou hast given me I have not lost even one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Shemun Kipha had a sword upon him, and he drew it, and smote the servant of the high priest, and took off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the name of the servant was Molek. Jeshu said to Kipha, Put up the sword into its sheath; the cup which my Father hath given me shall I not drink it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the band and the captains and the officials of the Jihudoyee took Jeshu and bound him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and brought him unto Chanan first, because he was father-in-law of Kaiapha, he who was the high priest of that year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was Kaiapha, he, who had counselled the Jihudoyee that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Shemun Kipha, and one of the other disciples, came after Jeshu. And that disciple knew the chief of the priests, and went in with Jeshu into the hall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Shemun stood without at the door. And that other disciple, who knew the chief of the priests, went out and told the keeper of the door to admit Shemun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the damsel keeping the door said to Shemun, Art thou also of the disciples of this man? He saith to her, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the servants and officials were standing, and they had set a fire to warm them, because it was cold; and Shemun stood also with them and warmed himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the high priest questioned Jeshu concerning his disciples, and concerning his doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jeshu said to him, I openly discoursed with the people, and, at all time, taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jihudoyee assemble. And nothing in secret have I spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why askest thou me? Ask them who have heard what I have said with them. Behold, they know every thing that I have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as these (words) he spake, one of the officers who stood (by) struck Jeshu upon his cheek, and said to him, Thus givest thou the answer to the chief of the priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jeshu replied and said to him, If wickedly I have spoken, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why hast thou struck me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Chanan had sent Jeshu bound unto Kaiapha, chief of the priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Shemun Kipha stood and warmed (himself), and they say to him, Thou art also one of his disciples? And he denied and said, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>One of the servants of the chief of the priests said to him, the brother of him whose ear Shemun had cut off, Did not I see thee with him in the garden?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And again Shemun denied. And in the same hour the cock crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>NOW they led Jeshu from Kaiapha into the praetorium, and it was early. But they would not enter the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, until they should have eaten the petscha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Pilatos came forth to them without, and said to them, What accusation have you against this man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They answered and said to him, If he were not a worker of evils, we would not to thee have delivered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pilatos saith to them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Jihudoyee say to him, It is not lawful for us to put any one to death. That the word that Jeshu spake might be accomplished, when he declared by what death he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But Pilatos entered the Praetorium, and called Jeshu, and said to him, Art thou the king of the Jihudoyee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jeshu saith to him, Of thyself sayest thou this, or did others tell thee concerning me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Pilatos saith to him, Am I a Jihudoya? The sons of thy people and the chief priests have delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jeshu saith to him, My kingdom is not from this world. If from this world were my kingdom, my servants would have fought, that I should not have been delivered to the Jihudoyee. But now my kingdom is not from hence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Pilatos saith to him, Then thou art a king? Jeshu saith to him, Thou hast said that I am a king. For this am I born, and for this I came into the world, to testify of the truth. Every one who is of the truth heareth my voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Pilatos said to him, What is the truth? And when he had said this, he went forth again to the Jihudoyee, and said to them, I find not one cause in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But you have a custom that one I should release to you at the petscha. Will you, therefore, that I release to you this King of the Jihudoyee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they all cried and said, Not this, but Bar Aba. Now this Bar Aba was a robber.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
