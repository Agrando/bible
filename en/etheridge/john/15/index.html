As the branch cannot give fruits of itself if it abide not in the vine, so also cannot you, if you abide not in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I am the vine, and you the branches. Whoso abideth in me, and I in him, this produceth much fruits, because without me you cannot do any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But if a man abide not in me, he is cast without, as a withered branch; and, gathering, they cast it into the fire to burn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if you abide in me, and my words abide in you, all whatever you will to ask shall be unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>IN this is glorified my Father, that much fruit you give, and be my disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As my Father hath loved me, so I have loved you: continue in the love of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If my commandments you will keep, you shall abide in my love; as I have kept the commandments of my Father, and abide in his love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These have I spoken with you, that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Love which is greater than this is not, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are my friends, if you do all that I command you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>No more I call you servants, for the servant knoweth not what doeth his Lord; but my friends have I called you; wherefore all that I have heard from my Father, I have made known unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and placed you, that you also may go (and) yield much fruit; and your fruit shall remain, because all that you shall ask the Father in my name, he will give to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These I command you, That you love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the world hate you, know that, before you, it hated me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if of the world you were, the world its own would have loved; but you are not of the world, for I have chosen you from the world; on which account the world hateth you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Remember the word which I spake with you, That there is no servant who is greater than his lord. If me they have persecuted, you also will they persecute; and if my word they had kept, yours also would they keep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But these all will they do to you on account of my name, because they know not Him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If I had not come and spoken with them, they had not had sin; but now have they no pretext for their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He who hateth me, my Father also hateth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if the works I had not done before their eyes which no other man hath done, they had not had sin; but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law, They hated me undeservedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But when the Paraclete cometh, He whom I will send unto you from my Father, the Spirit of Truth, He who from my Father cometh forth, He shall testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You also testify, because from the beginning are you with me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
