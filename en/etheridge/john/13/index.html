Jeshu saith to him, If I do not wash thee, thou hast with me no part.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Shemun Kipha saith to him, Then, my Lord, not only my feet shalt thou wash for me, but also my hands, also my head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jeshu saith, He that hath bathed needeth not but his feet only to wash, for all of him he hath cleansed: also you are clean, but not all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For Jeshu knew who was betraying him; therefore he said, Ye are not all of you clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when he had washed their feet, he took up his garments and reclined, and said to them, Know you what I have done for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me Our Master, and Our Lord; and well say you, for I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If I then, your Lord and your Master, have washed for you your feet, how much more ought you to wash the feet of one another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this pattern have I given you, that as I have done to you, you also should do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Amen, amen, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; nor (is) the apostle greater than he who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If these you know, happy are you if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Not of all of you do I speak; for I know those whom I have chosen; but that the scripture might be fulfilled, that he who eateth bread with me hath lifted against me his heel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now I tell you before it shall be, that when it is done you may believe that I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Amen, amen, I say to you, Whoever receiveth him whom I send receiveth me; and whoever receiveth me receiveth him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These said Jeshu, and was agitated in his spirit, and testified, and said, Amen, amen, I say to you, That one of you shall betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the disciples looked one on the other, because they knew not concerning whom he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there was of his disciples one who reclined on his bosom; he whom Jeshu loved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>To this signed Shemun Kipha that he would ask of whom it was that he spake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And that disciple fell upon the bosom of Jeshu, and said to him, My Lord, who is this?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeshu answered and said to him, He to whom I give the dipped bread. And Jeshu dipped the bread and gave it to Jihuda bar Shemun Scarjuta.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then after the bread Satana entered into him. And Jeshu said to him, What thou doest, do with speed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But this no man knew of those who reclined of what he spake to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some of them thought that as Jihuda had the purse, he had instructed him to buy something that should be required at the feast, or that he should give somewhat to the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he, Jihuda, received the bread and immediately went out: and it was night when he went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>AND Jeshu said, Now is glorified the Son of man, and Aloha is glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And if Aloha is glorified in him, Aloha shall glorify him in himself, and at once doth glorify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>My sons, a little longer I am with you, and you will seek me; and, as I said to the Jihudoyee, Whither I go you cannot come, so to you say I now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>A new commandment give I to you, that you should love one another; as I have loved you, so do you also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if love be in you one for another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Shemun Kipha said to him, Our Lord, whither goest thou? Jeshu said to him, Whither I go, thou canst not now come after me; but at the last thou shalt come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Shemun Kipha saith to him, My Lord, why cannot I come after thee now? My life for thee lay I down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jeshu saith to him, Dost thou lay down thy life for me! Amen, amen, I tell thee, That the cock will not crow, until thou shalt have denied me three times.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
