For the day of my burial had she kept it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>In all time the poor you have with you; but me you have not at all time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a great company of Jihudoyee who were there heard Jeshu. And they had come not on Jeshu's account only, but also to see Loozar, he whom he had raised from among the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But the chief priests were minded to slay Loozar also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because many of the Jihudoyee on account of him had gone and believed in Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>THE day after, a great gathering of those who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jeshu was coming to Urishlem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>took branches of palms, and went forth to meet him. And they cried out, saying, Aushana! Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jeshu caused to be found an ass, and sat upon him; as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Fear not, daughter of Tseun: behold, thy King cometh to thee, and riding on a colt, the foal of an ass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But these the disciples knew not at that time; but when Jeshu was glorified, the disciples remembered that these were written concerning him, and (that) these (things) they had done unto him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the assembly that was with him when he called Loozar from the sepulchre, and raised him from among the dead, bare witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And on account of this, great multitudes went forth to receive him; for they had heard that this sign he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But the Pharishee said one to another, See you that you do not profit any thing! For, behold, the whole world is gone after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were also from the Gentiles men who had ascended to worship at the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>These came and drew near to Philipos, who was of Beth-tsaida of Galila; and they requested of him, and said to him, Mari, we desire to see Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Philipos came and told Andreas, and Andreas and Philipos told Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>BUT Jeshu answered and said to them, The hour hath come that the Son of man may be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Amen, amen, I say to you, That a grain of wheat if it fall not and die in the earth remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth much fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He who loveth his life shall lose it; and he who hateth his life in this world shall keep it to the life which is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If any man serve me, let him come after me; and where I am, there shall be also my servant: whoever serveth me, him will my Father honour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now my soul, behold it is commoved; and what shall I say? My Father, deliver me from this hour:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>but on account of this have I come unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. And the voice was heard from heaven, I have glorified, and again I glorify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the company who stood, heard, and they said there was thunder. But others said, An angel spake with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, Not on my account was this voice, but on your account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world; now is the ruler of this world cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, when I have been lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But this he said to show by what death he should die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The people said to him, We have heard from the law that the Meshicha for ever abideth: how sayest thou that the Son of man is to be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jeshu saith to them, A little further time is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And whoever walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have the light, believe in the light, that the sons of light you may become. These spake Jeshu, and went (and) concealed himself from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Yet though all these signs he had done before them, they believed not in him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>that the word of the prophet Eshaia might be fulfilled, who said, My Lord, who hath believed our report, And the arm of the Lord, to whom hath it been revealed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Because of this they were not able to believe: Wherefore again Eshaia had said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>He hath blinded their eyes, And darkened their heart, That they should not see with their eyes, And understand with their heart, And be turned, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>These said Eshaia when he saw his glory, and spake concerning him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Yet of the chiefs also many believed in him: but because of the Pharishee they did not confess, that they might not be put out of the synagogue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But Jeshu cried and said, He who believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he who seeth me seeth him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I the light am come into the world, that every one who believeth in me might not abide in darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he who heareth my words, and doth not keep them, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>He who rejecteth me, and receiveth not my word, hath that which judgeth him: the word which I speak, that judgeth him in the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I of myself have not spoken, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandments are life everlasting: these therefore which I speak, as said to me my Father, so I speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
