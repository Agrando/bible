Not yet hath come mine hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>His mother saith to the servitors, Whatever he telleth you, do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there were six waterpots of stone set there, unto the purification of the Jihudoyee, which contained each two quarantals or three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jeshu saith to them, Fill these water-pots with waters; and they filled them to the top.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He saith to them, Draw now, and carry to the chief of the guests. And they carried.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when that chief of the guests had tasted those waters which were made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servitors knew, who had filled them with waters,) the chief of the guests called the bridegroom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said to him, Every man at first the good wine produceth, and when they are satisfied, then that which is inferior; but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This is the first sign that Jeshu wrought in Kotna of Galila, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>AFTER this he went to Kapher-nachum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples. And they were there a few days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the petscha of the Jihudoyee was nigh, and Jeshu went up to Urishlem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he made him a scourge of cord, and drove them all from the temple, and the sheep and the oxen and the money-changers; and he shed their money, and their tables he overturned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And to those who sold doves he said, Take these hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy house hath devoured me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Jihudoyee answered and said to him, What sign showest thou to us, as these things thou doest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jeshu answered, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The Jihudoyee say to him, Forty-and six years was this temple being built, and wilt thou in three days raise it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But he spake of the temple of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he was risen from the house of the dead, his disciples remembered that this he had said; and they believed the scriptures, and the word which Jeshu had spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>WHILE Jeshu was in Jerusalem at the petscha, at the feast, Many believed in him who saw the signs which he wrought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he, Jeshu, did not confide himself to them, because he knew every man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and needed not that any should testify to him concerning any man, because he knew what is in man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
