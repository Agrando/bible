For the Father loveth the Son, and every thing that he doeth he showeth him; and greater than these works he showeth him, that you may wonder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For as the Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth, so also the Son quickeneth those whom he willeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Father judgeth no man, but all judgment he hath given to the Son;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that all men should honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Amen, amen, I say to you, He who heareth my word and believeth on him who sent me, hath the life that is eternal, and into condemnation he cometh not, but hath passed from death unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Amen, amen, I say to you, That the hour cometh and also now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of Aloha; and they who hear shall live</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as the Father hath life in his person, so hath he given also to the Son to have life in his person,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and hath empowered him also to execute judgment. Because he is the Son of man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>marvel not at this; for the hour cometh when all they who are in the sepulchres shall hear his voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and shall come forth; they who have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they who have done evil unto the resurrection of condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I CANNOT of the will of myself do any thing; but as I hear I judge, and my judgment is just; for I seek not my will, but the will of Him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>If I should witness concerning myself, my testimony would not be (regarded as) truth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>there is another who witnesseth of me, and I know that true is his testimony which he hath witnessed of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You sent to Juchanon, and he witnessed of the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I do not from man (only) receive testimony. But these (things) speak I that you may be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>He was a lamp that burneth and shineth, and you were willing to glory for the hour in his light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have a testimony which is greater than that of Juchanon; for the works that the Father hath given me to accomplish, these works that I do testify of me that the Father hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the Father who hath sent me, he testifieth of me: but his voice you have never heard, nor his appearance seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And his word abideth not in you, because in Him whom he hath sent you do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Investigate the scriptures; for in them you think you have the life that is eternal, and they testify of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And you will not come to me that the life that is eternal you might have.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Glory from the sons of men I receive not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But I know you, that the love of Aloha is not in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>I have come in the name of my Father, and you have not received me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>If another should come in his own name, him you would receive. How can you believe, who glory one from another are receiving, and the glory which is from one, Aloha, you seek not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>How think you that I will accuse you before the Father? There is one who accuseth you, Musha himself, in whom you hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if in Musha you had believed, you would also have believed in me; for Musha of me hath written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But if his writings you believe not, how my words will you believe?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
