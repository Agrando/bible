No man cometh unto my Father unless by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if me you had known, my Father also would you have known: and henceforth you know him and have seen him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Philipos saith to him, Our Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Jeshu saith to him, All this time have I been with you, and hast thou not known me, Philip√©? He who me seeth, seeth the Father; and how sayest thou, Show us the Father?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Believest thou not that I am in my Father and my Father in me? And these words that I speak, I speak not from myself, but my Father who dwelleth in me, he doeth these works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Believe that I am in my Father and my Father in me; and if not, even on account of the works, believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Amen, amen, I say to you, That whosoever believeth in me, these works that I do shall he do also; and more than these shall he do, because I go unto my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And whatsoever you shall ask in my name, I will do for you, that the Father may be glorified in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if you shall ask (of) me in my name, I will do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>IF you love me, keep my commandments;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and I will pray of my Father, and another Paraclete will he give you, who will be with you for ever,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the Spirit of truth, he whom the world cannot receive, because it doth not see him, nor know him. But you know him; for with you he dwelleth, and in you is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I will not leave you orphans; for I will come to you a little after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the world seeth me not, but you shall see me; for because I live, you also shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He who hath my commandments and keepeth them is he who loveth me; and he who loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest to him myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Jihuda saith to him, (it was not Scarjuta,) My Lord, how to us wilt thou manifest thyself, and not to the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jeshu replied, and said to him, He who loveth me, my word keepeth, and my Father will love him, and unto him we come, and a dwelling-place with him we make.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he who loveth me not, keepeth not my word. And the word that you hear is not mine, but of the Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These have I spoken with you while I am with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But he, the Paraclete, the Spirit of Holiness, whom the Father sendeth in my name, he shall teach you every thing, and he shall remind you of all that I have said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>PEACE I leave with you; my peace I give to you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have heard what I have told you, that I go, and come to you (again). If you had loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to my Father; for my Father is greater than I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, behold, I have told you while it is not done, that when it has been you may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Henceforth I will not speak with you much; for the ruler of the world cometh, and in me hath he nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But that the world may know that I love my Father, and as my Father hath commanded, so I do. Arise, let us go hence!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
