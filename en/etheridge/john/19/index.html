And Pilatos said to them, Behold the man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when the chief priests and officials saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him! Pilatos saith to them, Take you him and crucify him; for I find in him no cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The Jihudoyee say to him, We have a law, and, according to our law, he is guilty of death, because he made himself the son of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When Pilatos heard that word, he the more feared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he entered again the praetorium, and said to Jeshu, Whence art thou? But Jeshu gave him no answer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Pilatos saith to him, With me speakest thou not? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and power to crucify thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Jeshu saith to him, Thou against ME hast no power, no not any, unless it hath been given to thee from above: wherefore he who delivered me to thee hath a sin greater than thine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On this account Pilatos willed to release him: but the Jihudoyee cried out, If this (man) thou releasest, thou art not the friend of Cesar: for whosoever maketh himself a king is the adversary of Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when Pilatos heard that word, he brought Jeshu without, and sat down upon the tribunal in the place which is called the Pavement of Stones, but in Hebrew it is called Gaphiphtha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it was the preparation for the petscha. AND it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jihudoyee, Behold your king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But they cried out, Take him away, take him away! crucify him, crucify him! Pilatos saith to them, Your king shall I crucify? The chief priests say to him, We have no king but Cesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then delivered he him to them, that they might crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they took Jeshu, and led him forth, bearing his cross to a place which is called A Skull, but in Hebrew is Gogultha:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>there they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jeshu in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And a tablet also wrote Pilatos, and set it on the cross; and it was thus written, This is Jeshu Natsroya, King of the Jihudoyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And this title many of the Jihudoyee read; for nigh to the city was the place where Jeshu was crucified; and the writing was in Hebrew and Greek and Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the chief priests said to Pilatos, Do not write that he is king of the Jihudoyee, but that he said, I am the king of the Jihudoyee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilatos saith, That which I have written, I have written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>BUT the soldiers, when they had crucified Jeshu, took his vestments and made four parts, a part unto each one of the soldiers: but his tunic was without seam, from the top woven all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they said one to another, Let us not rend it, but play for it by playing, (to decide) whose it shall be: and fulfilled was the scripture which had said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They divided my garments among them, And upon my raiment did they cast the lot. These things did the soldiers. But there stood by the cross of Jeshu his mother, and the sister of his mother, and Mariam, she who was (the wife) of Cleopha, and Mariam Magdalitha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeshu seeth his mother, and that disciple whom he loved, standing; and he said to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and he said to that disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple received her to be with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>After these Jeshu knew that every thing would be accomplished, and, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And a vessel was set (there) filled with vinegar: then they filled a sponge from the vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and offered it to his mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Jeshu had taken the vinegar, he said, Behold, it is finished! And he bowed his head, and delivered up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>THE Jihudoyee, because it was the preparation, said, Let not these bodies remain-all-night upon the cross, because the shabath has lighted: for a great day was the day of that shabath. And they besought of Pilatos that they should break the legs of those (who had been) crucified, and take them down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the soldiers came, and brake the legs of the first, and of that other who was crucified with him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>but when they came unto Jeshu, they saw that he was dead already, and they brake not his legs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But one of the soldiers struck him in his side with the lance, and forthwith there came out blood and water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he who SAW testifieth, and the truth is his testimony; and he knoweth that the truth he hath said, that you also may believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said, that A bone shall not be broken in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And again another scripture which said, They shall look upon him whom they pierced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>After these Jauseph, he who was of Rometha, begged of Pilatos, for he was a disciple of Jeshu, but secretly for fear of the Jihudoyee, that he might take the body of Jeshu: and Pilatos permitted. And he came and took the body of Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Nikodimos also came, he who at first had come to Jeshu by night, and he brought with him a condiment of myrrh and aloes, as a hundred lithreen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they took the body of Jeshu, and wrapped it in cloths and in balsams, as is the manner of the Jihudoyee to bury.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now in that place where Jeshu was crucified was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre where one yet had not been laid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they laid there Jeshu, because the shabath was coming in and the sepulchre was near.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
