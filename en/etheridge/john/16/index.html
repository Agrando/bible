But these at first I did not tell you, because with you I was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now I go unto Him who sent me; and no man of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For I have told you these, and sorrow hath come and filled your hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But I the truth say to you, That it is needful for you that I go; for if I go not, the Paraclete cometh not to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he hath come, he will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Of sin, because they believe not in me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but of righteousness, because unto my Father I go, and you see me not again;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>but of judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I have yet much to tell you, but you cannot now apprehend;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but when the Spirit of Truth hath come, he will lead you into all the truth; for he will not speak of himself; but all that he shall hear he will speak, and the things to come will he make known to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me, because of mine he will take and will show you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>All whatever that the Father hath is mine: on this account I have said to you, That of mine he will take, and will show you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>A LITTLE (time), and you will not see me; and again a little, and you shall see me, because I go to the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the disciples said one to another, What is this that he saith to us? A little (time), and you will not see me; and again a little (while), and you shall see me, and because I go to my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they said, What is this little (time of) which he hath spoken?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We know not what he saith. But Jeshu knew that they sought to ask him; and he said to them, Concerning this do you inquire together that I told you, A little (time), and you will not see me; and again a little, and you shall see me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Amen, amen, I tell you, That you will weep and lament, and the world will rejoice; and to you shall be sorrow; but your sorrow shall become joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman, when she travaileth, hath sorrow, that the day hath come for her giving birth; but when she hath borne a son, she remembereth not her anguish, for joy that a child of man hath been born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You also now have sorrow; but again I will see you, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And in that day you will ask me nothing. Amen, amen, I tell you, That whatsoever you shall ask my Father in my name, he will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name: ask, and receive, that your joy may be full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>These in parables I have spoken with you; but the hour cometh when I will not speak with you in parables, but manifestly; and I will announce to you concerning the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you that I will ask of the Father for you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that from the Father I came forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I came forth from the Father, and came into the world; and again I leave the world, and go unto the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples say to him, Behold, now openly speakest thou, and not one parable hast thou spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now know we that every thing thou knowest, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that from Aloha thou hast come forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>JESHU saith to them, Believe!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, the hour shall come, and now cometh, that you will be dispersed (every) man to his place, and you will have left me alone. But I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>These have I said to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress; but be of heart, I have conquered the world.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
