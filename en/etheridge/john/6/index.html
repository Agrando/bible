And the men reclined, in number five thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jeshu took the bread, and blessed, and divided unto those who reclined, and likewise also of the fishes, as much as they willed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, Gather the fragments that abound, that nothing be lost;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and they gathered and filled twelve baskets of fragments, those which abounded unto them who had eaten of the five loaves of barley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But those men, when they had seen the sign which Jeshu had wrought, said, Truly this is the Prophet that cometh into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when Jeshu knew that they were about to come to seize him and make him the King, he passed away to a mountain alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>AND when it was eventide, his disciples went down to the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they sat in a vessel, and went over for Kapher-nachum. And it was dark, and Jeshu had not come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the sea had risen against them, because a great wind blew.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they had led stadia twentyfive or thirty, and they saw Jeshu walking upon the sea, and drawing nigh to the vessel; and they feared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Jeshu himself said to them, I am, fear not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they willed to receive him into the vessel, and soon that vessel was at that land to which they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The day after the people that stood on the opposite shore of the sea saw that there was not another vessel there except that into which the disciples had ascended, and that Jeshu had not entered with his disciples into the vessel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but there came other boats from Tiberios near the place, where they did eat bread when Jeshu had blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when that company saw that Jeshu was not there nor his disciples, they ascended into those boats, and came to Kapher-nachum. And they sought Jeshu;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and when they had found him on the opposite side of the sea, they say to him, Raban, when camest thou hither?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, Amen, amen, I tell you, You seek me, not because you considered the signs, but because you did eat the bread, and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Work not (for) the food which perisheth, but (for) the food that endureth unto the life that is eternal, which the Son of man shall give to you: for this hath the Father sealed, (even) Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They say to him, What shall we do that we may work the works of Aloha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, This is the work of Aloha, that you believe in Him whom he hath sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>THEY say to him, What sign doest thou that we may see, and believe in thee? What performest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers manna did eat in the desert, as it is written, that bread from heaven be gave them to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jeshu saith to them, Amen, amen, I tell you, That Musha gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>for the bread of Aloha is He who hath descended from heaven, and giveth life to the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They say to him, Our Lord, at all time give us this bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jeshu saith to them, I am the bread of life: he who cometh to me shall not hunger, and he who believeth in me shall not thirst, for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I have told you that you have seen me, and have not believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Every one whom the Father hath given me, unto me will come; and him who unto me shall come, I will not cast out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I descended from heaven not to do mine own will, but the will of Him who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But this is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all whom he hath given me I shall lose not of him, but shall raise him at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For this is the will of my Father, that every one who seeth the Son and believeth on him, shall have the life that is eternal, and I will raise him at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But the Jihudoyee murmured against him because he said, I am the bread which hath descended from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they said, Is not this Jeshu bar Jauseph, he whose father and mother we know? and how saith this, From heaven I have descended?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, Murmur not one with another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No man can come to me unless the Father who sent me shall attract him, and I will raise him at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the prophet, that they shall be all taught of Aloha: every one, therefore, who hath heard from the Father and learned of him, cometh unto me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>There is no man who hath seen the Father, but he who is from Aloha, he hath seen the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>AMEN, amen, I say to you, Whosoever believeth in me hath the life which is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers did eat manna in the desert, and are dead:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>but this is the bread which hath descended from heaven, that man may eat of it, and die not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the bread of life that from heaven hath descended; and if man shall eat of this bread, he shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my body, which for the life of the world I give.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>The Jihudoyee contended one with another, saying, How can this his body give to us to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And Jeshu said to them, Amen, amen, I tell you, That unless you eat the body of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He who eateth of my body, and drinketh of my blood, hath the life which is eternal, and I will raise him at the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my body is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>He who eateth my body, and drinketh my blood, abideth in me, and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>As the Father the Living (one) who hath sent me, and I live by the Father, even so he who shall eat me, shall live, too, by me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread which hath descended from heaven. Not as was the manna that your fathers ate, and are dead; he who eateth of this bread shall live for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>These things he spake in the synagogue, as he taught in Kapher-nachum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And many of his disciples who heard said, A hard word is this: who can hear it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>BUT Jeshu knew in himself that his disciples murmured concerning this; and he said to them, Does this stumble you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>If you shall see then the Son of man ascend up to the place where he was from the first?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>It is the Spirit that maketh alive, the body profiteth nothing: the words which I have spoken to you, they are spirit and they are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jeshu knew from the first who they were who believed not, and who it was who would betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And he said to them, On account of this I told you that no man can come to me, unless it be given him of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>On account of this word many of his disciples went back, and walked not with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Jeshu said to the twelve, Do you also will to go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Shemun Kipha answered and said, My Lord, unto whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and we believe and know that thou art the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha the Living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jeshu saith to them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and from you one is Satana?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>He spake concerning Jihuda bar Shemun Scarjuta; for he it was who would betray him, one from the twelve.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
