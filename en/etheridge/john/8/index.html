You judge carnally; but I judge no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Yet if I judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and my Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is truth:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I am (one) who testify of myself, and my Father who sent me testifieth (also) of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They say to him, Where is thy Father? Jeshu answered and said to them, You know neither me, nor my Father; for if me you had known, my Father also would you have known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>These words spake Jeshu in the house of treasure, as he taught in the temple: and no man apprehended him; for not yet had come his hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jeshu said again, I go, and you will seek me, and will die in your sins; and where I go you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Jihudoyee say, Will he kill himself then? for he saith, Whither I go you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to them, From beneath are you; but I am from above: you are of this world;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but I am not of this world. I said to you, that you will die in your sins: for if you believe not that I AM, you will die in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The Jihudoyee say, Who art thou? Jeshu saith to them, The same that I began to tell you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Much have I against you to say and to judge: but he who hath sent me is true; and those (things) which I have heard from him these speak I in the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But they knew not that of the Father he spake to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>JESHU saith to them again, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am (he), and (that) nothing from myself I do; but as the Father hath taught me, so I speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he who sent me is with me: my Father hath not left me alone; for whatever is pleasing to him I do at all time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And as these (words) he spake, many believed on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jeshu said to those Jihudoyee who believed on him, If you persevere in my doctrine, you shall be truly my disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and you shall know the truth, and the truth shall liberate you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They say to him, We are the seed of Abraham, and never service to man have we performed; how sayest thou that we shall be sons of freedom?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jeshu saith to them, Amen I tell you, Whoever doeth sin is the servant of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the servant abideth not for ever in the house, but the Son for ever abideth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If He therefore, the Son, shall liberate you, truly shall you be sons of freedom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I know that you are the seed of Abraham; but you seek to kill me, because in my word you do not concur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>That which I have seen with my Father I speak, and that which you have seen with your father you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>They answered and said to him, Our father is Abraham. Jeshu saith to them, If you were the sons of Abraham, the works of Abraham you would do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But now you seek to kill me, the man who the truth has spoken with you, which I have heard from Aloha. This Abraham did not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But you do the deeds of your father. They say to him, We from fornication are not; one Father have we, Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jeshu saith to them, If Aloha were your Father, you would love me; for I from Aloha came forth, and I came not of myself, but he sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Wherefore my word do you not acknowledge? Because you cannot hear my word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You are from your father the accuser, and the desires of your father you are willing to do. He from the beginning was the killer of men, and in the truth he stood not; therefore the truth is not in him. And when he speaketh a lie, of his own he speaketh, because of falsity he is also the father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I (speak the truth, and) because the truth I speak, you believe me not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who of you convicteth me of sin? Yet if the truth I speak, why do you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who is of Aloha the words of Aloha heareth: therefore you hear not, because you are not of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>The Jihudoyee answered and say to him, Did we not well say, Thou art a Shomroya, and hast a devil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jeshu said to them, I have no devil; but my Father I honour, and you debase me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I seek not my own glory; He is, who seeketh and judgeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Amen, amen, I say to you, That he who my word keepeth, death shall not see for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The Jihudoyee say to him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, that he who thy word keepeth, death shall not taste for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead; and than the prophets, who are dead? What makest thou thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jeshu said to them, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifieth me; he, of whom you say that he is your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But you know him not; but I know him: and should I say that I know him not, I should be a liar like you. But I know him, and keep his words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Abraham, your father, desired to see my day, and he saw, and was glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The Jihudoyee said to him, Yet the son of fifty years thou art not, and Abraham hast thou seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jeshu saith to them, Amen, amen, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I AM.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And they took up stones to stone him; but Jeshu concealed himself, and went from the temple, and passed among them, and went.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
