And he said, I am not. Art thou the Prophet? And he said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said to him, And who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He saith, I am the voice which crieth in the wilderness, Make plain the way of the Lord, as said Eshaia the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But they who were sent were from the Pharishee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they demanded and said to him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Meshicha, nor Elia, nor the Prophet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Juchanon answered and said to them, I baptize you with waters; but he standeth among you whom you know not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>he it is who cometh after me, and he was before me; he, the latchets of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things were done in Bethania, at the passage of the Jurdan, where Juchanon was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>AND the day after, Juchanon seeth Jeshu, who was coming to him; and he said, Behold the Lamb of Aloha, who beareth the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This is he concerning whom I said, After me cometh a man, and he was before me, because he is anterior to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I knew him not, but that he should be made known unto Isroel, therefore have I come with waters to baptize.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Juchanon testified and said, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven as a dove, and it remained upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I knew him not: but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me, He upon whom thou seest the Spirit descend and remain, this baptizeth with the Spirit of Holiness:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and I saw, and bare witness that this is the Son of Aloha</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the day after Juchanon stood, and two of his disciples;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and, contemplating Jeshu as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of Aloha!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And his two disciples heard him as he spake, and they went after Jeshu.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jeshu turned (himself), and saw them coming after him, and said to them, Whom seek you? They say to him, Raban, where dwellest thou?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He saith to them, Come and see. And they went and saw where he dwelt; and they were with him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now one of those who heard Juchanon and went after Jeshu, was Andreas, the brother of Shemun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>This saw first Shemun his brother, and said to him, We have found the Meshicha;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and he brought him to Jeshu. And Jeshu saw him, and said, Thou art Shemun bar Jona; thou shalt be called Kipha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>AND the day following Jeshu willed to go forth into Galila. And he found Philipos, and said to him, Come after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now Philipos was from Beth-tsaida, from the city of Andreas and of Shemun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philipos found Nathanael, and said to him, Him of whom Musha in the law, and the prophets, did write we have found, (and) that Jeshu (is) he, the son of Jauseph who is from Natsrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Saith to him Nathanael, From Natsrath can any good thing be? Philipos saith to him, Come and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Jeshu saw Nathanael as he was coming to him, and said of him, Behold truly a son of Isroel who hath no guile in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jeshu saith to him, While yet Philipos had not called thee, while thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabi, thou art the Son of Aloha himself, thou art the very King of Isroel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jeshu saith to him, Upon my telling thee that I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Greater things than these thou shalt see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He saith to him, Amen, amen, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see the heavens opened, and the angels of Aloha ascending and descending unto the Son of man.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
