And he went, washed, and came seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But his neighbours, and they who had seen (him) aforetime as he begged, said, Is not this he who sat and begged?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Some said, It is he; and some said, It is not, but one like him; but he said, I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They say to him, How were thine eyes opened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He answered and said to them, The man whose name is Jeshu made clay, and rubbed upon mine eyes, and said to me, Go, wash in the waters of Shilucha; and I went, washed, and received sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They say to him, Where is he? He saith to them, I know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought him who from the beginning was blind to the Pharishee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now it was shabath when Jeshu made the clay and opened his eyes:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and again the Pharishee questioned him, How didst thou receive sight? He said to them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and received sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And some of the Pharishee said, This man is not from Aloha; for the shabath he keepeth not. But others said, How can a man, a sinner, perform these signs? And there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They say again to the blind, What sayest thou concerning him, because he hath opened thine eyes? He saith to them, I say that he is the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But believed not concerning him the Jihudoyee that blind he had been and made-to-see, until they called the parents of him who had been made to see,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and asked them, If this is your son who, you say, was born blind, how now doth he see?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His parents answered and said, We know that this (is) our son, and that blind he was born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But how he now seeth, or who hath opened his eyes, we know not. He also hath entered on his years, ask him: he for himself shall speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>These words said his parents, because they feared the Jihudoyee; for the Jihudoyee had determined that if any man should confess him that he was the Meshicha, they would cast him out of the synagogue:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>on this account said his parents, He hath entered on his years, ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they called the second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, Glorify Aloha: for we know that this man is a sinner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He answered and said to them, Whether he be a sinner, I know not; but one (thing) I know, that I have been blind, and now, behold, I see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They say to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he to thee thine eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He saith to them, I told you, and you heard not: what will you hear? Are you also willing disciples to him to become?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But they reviled him, and said to him, Thou art the disciple of him; but we are the disciples of Musha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And we know that with Musha Aloha spake; but for this, we know not whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Answered the man and said to them, At this then we must wonder, that you know not from whence he is, and (yet) mine eyes he hath opened!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But we know that Aloha the voice of sinners heareth not; but if any man fear him and do his will, him he heareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>From of old it hath not been heard that a man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this were not from Aloha, he could not this have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and say to him, Thou altogether wast born in sins, and art thou teaching us? And they cast him without.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jeshu heard that they had cast him without, and he found him, and said to him, Dost thou believe on the Son of Aloha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He who had been cured answered and said, Who (is he), my Lord, that I may believe in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jeshu said to him, Thou hast SEEN him, and He who talketh with thee is He.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>He said, I believe, my Lord! And, falling, he adored him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jeshu said to them, For the judgment of this world am I come, that they who see not may see, and they who see may be made blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And some of the Pharishee who were with him heard these (words), and they said to him, Are we blind also?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jeshu saith to them, If blind you were, you would have no sin; but now you say, We see: therefore your sin is confirmed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
