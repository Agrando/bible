But no man of you keepeth the law. Why seek you to kill me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The people answered, saying, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, One work have I performed, and all of you wondered on this account.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Musha gave you circumcision, not because it was from the fathers, and on the shabath you circumcise a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But if a man is circumcised on the day of shabath because the law of Musha may not be broken, why against me do you murmur, because I have altogether healed a man on the day of shabath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Judge not with acceptance of persons, but righteous judgment judge you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And some of Urishlem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and, behold, openly he discourseth, and nothing say they to him. Do the elders know that this is truly the Meshicha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yet of this we know from whence he is; but when the Meshicha cometh, no man knoweth from whence he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Jeshu lifted up his voice as he taught in the temple, and said, You know me, and from whence I am you know: and of myself I am not come; but true is he who sent me, he whom you know not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I know him who am from him; and he hath sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they sought to apprehend him; but no man laid hands on him, because not yet was come his hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many of the multitude believed in him, and said, When the Meshicha is come, will he exceed the miracles which this doeth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharishee heard the assembly, that they said these things of him, and the chief priests sent officers to apprehend him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Jeshu said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him who sent me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and you will seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am you cannot come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Jihudoyee say among themselves, Whither is this about to go, that we cannot find him? To the countries of the nations is he to go, and to teach the Heathens?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What is this word he hath said, You shall seek me, and not find me; and where I am you cannot come?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>BUT in the great day, which was the last of the feast, stood Jeshu and cried, and said, If (any) man thirst, let him come unto me and drink;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>for whosoever believeth in me, as have said the scriptures, rivers of living waters shall flow from his belly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But this he spake of the Spirit which they should receive who believe in him. For not yet was the Spirit given, because not yet was Jeshu glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now many of the assemblies who heard his words said, This is truly the Prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others said, This is the Meshicha. Others said, How from Galila cometh the Meshicha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Hath not the scripture said, That from the seed of David, and from Beth-lechem the town of David, cometh the Meshicha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there was a division concerning him among the assemblies;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and there were men of them who would have apprehended him; but no man laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>AND those officers came to the chief priests and the Pharishee; and the priests said to them, Why have you not brought him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers say to them, Never so spake a son of man as speaks this man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The Pharishee say to them, Are you also deceived?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Have any of the heads, or of the Pharishee, believed in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But if this people who know not the law (believe in him), they are accursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>One of them, Nikodimos, he who came to Jeshu by night, saith to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Does our law condemn a man unless it shall hear from him first, and know what he hath done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, Art thou also of Galila? Investigate, and see, that the Prophet from Galila ariseth not.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
