And Jeshu walked in the temple in the portico of Shelumun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Jihudoyee surrounded him, saying to him, How long takest thou our souls? If thou art the Meshicha, tell us openly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jeshu answered and said to them, I have told you, and you believe not. The works that I do in the name of my Father, these witness for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you believe not, because you are not of my sheep, (even) as I told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and I give to them the life which is eternal, and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall snatch them from my hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For my Father who gave them to me than all is greater; and no man from the hand of my Father can snatch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I and my Father are One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again the Jihudoyee took up stones to stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jeshu saith to them, Many good works from my Father have I showed you: on account of which of these works do you stone me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jihudoyee say to him, Not on account of the good works do we stone thee, but because thou blasphemest; thou, being a son of man, making thyself Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jeshu saith to them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are Alohee?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If them he calleth Alohee, because with them was the word of Aloha, and the scripture cannot be loosed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>to him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, say you, Thou blasphemest, because I have said to you, I am the Son of Aloha?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And if I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but if I do, though you believe not me, the works believe, that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and (that) I (am) in the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they sought again to apprehend him; but he went forth from among their hands:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and he went beyond Jurdan, to the place where Juchanon at first had baptized, and was there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to him, and said, Juchanon did not one sign; but every thing which Juchanon said concerning this man was true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed in him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
