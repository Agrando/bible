Then will there be praise to each man from Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>BUT these things, my brethren, for your sakes I have applied to the person of myself and of Apolo, that through us you may learn not to think of us beyond what is written; and that one above his neighbour may not be exalted on account of any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who distinguisheth thee? Or, what hast thou which thou hast not received? And if thou hast received, why dost thou boast as if thou hadst not received?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now you are satiated, and are rich, and without us have reigned. But I would that you did reign, that we might also reign with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I consider that us, the apostles, Aloha hath set last, as unto death, to be a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are fools for the sake of the Meshiha, but we are wise in the Meshiha; we are the weak, but you are the mighty; you are glorified, and we abased.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Until this hour we hunger and thirst, we are naked and beaten and have no fixed dwelling;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and we labour, working with our hands. They revile us, and we bless; they persecute us, and we endure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>they maltreat us, and we pray for them; as the refuse of the world are we made and the execration of all men until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Not as to shame you write I these things, but as my beloved children I admonish (you).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if you have ten thousand teachers in the Meshiha, yet not many fathers; for in Jeshu Meshiha I have begotten you through the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I entreat then of you that you be like me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>WHEREFORE I have sent to you Timotheos, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, that he may remind you of my ways in the Meshiha, according to that which I teach in all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as if I were not coming to you, some of you are inflated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But if the Lord will, quickly come I unto you; and I will know not the words of them who exalt themselves, but their power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of Aloha is not in word, but in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How are you willing? with a rod shall I come to you, or with love and with the spirit of kindliness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
