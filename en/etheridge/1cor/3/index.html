For while there are among you envy and contentions and divisions, are you not carnal, and walking in the flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For while some of you say, I am of Paulos, and another, I am of Apollo, are you not carnal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For who is Paulos, or who Apollo, but ministers by whom you have believed and each as the Lord gave to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I have planted, and Apollo watered, but Aloha made to increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He then who planteth is not any thing nor he who watereth; but Aloha who maketh to increase.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he who planteth and he who watereth are one, (and) each according to his labour his recompence receiveth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For with Aloha we work; and the work of Aloha and the edifice of Aloha are you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And according to the grace of Aloha which is given to me, I have laid the foundation as a wise architect; but another hath built upon it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But let every man beware how he buildeth upon it. For another foundation besides this which is laid no man can lay, (that, namely,) which is Jeshu the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if any man build upon this foundation gold, or silver, or precious stones; or wood, or hay, or stubble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>the work of every one shall be revealed, for that day shall reveal it; for by the fire shall it be revealed, and the work of every man as it is the fire shall distinguish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he whose work which he builded shall abide, will receive his recompense;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and he whose work shall be burned, shall fail; but he (himself) shall be rescued, but so as from fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>KNOW YOU not that you are the temple of Aloha, and (that) the Spirit of Aloha inhabiteth in you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Whoso destroyeth the temple of Aloha, him will Aloha destroy for the temple of Aloha is holy, which you are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let no man deceive himself.
