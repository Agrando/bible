And if the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now hath Aloha set all the members severally in the body as he willed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But if all were one member, where would be the body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now the members are many, but the body one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The eye is not able to say to the hand, Thou art not needful to me; nor is the hand able to say to the feet, You are not needful to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But those members which are considered to be feeble, of them is the more especial need;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and those which we consider contemptible in the body, to these the more we increase the honour; and on those which are of shame we bestow the greater decoration.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But those members that are honourable in us have no need of adornment: but Aloha hath contempered the body, and given the more honour to the member which is inconsiderable;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>that there should be no divisions in the body, but all the members equally one of the other should have care:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>as that when one member shall be diseased, all may suffer; and if one member be glorified, all the members may be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But you are the body of the Meshiha, and members in your place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>FOR Aloha hath placed in the church, first, apostles; after them, prophets; after them, teachers; after them, workers of miracles; after them, gifts of healing, and helpers, and leaders, and kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all workers of miracles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Have all the gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues, or do all interpret?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if you are emulous of great gifts, I will yet show you a way more admirable.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
