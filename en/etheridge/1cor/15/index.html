But when he saith that every thing is subjected to him, it is evident that (it is) with the exception of him who hath subjected to him all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when all shall have been subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to him who had made subject to him all, that Aloha may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead arise not? Why are they baptized for the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why also every hour are we standing in peril?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I asseverate, by your glorying, my brethren, which is mine in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, that daily I die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If as among men I have been thrown to beasts at Ephesus, what have I profited if the dead do not arise? Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Mistake not; for Evil narrations corrupt well-disposed minds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>AWAKEN your hearts rightly, and sin not; for there are some who have not the knowledge of Aloha; to your shame I say it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Some one of you will say, How arise the dead, and with what body come they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Fool, the seed which thou sowest, unless it die, lives not:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and that thing which thou sowest is not the body that is to be, but thou sowest naked grain, of wheat, or of barley, or of the rest of seeds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>but Aloha giveth it a body as he willeth, and to each of the seeds a body of its own nature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For every body is not alike: for there is one body of man, and another of the beast, and another of the fowl, and another of fishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There are heavenly bodies, and there are earthly bodies; but one is the glory of the heavenly, and another of the earthly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; and star excelleth star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So also is the life of the dead. They are sown in corruption, they arise without corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>They are sown in baseness, they arise in glory. They are sown in weakness, they arise in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown an animal body, it ariseth a body spiritual. For there is a body of the animal, and there is a body of the spirit;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>as also it is written, Adam the first man became a living soul, and the last Adam a life-giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But the spiritual was not first, but the animal; and then the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man who is of the earth is dust, the second man the Lord from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As was he who was dust, so also are they who are dust: as is he who is from heaven, so also are the heavenly ones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And as we have worn the likeness of him who was dust, so shall we wear the likeness of him who is from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But this I say, my brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; nor doth corruption inherit incorruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I tell you the mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we all shall be changed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>suddenly, as in the twinkling of the eye, at the last trumpet, while it calleth; and the dead will arise without corruption, and we shall be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For this which is corruptible shall put on incorruption, and likewise (this) which dieth shall put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But when this which is corruptible shall put on incorruptibleness, and this which dieth, immortality, then shall be done that word which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Where is thy sting, Death? and where is thy victory Shiul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But the sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks be to Aloha, who giveth us the victory by the hand of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Wherefore, my brethren, my beloved, be steadfast, be not moved, but be abounding in all time in the work of the Lord, while you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
