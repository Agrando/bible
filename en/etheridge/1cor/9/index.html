Behold, the law also saith these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For it is written in the law of Musha, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out (the corn). But of oxen is Aloha careful?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But it is evident that on our account this is said; for on our account it is written, because that in hope it behoveth the ploughman to plough, and him who thresheth, in hope of provision (to thresh).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If we of the spirit have sown among you, is it a great thing if we from you of the body shall reap?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if others have this power over you, much more have we. But we are not used in this power; but we bear all, lest in any thing we should hinder the gospel of the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>KNOW you not that they who serve in the sanctuary from the sanctuary are sustained? And they who at the altar serve share with the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So also our Lord hath commanded, that they who his gospel preach, by his gospel shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I am not used in one of these; nor on this account have I thus written, that so it should be done unto me: for it were better for me that dying I should die, than that any man my glorying should make void.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yet also in preaching I have no cause to glory: for necessity lieth upon me; for woe to me unless I preach!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if with my will I do this, I have a reward. But if without my will, (yet) a stewardship is confided to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>What, then, is my reward? That while preaching without expenses I may perform the annunciation of the Meshiha, and not abuse the power that is given to me in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For while free of all men, to all men I subject myself, that the many I may gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I become with the Jihudoyee as a Jihudoya, that the Jihudoyee I may gain; and with them who are under the law, I become as one under the law, that them who are under the law I may gain;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and to those who have not the law I become as one without law, while I am not unto Aloha without law, but in the law of the Meshiha, that them also who have not law I may gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I become with the weak as weak, that the weak I may gain. To all men all become I, that every man I may save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But this I do that I may be a participator in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Know you not, that they who run in the course, run all, but one taketh to him the victory? So run, that you may take hold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For every man who contendeth from every thing (besides with) holdeth his mind; and they who run (do it) that they may receive a crown that is corruptible, but we one that is incorruptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I therefore so run, not as about a thing unknown; and so smite I, as not smiting the air;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>but my body I subdue and make subservient, lest when to others I shall have preached, I my very self shall be rejected.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
