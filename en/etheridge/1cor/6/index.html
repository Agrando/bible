And if the world by you is judged, are you not worthy to judge small matters?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Know you not that you are to judge angels? How much more those (matters) which are of this world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But if you have matters to be judged regarding the world, those who are little-esteemed in the church make you to sit in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But to your reproach am I to say to you, So there is not among you even one wise man, who is able to adjust between a brother and his brother?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But a brother with his brother litigates, and, moreover, before those who are unbelievers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now, therefore, you make yourselves guilty while you have litigation one with another. For why do you not bear injury? and why do you not suffer fraud?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you injure, and you defraud, also your brethren!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Or, know you not that the unjust the kingdom of Aloha cannot inherit? Do not err; neither fornicators, nor the servers of idols, nor adulterers, nor corrupters, nor liers with men, nor the oppressive,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor the rapacious, the kingdom of Aloha can inherit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And these were some of you but you are washed, and sanctified, and justified in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and by the Spirit of our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>ALL (food) is lawful to me, but all is not expedient for me. All is lawful to me, but over me no one shall have power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Food is for the belly, and the belly for food; but Aloha will abolish them both. But the body was not for fornication, but for our Lord, and our Lord for the body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Aloha hath raised up our Lord, and us will raise by his power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Know you not that your bodies are members of the Meshiha? Shall one take a member of the Meshiha to make it a member of a harlot? Never!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Know you not that whosoever attacheth to a harlot is one body? For it is said, The two shall be one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But, he who attacheth to our Lord is with him one spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Flee from fornication: for every sin which a man committeth is without his body; but he who committeth fornication against his own body sinneth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Or, know you not that your body is the temple of the Spirit of Holiness, who dwelleth in you, (even) Him whom you have received from Aloha? And you are not your own,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for you are bought with the price; therefore glorify Aloha in your body and in your spirit, which are of Aloha.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
