For greater is he who prophesieth than he who speaketh with tongues, unless he interpret. But if he interpret, he edifieth the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now, my brethren, if I come to you and speak with you in tongues, what do I profit you, unless I speak with you, or by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by doctrine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For those also which have no life in them, and give voice, whether pipe or harp, if distinction be not made between a tone and its fellow, how can it be known what is sung, or what is played?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And if the trumpet call a voice which is not distinguished, who will prepare for the battle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So you also, if you speak the word in a tongue, and there be no interpretation, how will it be known what you say? Will you not be as if speaking with the air?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For, behold, there are many kinds of tongues in the world, and not one of them hath not signification;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>but if I do not know the power of the voice, I become as a barbarian to him who speaks, and he also who speaks is a barbarian to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So also you, while you are emulous of the gifts of the Spirit for the edification of the church, seek that you may excel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And let him who speaketh with tongues pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I am praying in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my mind is without fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>What shall I do then? I will pray with my spirit, and I will pray with my mind; and I will sing with my spirit, and I will sing with my mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Otherwise, if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he who filleth the place of the unlearned say Amen to thy thanksgiving? for he knoweth not what thou sayest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For thou blessest well, but thy neighbour is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I praise Aloha that more than all of you I speak with tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that others also may learn, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>MY brethren, be not children in your minds, but in evils be you babes, and in your minds be perfect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written, In a strange language and in another tongue Will I speak with this people; Yet so will they not hear me, saith the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Hence, tongues are appointed for a sign, not to the believing, but to those who believe not: but prophecy, not for those who believe not, but for those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If then all the church be assembled, and all of you speak with tongues, and the ignorant, or those who believe not enter, will they not say you are insane?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And if all should prophesy, and there come in to you the ignorant, or of those who believe not, he is convicted by you all, and reproved by you all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and the secrets of his heart are revealed; and then will he fall upon his face and worship Aloha, and say, Truly Aloha is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I say then, my brethren, that when you are assembled, if any one of you hath a psalm, let him speak; and (so too) he who hath doctrine, and he who hath a revelation, and he who hath a tongue, and he who hath the interpretation: let all be done unto edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if with a tongue any one speak, two shall speak, or at most three, and each shall (separately) speak, and one interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And if there be no one who interpreteth, let him who speaketh with a tongue be silent in the church, and between himself and Aloha let him speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the rest discern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if to another be revealed while sitting, let the first be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For one by one you can all prophesy, that each may learn, and each be edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For the spirit of the prophets to the prophets is subject.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Because Aloha is not of tumult, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>LET your women in the church be silent; for it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be subject, as also saith the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if any wish to learn, in their houses let them ask their husbands; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Was it from you that the word of Aloha went forth? Or did it come only to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But if any man of you think that he is a prophet, or that he is spiritual, let him acknowledge these which I write to you to be the commandments of our Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if any man know not, let him not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Be emulous, therefore, my brethren, to prophesy, and to speak with tongues forbid not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but let every thing be done with decency and in order.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
