Or do you despise the church of Aloha, and shame those who have nothing to eat? What do I say to you? Do I praise you in this? I praise you not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>FOR I received from our Lord that which I have delivered unto you: that our Lord Jeshu in that night when he was betrayed took bread;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and he blessed and brake, and said, Take, eat, this (is) my body which for you is broken: so do to my remembrance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise after they had supped he gave also the cup, and said, This cup is the new covenant in my blood; so do, whensoever you shall drink (it) to my remembrance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For whensoever you eat this bread, and drink this cup, the death of our Lord you commemorate until his advent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Whoever then eateth of the bread of the Lord, and drinketh of his cup, and is not worthy of it, is guilty of the blood of the Lord and of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>On this account a man should prove himself, and then eat of this bread, and drink of this cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For whoever eateth and drinketh of it while not worthy, condemnation to himself he eateth and drinketh, because he hath not distinguished the body of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>On this account many among you are sick and infirm, and many who sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For if we judge ourselves, we shall not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But when we are judged of our Lord, we are chastised, that not with the world we might be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Wherefore, my brethren, when you assemble to eat, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But whoever hungereth, in his (own) house let him feed; that you may not assemble unto condemnation. Concerning the rest, when I come I will direct you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
