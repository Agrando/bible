If any man confide in himself that he is of the Meshiha, let this one know of himself, that as he is of the Meshiha, so also are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if I should boast somewhat more of the authority which our Lord hath given me, I should not blush; because for your edification he gave it to me, and not for your destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I insist not, that I may not be considered as one who would terrify you by my epistles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For there are men who say, His epistles are weighty and forcible; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he who after this manner speaks, shall conclude that what we are by the word of our epistle when absent, so are we in the deed when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we dare not value or compare ourselves with those who glorify themselves; but because they compare themselves with themselves, they do not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For we do not boast beyond our measure, but in the measure of the boundary which Aloha hath apportioned to us, that we might come also unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For it is not as not reaching to you we extend ourselves; for unto you we come with the gospel of the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Neither boast we beyond our measure in the labour of others; but we have hope, that with the increase of your faith, we shall be enlarged according to our measure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and be progressive also beyond you to evangelize. Not as within the measure of others in the things that are prepared will we glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But let him who glorieth glory in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For it is not he who glorifieth himself who is approved, but he who is glorified of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
