For he told us of your love toward us, and of your lamentation and your zeal on our behalf. And when I heard, my joy was great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For though I grieved you in an epistle, I repent me not, though I did repent. For I perceive how that epistle, though for an hour, did make you sorry;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but now I exercise joy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow hath brought you to repentance. For you were sorry towards Aloha; so that in nothing will you suffer loss from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the sorrow that is for the sake of Aloha worketh soul-penitence, which turneth not and converteth, unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For, behold, (in) this very (case) that you were made contrite for the sake of Aloha; what carefulness it wrought in you, and vindication, and displeasure, and fear, and love, and zeal, and punishment! And by every thing have you shown yourselves to be pure in this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But, it was for this we wrote to you; not on account of the injurer, nor on account of the injured one, but that you may know before Aloha our carefulness over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this cause we were consoled, and with our consolation more abundantly did we rejoice in the joy of Titos; because his spirit had been refreshed with you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Because in whatever I had boasted to him concerning you, I have not been ashamed; but, as of every thing we had spoken truth with you, so also our boasting unto Titos hath been found in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And his affection is greatly enlarged toward you, when he remembers your obedience; because with fear and with trembling you received him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I rejoice that in every thing I can confide in you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
