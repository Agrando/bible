or are they things of the flesh that I purpose, that I should have in them Yes, yes, or No, no?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Faithful is Aloha that our word with you was not Yes and No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of Aloha, Jeshu Meshiha, who by us hath been preached unto you, by me and by Sylvanas and by Timotheos, was not Yes and No, but it was Yes in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For all the promises of Aloha in him, in the Meshiha, are Yes; for which by him we give Amen to the glory of Aloha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Aloha himself confirmeth us with you in the Meshiha, who himself hath anointed us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and hath sealed us, and given us the earnest-pledge of his Spirit in our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>BUT I testify to Aloha on my soul that because I am sparing of you, I have not come to Kurinthos.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not because we are lords of your faith, but are helpers of your joy; for by faith you stand.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
