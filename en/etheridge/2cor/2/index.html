But I confide in you, that my joy is that of all of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And from great affliction and anxiety of heart I wrote those things to you with many tears, not that you might grieve, but (also) that you might know the abundant love I have towards you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if any one hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me (only), but a part of you all: that the word may not weigh upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But sufficient for him was this chastisement, which was from many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now on the other hand it behoves you to forgive him and console him, lest he who is such an one be swallowed up of excessive grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore I entreat of you to confirm to him your love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>On this account also I have written, to ascertain by experiment whether in every thing you will obey me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But to whom you forgive, I also. For I, too, what I have forgiven, have on your account forgiven in the presence of the Meshiha:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>lest Satana get the advantage of you; for we know his devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>WHEN, in preaching the gospel of the Meshiha, I had come to Troas, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I had no rest in my spirit because I found not Titos my brother. But leaving them, I went forth to Makedunia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But thanks unto Aloha, who in all time maketh us a triumph in the Meshiha, and maketh manifest by us the perfume of his knowledge in every place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are a fragrant perfume in the Meshiha unto Aloha in those who are saved, and in those who perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To these as a perfume of death unto death, and to those as a perfume of life unto life. And unto these who is equal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For we are not as the rest who commix the word of Aloha; but as in truth, and as from Aloha, before Aloha in the Meshiha do we speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
