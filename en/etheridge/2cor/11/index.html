Aloha himself knoweth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I do this, and also will do it, to cut off the occasion of them who seek an occasion, that in the thing in which they boast they may be found as we are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For these are apostles of falsehood and workers of deceits, assimilating themselves to the apostles of the Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Nor in this may we wonder, if Satana himself be transformed into an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor is it a great thing if his ministers also are transformed into ministers of righteousness;-whose end will be according to their works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>BUT I say again, Let no man think of me as a fool; or if otherwise, let him receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The thing which I (now) speak, I do not speak in our Lord, but as in foolishness in this place of boasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because many boast in the flesh, I also will boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For you are content to listen to the feebleminded, you yourselves being wise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are ruled by one who subjugates you, and by one who devours you, and by one who takes away from you, and by one who exalts himself over you, and by one who smites you on your faces!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>As in abasement I speak; as though we were weak through defectiveness of mind, I speak. In whatever any man dareth, I also dare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>If they are Ebroyee, so am I; if they are Isroloyee, so am I; if they are the seed of Abraham, so am I;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>if they are ministers of the Meshiha,-I speak with defectiveness of mind,-I exceed then! In labours I exceed them, in stripes I exceed them, in chains I exceed them, in deaths many times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From the Jihudoyee, five times, forty (stripes) wanting one have I devoured;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>three times with staves have I been beaten, once was I stoned, three times have I been in shipwreck, a day and a night without a ship have I been in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>In journeys many, in danger of rivers, in danger of robbers, in danger from my own race, in danger from the Gentiles; I have been in danger in cities, I have been in danger in the waste, in danger by sea, in danger from false brethren;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>in labour and weariness, in much watching, in hunger and thirst, in much fasting, in cold and in nakedness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>besides the aboundings and the gathering which are upon me daily even my care which is for all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I must boast in my infirmities, I will boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Aloha, the Father of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, the Blessed for ever and ever, knoweth that I lie not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Darmsuk the great force of Aretos the king kept the city of the Darmsukoyee to apprehend me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And from a window in a basket they sent me from the wall, and I was delivered from his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
