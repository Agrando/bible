For we are careful for the things which are comely, not only before Aloha, but also before men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we have also sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved in many to be diligent; but now still more diligent from the great confidence he hath concerning you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Whether, then, (you regard) Titos, he is my companion and helper among you, or the other brethren, they are the apostles of the churches of the glory of Meshiha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wherefore the demonstration of your love, and of our boasting concerning you in these, make manifest in the sight of all the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
