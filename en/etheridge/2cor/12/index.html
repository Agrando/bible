Gladly therefore will I boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Meshiha may overshadow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For this cause I am willing in infirmities, in reviling, in affliction, in persecutions, in distresses, for the sake of the Meshiha; for when I am weak, then am I strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Behold, I have been deficient in mind in my boasting, because you have constrained me; for you were debtors to bear witness concerning me; because in nothing am I less than those apostles who are the most eminent, nevertheless I am not any thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The signs of the apostles I have wrought among you in all patience, and with mighty acts and miracles and with powers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For in what have you been less than the other churches, except in this, that I have not burdened you? Forgive me this offence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, this is three times that I prepare to come to you, and not to burden you; for I seek not yours, but you. For the children ought not to lay up treasures for the parents, but the parents for their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I gladly the expenses will spend, and also myself will I give for the sake of your souls: though, while the more I love you, you the less love me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, perhaps, (though) I did not burden you, yet (it may be said), as a crafty man with deceit I have robbed you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By any other whom I have sent to you have I made prey of you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Of Titos I requested, and sent with him the brethren. In any thing has Titos made prey of you? Have we not walked in one spirit, and in the same steps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>DO you again consider that we apologize to you? Before Aloha in the Meshiha do we speak; and all, my beloved, for the sake of your up-building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I fear lest, when I come to you, I should not find you as I wish, but should find you what you would not wish: lest there be contention and envy, and wrath and angry talk, and accusations and murmurings, and pompousness and agitation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and lest, when I come to you, my God may humiliate me, and I may have to lament over many who have sinned, and have not repented of the uncleanness and of the fornication and of the lasciviousness which they have committed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
