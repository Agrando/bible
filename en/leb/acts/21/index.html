And after falling to our knees on the beach and praying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>we said farewell to one another and embarked in the ship, and they returned to their own homes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had completed the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais. And after we greeted the brothers, we stayed one day with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And on the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(˻Now this man had˼ four virgin daughters who prophesied.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And while we were staying there many days, a certain prophet ˻named˼ Agabus came down from Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he came to us and took Paul’s belt. Tying up his own feet and hands, he said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man whose belt this is, and will deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when we heard these things, both we and the local residents urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Paul replied, “What are you doing weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be tied up, but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And because he would not be persuaded, we remained silent, saying, “The will of the Lord be done.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So after these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And some of the disciples from Caesarea also traveled together with us, bringing us to a certain Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple of long standing, with whom we were to be entertained as guests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when we came to Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And on the next day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And after greeting them, he began to relate ˻one after the other˼the things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they heard this, they began to glorify God. And they said to him, “You see, brother, how many ten thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and they are all zealous adherents of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they have been informed about you that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles the abandonment of Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to live according to our customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What then ˻is to be done˼? Doubtless they will all hear that you have come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore do this that we tell you: ˻we have˼ four men who have taken a vow on themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Take these menand purify yourself along with them and ˻pay their expenses˼ so that they can shave their heads, and everyone will know that the things which they had been informed about you are nothing, but you yourself also agree with observing the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have written a letter after deciding they should avoid food sacrificed to idols and blood and what has been strangled and sexual immorality.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took along the men on the next day, andafter he had purified himself together with them, he entered into the temple courts, announcing the completion of the days of purification until ˻the time˼ the offering would be presented on behalf of each one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia who had seen him in the temple courts stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>shouting, “Israelite men, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place! And furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they thought that Paul had brought into the temple.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the whole city was stirred up, and the people came running together, and they seized Paul and dragged him outside of the temple courts, and immediately the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they were seeking to kill him, a report came up to the military tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>˻He˼ immediately took along soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the military tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the military tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was and what it was that he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But some in the crowd were shouting one thing and others another, and because he was not able to find out the truth on account of the commotion, he gave orders to bring him into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he came to the steps, it happened that he had to be carried by the soldiers on account of the violence of the crowd,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for the crowd of people was following them, shouting, “Away with him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And as he was about to be brought into the barracks, Paul said to the military tribune, “Is it permitted for me to say something to you?” And he said, “Do you know Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then you are not the Egyptian who before these days raised a revolt and led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, “I am a Jewish man from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no unimportant city. Now I ask you, allow me to speak to the people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when he permitted him, Paul, standing there on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Aramaic language, saying,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
