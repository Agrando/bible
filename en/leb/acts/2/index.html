Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with deeds of power and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>this man, delivered up by the determined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed by nailing to a cross through the hand of lawless men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God raised ˻him˼ up, having brought to an end the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says with reference to him,‘I saw the Lord before me ˻continually˼,for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For this reason my heart was gladand my tongue rejoiced greatly,furthermore also my flesh will live in hope,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because you will not abandon my soul in Hades,nor will you permit your Holy One to experience decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have made known to me the paths of life;you will fill me with gladness with your presence.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>“Men and brothers, it is possible to speak with confidence to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us until this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat ˻one of his descendants˼ on his throne,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>by having foreseen this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was he abandoned in Hades nor did his flesh experience decay.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore, having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out this that you both see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.” ’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt, that God has made him both Lord and Christ—this Jesus whom you crucified!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the other apostles, “What should we do, men and brothers?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all those who are far away, as many as the Lord our God calls to himself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words he solemnly urged and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this crooked generation!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So those who accepted his message were baptized, and on that day about three thousand souls were added.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they were devoting themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were being performed by the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And all who believed were in the same place, and had everything in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And they began selling their possessions and property, and distributing these things to all, to the degree that anyone had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And every day, devoting themselves to meeting with one purpose in the temple courts and breaking bread from house to house, they were eating their food with joy and simplicity of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding every day to the total of those who were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
