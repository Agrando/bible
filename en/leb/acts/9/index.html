And leading him by the hand, they brought him into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he was ˻unable to see˼for three days, and he did not eat or drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus ˻named˼ Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias!” And he said, “Behold, here I am, Lord!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Lord said to him, “Get up, go to the street called ‘Straight’ and in the house of Judas look for ˻a man named Saul from Tarsus˼. For behold, he is praying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and he has seen in a vision a man ˻named˼ Ananias coming in and placing his hands on him so that he may regain his sight.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But Ananias replied, “Lord, I have heard from many people about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and here he has authority from the chief priests to tie up all who call upon your name!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But the Lord said to him, “Go, because this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Ananias departed and entered into the house, and placing his hands on him, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes and he regained his sight and got up and was baptized,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and after taking food, he regained his strength. And he was with the disciples in Damascus several days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately he began proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues: “This one is the Son of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all who heard him were amazed, and were saying, “Is this not the one who was wreaking havoc in Jerusalem on those who call upon this name, and had come here for this reason, that he could bring them tied up to the chief priests?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Saul was increasing in strength even more, and was confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this one is the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when many days had elapsed, the Jews plotted to do away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But their plot became known to Saul, and they were also watching the gates both day and night so that they could do away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But his disciples took him at night and let him down through the wall by lowering him in a basket.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he arrived in Jerusalem, he was attempting to associate with the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe that he was a disciple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he was going in and going out among them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he was speaking and debating with the ˻Greek-speaking Jews˼, but they were trying to do away with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when the brothers found out, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the church throughout all of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being strengthened. And living in the fear of the Lord and the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it was increasing in numbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now it happened that as Peter was traveling through all the places, he also came down to the saints who lived in Lydda.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he found there a certain man ˻named˼ Aeneas who was paralyzed, who had been lying on a mat for eight years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Get up and make your bed yourself!” And immediately he got up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him, who all indeed turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now in Joppa there was a certain female disciple ˻named˼ Tabitha (which translated means “Dorcas”). She was full of good deeds and charitable giving which she was constantly doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now it happened that in those days after becoming sick, she died. And after washing her, they placed her in an upstairs room.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, when they heard that Peter was in ˻Lydda˼, sent two men to him, urging, “Do not delay to come to us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So Peter got up and accompanied them. When he arrived, they brought him up to the upstairs room, and all the widows came to him, weeping and showing him tunics and other clothing that Dorcas used to make while she was with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Peter sent them all outside, and, falling to his knees, he prayed. And turning toward the body, he said, “Tabitha, get up!” And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he gave her his hand and raised her up. And he called the saints and the widows and presented her alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And it happened that he stayed many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
