Or why are you staring at us, as if by our own power or godliness we have made him walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and denied in the presence of Pilate, after he had decided to release him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and demanded that a man—a murderer—be granted to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you killed the originator of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And on the basis of faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know, and the faith that is through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your rulers did also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things which God foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he has fulfilled in this way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore repent and turn back, so that your sins may be blotted out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and he may send the Christ appointed for you—Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whom heaven must receive until the times of the restoration of all things, about which God spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You will listen to him in everything that he says to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it will be that every soul who—if he does not listen to that prophet—will be destroyed utterly from the people.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And indeed, all the prophets from Samuel and all those who followed him have spoken about and proclaimed these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God ordained with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>God, after he had raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning each of you back from your wickedness!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
