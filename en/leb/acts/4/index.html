For that a remarkable sign has taken place through them is evident to all those who live in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But in order that it may not spread much further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more in this name ˻to anyone at all˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called them backand commanded them not to speak or to teach at all in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than God, you decide!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For we are not able to refrain from speaking about the things that we have seen and heard.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So after threatening them further, they released them, finding no way to punish them on account of the people, because they were all praising God for what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they were released, they went to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they heard it, they lifted their voices with one mind to God and said, “Master, you are the one who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the one who said by the Holy Spirit through the mouth of our father David, your servant,‘Why do the nations rage,and the peoples conspire in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth stood opposed,and the rulers assembled together at the same place,against the Lord and against his Christ.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For in truth both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, assembled together in this city against your holy servant Jesus whom you anointed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do all that your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, concern yourself with their threats and grant your slaves to speak your message with all boldness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>as you extend your hand to heal and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the group of those who believed were one heart and soul, and no one said anything of what belonged to him was his own, but all things were theirs in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For there was not even anyone needy among them, because all those who were owners of plots of land or houses were selling themand bringing the proceeds of the things that were sold</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and placing them at the feet of the apostles. And it was being distributed to each as anyone had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So Joseph, who was called Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated “son of encouragement”), a Levite of Cyprus by nationality,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and placed it at the feet of the apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
