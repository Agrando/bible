And attacking Jason’s house, they were looking for them to bring them out to the popular assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers before the city officials, shouting, “These people who have stirred up trouble throughout the world have come here also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>whom Jason has entertained as guests! And these peopleare all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king, Jesus!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they threw the crowd into confusion, and the city officials who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And after taking money as security from Jason and the rest, they released them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now the brothers sent away both Paul and Silas at once, during the night, to Berea. ˻They˼ went into the synagogue of the Jews when they arrived.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now these were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica. ˻They˼ accepted the message with all eagerness, examining the scriptures every day to see if these things were so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore many of them believed, and not a few of the prominent Greek women and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the message of God had been proclaimed by Paul in Berea also, they came there too, inciting and stirring up the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So then the brothers sent Paul away at once to go to the sea, and both Silas and Timothy remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving an order for Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as soon as possible, they went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he observed the city was full of idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So he was discussing in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And even some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him, and some were saying, “What does this babbler want to say?” But others said, “He appears to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,” because he was proclaiming the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took hold of him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we learn what is this new teaching being proclaimed by you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are bringing some astonishing things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what ˻these things mean˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who stayed there used to spend their time in nothing else than telling something or listening to something new.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So Paul stood there in the middle of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see you are very religious ˻in every respect˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For as I was passing through and observeing carefully your objects of worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed, ‘To an unknown God.’ Therefore what you worship without knowing it, this I proclaim to you—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the God who made the world and all the things in it. This one, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by human hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>nor is he served by human hands as if he needed anything, because he himself gives to everyone life and breath and everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he made from one man every nation of humanity to live on all the face of the earth, determining their fixed times and the fixed boundaries of their habitation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to search for God, if perhaps indeed they might feel around for him and find him. And indeed he is not far away from each one of us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for in him we live and move and exist, as even some of ˻your own˼ poets have said: ‘For we also are ˻his˼ offspring.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore, because we are offspring of God, we ought not to think the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by human skill and thought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore although God has overlooked the times of ignorance, he now commands all people everywhere to repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because he has set a day on which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man who he has appointed, having provided proof to everyone by raising him from the dead.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some scoffed, but others said, “We will hear you about this again also.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Paul went out from the midst of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But some people joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman ˻named˼ Damaris and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
