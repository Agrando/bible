Therefore I beg you to listen to me with patience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>“Now all the Jews know my manner of life from my youth, that had taken place from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>having known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that in accordance with the strictest party of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now I stand here on trial on the basis of hope in the promise made by God to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to which our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve him night and day. Concerning this hope I am being accused by the Jews, O king!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why is it thought incredible by you people that God raises the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Indeed, I myself thought it was necessary to do many things opposed to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>which I also did in Jerusalem, and not only did I lock up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests, but also when they were being executed, I cast my vote against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And throughout all the synagogues I punished them often and tried to force them to blaspheme, and because I was enraged at them beyond measure, I was pursuing them even as far as to foreign cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In ˻this activity˼ I was traveling to Damascus with the authority and full power of the chief priests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the middle of the day along the road, O king, I saw a light from heaven, more than the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who were traveling with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Aramaic language, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But get up and stand on your feet, because for this reason I have appeared to you, to appoint you a servant and witness both to the things in which you saw me and to the things in which I will appear to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>rescuing you from the people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>“Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but to those in Damascus first, and in Jerusalem and all the region of Judea and to the Gentiles, I proclaimed that they should repent and turn to God, doing deeds worthy of repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>On account of these things the Jews seized me while I was in the temple courtsand were attempting to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore I have experienced help from God until this day, and I stand here testifying to both small and great, saying nothing except what both the prophets and Moses have said were going to happen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the Christ was to suffer and that as the first of the resurrection from the dead, he was going to proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, “You are out of your mind, Paul! Your great learning ˻is driving˼ you ˻insane˼!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Paul said, “I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but am speaking words of truth and rationality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the king knows about these things, to whom also I am speaking freely, for I am not convinced that any of these things in any way has escaped his notice, because this ˻was˼ not ˻done˼ in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Agrippa said to Paul, “In a short time are you persuading me to become a Christian?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paul replied, “I pray to God, whether in a short time or in a long time, not only you but also all those who are listening to me today may become such people as I also am, except for these bonds!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Both the king and the governor got up, and Bernice and those who were sitting with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And as they were going out, they were talking to one another, saying, “This man is not doing anything deserving death or imprisonment.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
