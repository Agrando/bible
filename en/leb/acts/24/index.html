For this reason also he sent for him as often as possible and talked with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when two years had passed, Felix received as successor Porcius Festus. And because he wanted to do a favor for the Jews, Felix left Paul behind ˻as a prisoner˼.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
