For nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But the voice replied from heaven for the second time, ‘The things which God has made clean, you must not consider unclean!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this happened three times, and everything was pulled up into heaven again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, at once three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea approached the house in which we were staying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the Spirit told me to accompany them, not hesitating at all. So these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the man’s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is also called Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who will speak words to you by which you will be saved, you and all your household.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I was beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as also on us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore if God gave them the same gift as also to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to hinder God?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they heard these things, they became silent and praised God, saying, “Then God has granted the repentance leading to life to the Gentiles also!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, proclaiming the message to no one except Jews alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they came to Antioch, began to speak to the Hellenists also, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>˻And the report came to the attention˼ of the church that was in Jerusalem about them, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who, when he arrived and saw the grace of God, rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with ˻devoted hearts˼,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a large number were added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he departed for Tarsus to look for Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it happened to them also that they met together for a whole year with the church and taught a large number of people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of them ˻named˼ Agabus stood up and indicated by the Spirit that a great famine was about to come over the whole inhabited earth (which took place in the time of Claudius).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So from the disciples, ˻according to their ability to give˼, each one of them determined to send financial aid for support to the brothers who lived in Judea,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>which they also did, sending the aid to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
