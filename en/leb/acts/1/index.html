This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven like this will come back in the same way you saw him departing into heaven!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain that is called Olive Grove which is near Jerusalem, ˻a Sabbath day’s journey away˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had entered, they went up to the upstairs room where they were staying—Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas son of James.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>All these were busily engaged with one mind in prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers (and it was a crowd of persons of about one hundred twenty at the same place) and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“Men and brothers, it was necessary that the scripture be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit proclaimed beforehand through the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because he was counted among us and received a share in this ministry.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now this man acquired a field for the wages of his wickedness, and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his intestines spilled out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it became known to all who live in Jerusalem, so that that field was called in their own language “Akeldama,” that is, “Field of Blood.”)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>“For it is written in the book of Psalms,‘Let his residence become deserted,and let there be no one to live in it,’and,‘Let another person take his position.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore it is necessary for one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from the baptism of John until the day on which he was taken up from us—one of these men must become a witness of his resurrection together with us.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they proposed two men, Joseph called Barsabbas (who was called Justus) and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed and said, “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show clearly which one of these two you have chosen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to depart to his own place.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was added to serve with the eleven apostles.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
