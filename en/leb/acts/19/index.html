And they counted up their value and found it was˻fifty thousand silver coins˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In this way the word of the Lord was growing in power and was prevailing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now when these things were completed, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, “After I have been there, it is necessary for me to see Rome also.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So after sending two of those who were assisting him, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, he himself stayed some time in Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there happened at that time no little disturbance concerning the Way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For someone ˻named˼ Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver replicas of the temple of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>˻These˼ he gathered together, and the workers occupied with such things, and said, “Men, you know that from this business ˻we get our prosperity˼,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this man Paul has persuaded and turned away a large crowd by saying that the gods made by hands are not gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So not only is there a danger this line of business of ours will come into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as nothing—and she is about to be brought down even from her grandeur, she whom the whole of Asia and the entire world worship!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when they heard this and became full of rage, they began to shout, saying, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the city was filled with the tumult, and with one purpose they rushed into the theater, seizing Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were traveling companions of Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when Paul wanted to enter into the popular assembly, the disciples would not let him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And even some of the Asiarchs who were his friends sent word to him and were urging him not to risk himself by going into the theater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So some were shouting one thingand some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know ˻why˼ they had assembled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And some of the crowd advised Alexander, when the Jews put him forward. But Alexander, motioning with his hand, was wanting to defend himself to the popular assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they were shouting with one voice from all of them for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the city secretary had quieted the crowd, he said, “Ephesian men, for who is there among men who does not know the Ephesian city is honorary temple keeper of the great Artemis and of her image fallen from heaven?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore because these things are undeniable, it is necessary that you be quiet and do nothing rash!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For you have brought these men herewho are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>If then Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against anyone, the court days are observed and there are proconsuls—let them bring charges against one another!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if you desire anything further, it will be settled in the lawful assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For indeed we are in danger of being accused of rioting concerning today, since there is no cause in relation to which we will be able to give an account concerning this disorderly gathering!” And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
