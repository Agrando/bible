I am guiltless! From now on I will go to the Gentiles!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And leaving there, he entered into the house of someone ˻named˼ Titius Justus, a worshiper of God whose house was next door to the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his whole household. And many of the Corinthians, when they heard about it, believed and were baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not keep silent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>because I am with you and no one will attack you to harm you, because many people are mine in this city.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one purpose against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it was some crime or wicked villainy, O Jews, ˻I would have been justified in accepting˼ your complaint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if it is questions concerning a word and names and ˻your own law˼, see to it yourselves! I do not wish to be a judge of these things.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them away from the judgment seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and began beating him in front of the judgment seat. And none of these things was a concern to Gallio.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Paul, after remaining many days longer, said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head at Cenchrea, because he had taken a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they arrived at Ephesus, and those he left behind there, but he himself entered into the synagogue and discussed with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did not give his consent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but saying farewell and telling them, “I will return to you again if God wills,” he set sail from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he arrived at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after spending some time there, he departed, traveling through one place after another in the Galatian region and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now a certain Jew ˻named˼ Apollos, ˻a native˼ Alexandrian, arrived in Ephesus—an eloquent man who was well-versed in the scriptures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being enthusiastic in spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged himand wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, ˻he˼ assisted greatly those who had believed through grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he was vigorously refuting the Jews in public, demonstrating through the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
