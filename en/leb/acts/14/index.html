We also are men with the same nature as you, proclaiming the good news that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things that are in them—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who in generations that are past permitted all the nations to go their own ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And yet he did not leave himself without witness by doing good, giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and your hearts with gladness.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And although they said these things, only with difficulty did they dissuade the crowds from offering sacrifice to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium, and when they had won over the crowds and stoned Paul, they dragged him outside the city, thinking he was dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But after the disciples surrounded him, he got up and went into the city. And on the next day he departed with Barnabas for Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And after they had proclaimed the good news in that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith and saying, “Through many persecutions it is necessary for us to enter into the kingdom of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, after praying with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And after they proclaimed the message in Perga, they went down to Attalia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and from there they sailed away to Antioch where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they arrived and called the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they stayed no little time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
