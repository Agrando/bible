If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect individual, able to hold in check his whole body also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if we put bits in the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we also guide their whole bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold also ships: although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot wishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So also the tongue is a small member of the body and boasts great things. Behold how small a fire sets ablaze how great a forest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the tongue is a fire! The world of unrighteousness, the tongue, is set among our members, defiling the whole body and setting on fire ˻the course of human existence˼, being set on fire by hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For every species of animals and birds, of reptiles and sea creatures, is being tamed and has been tamed by the human species,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but no human being is able to tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>A spring does not pour forth from the same opening fresh and bitter water, does it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A fig tree is not able, my brothers, to produce olives, or a grapevine figs. Neither can a saltwater spring produce fresh water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good behavior his works, with the humility of wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, obedient, full of mercy and good fruits, nonjudgmental, without hypocrisy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace among those who make peace.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
