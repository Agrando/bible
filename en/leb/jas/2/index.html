Did not God choose the poor of the world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you have dishonored the poor! Are not the rich exploiting you and they themselves dragging you into the courts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do they themselves not blaspheme the good name ˻of the one to whom you belong˼?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>However, if you carry out the royal law according to the scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and thus are convicted by the law as transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles in one point only has become guilty of all of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the one who said “Do not commit adultery” also said “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but you do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Thus speak and thus act as those who are going to be judged by the law of liberty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For judgment is merciless to the one who has not practiced mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What is the benefit, my brothers, if someone says that he has faith but does not have works? That faith is not able to save him, is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If a brother or a sister is poorly clothed and lacking food for the day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and one of you should say to them, “Go in peace, keep warm and ˻eat well˼,” but does not give them what is necessary for the body, what is the benefit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus also faith, if it does not have works, is dead by itself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe, and shudder!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But do you want to know, O foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You see that faith was working together with his works, and by the works the faith was perfected.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness,” and he was called God’s friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And likewise was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by a different route?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
