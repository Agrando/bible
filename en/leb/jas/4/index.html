Is it not from this, from your pleasures that wage war among your members?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>You desire and do not have; you murder and are filled with envy, and are not able to obtain; you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, in order that you may spend it on your pleasures.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or do you think that in vain the scripture says, “The spirit which he caused to dwell in us desires jealously”?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says,“God opposes the proud,but gives grace to the humble.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore subject yourselves to God. But resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to gloominess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Do not speak evil of one another, brothers. The one who speaks evil of a brother or judges his brother speaks evil of the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there, and carry on business and make a profit,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>you who do not know ˻what will happen tomorrow˼, ˻what your life will be like˼. For you are a smoky vapor that appears for a short time and then disappears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Instead you should say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, to the one who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
