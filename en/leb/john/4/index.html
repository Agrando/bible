It was about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me water to drink.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(For his disciples had gone away into the town so that they could buy food.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So the Samaritan woman said to him, “How do you, being a Jew, ask from me water to drink, since I am a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had known the gift of God and who it is who says to you, ‘Give me water to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket and the well is deep! From where then do you get this living water?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>You are not greater than our father Jacob, are you, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his livestock?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity, but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or come here to draw water!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He said to her, “Go, call your husband and come here.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The woman answered and said to him, “I do not have a husband.” Jesus said to her, “You have said rightly, ‘I do not have a husband,’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you have now is not your husband; this you have said truthfully!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But an hour is coming—and now is here—when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for indeed the Father seeks such peopleto be his worshipers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God is spirit, and the ones who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ); “whenever that one comes, he will proclaim all things to us.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And at this point his disciples came, and they were astonished that he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, “What do you seek?” or “Why are you speaking with her?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>“Come, see a man who told me everything I have ever done! Perhaps this one is the Christ?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>They went out from the town and were coming to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the meanwhile the disciples were asking him, saying, “Rabbi, eat something!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one brought him anything to eat, did they?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to them, “My food is that I do the will of the one who sent me and complete his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months and the harvest comes’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, that they are white for harvest already.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The one who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, in order that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For in this instance the saying is true, ‘It is one who sows and another who reaps.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I sent you to reap what you did not work for; others have worked, and you have entered into their work.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now from that town many of the Samaritans believed in him because of the word of the woman who testified, “He told me everything that I have done.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them. And he stayed there two days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many more believed because of his word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they were saying to the woman, “No longer because of ˻what you said˼ do we believe, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And after the two days he departed from there into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own homeland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast (for they themselves had also come to the feast).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Now he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was at Capernaum a certain royal official whose son was sick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>This man, when he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, went to him and asked that he come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>The royal official said to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus said to him, “Go, your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Now as he was going down, his slaves met him, saying that his child was alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>So he inquired from them the hour at which he had gotten better. Then they said to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So the father knew that it was at that same hour at which Jesus said to him, “Your son will live,” and he himself believed, and his whole household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now this is again a second sign Jesus performed when he came from Judea into Galilee.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
