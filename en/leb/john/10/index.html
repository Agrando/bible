If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and will go out and will find pasture.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The thief ˻comes only˼ so that he can steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The hired hand, who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf approaching and abandons the sheep and runs away—and the wolf seizes them and scatters them—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>because he is a hired hand and ˻he is not concerned˼ about the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>“I am the good shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I lay down my life for the sheep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I have other sheep which are not from this fold. I must bring these also, and they will hear my voice, and they will become one flock—one shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I may take possession of it again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down ˻voluntarily˼. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take possession of it again. This commandment I received from my Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Again there was a division among the Jews because of these words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is out of his mind! Why do you listen to him?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Others were saying, “These are not the words of one who is possessed by a demon! A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind, is it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the feast of the Dedication took place in Jerusalem. It was winter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Jesus was walking in the temple in the Portico of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So the Jews surrounded him and began to say to him, “˻How long will you keep us in suspense˼? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus answered them, “I told you and you do not believe! The deeds that I do in the name of my Father, these testify about me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And I give them eternal life, and they will never perish ˻forever˼, and no one will seize them out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can seize them from the Father’s hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The Father and I are one.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The Jews picked up stones again so that they could stone him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The Jews answered him, “We are not going to stone you concerning a good deed, but concerning blasphemy, and because you, although you are a man, make yourself to be God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods” ’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>If he called them ‘gods’ to whom the word of God came—and the scripture cannot be broken—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>do you say about he whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If I do not do the deeds of my Father, do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if I am doing them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So they were seeking again to seize him, and he departed out of their hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he went away again on the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And many came to him and began to say, “John performed no sign, but everything John said about this man was true!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And many believed in him there.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
