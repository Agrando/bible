So he went and washed and came back seeing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the neighbors and those who saw him previously (because he was a beggar) began to say, “Is this man not the one who used to sit and beg?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Others were saying, “It is this man”; others were saying, “No, but he is like him.” That one was saying, “I am he!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they began to say to him, “Then how were your eyes opened?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He replied, “The man who is called Jesus made clay and smeared it on my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash!’ So I went, and I washed, and I received sight.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they said to him, “Where is that man?” He said, “I do not know.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They brought him—the one formerly blind—to the Pharisees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>(Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes was the Sabbath.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the Pharisees also were asking him again how he received sight. And he said to them, “He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man is not from God, because he does not observe the Sabbath!” But others were saying, “How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?” And there was a division among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So they said to the blind man again, “What do you say about him, because he opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received sight, until they summoned the parents of the one who received sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they asked them, saying, “Is this man your son, whom you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So his parents answered and said, “We know that this man is our son, and that he was born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But how he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him! ˻He is a mature adult˼; he will speak for himself!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>(His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already decided that if anyone should confess him to be Christ, he would be expelled from the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Because of this his parents said, “˻He is a mature adult˼; ask him.”)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So they summoned the man who had been blind for the second time and said to him, “Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then that man replied, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I know—that although I was blind, now I see!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He replied to them, “I told you already and you did not listen! Why do you want to hear it again? You do not want to become his disciples also, do you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they reviled him and said, “You are his disciple! But we are disciples of Moses!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this man is from.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The man answered and said to them, “For the remarkable thing is this, that you do not know where he is from, and he opened my eyes!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if someone is devout and does his will, he listens to this one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>From ˻time immemorial˼ it has not been heard that someone opened the eyes of one born blind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>If this man were not from God, he would not be able to do anything!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>They answered and said to him, “You were born completely in sin, and are you attempting to teach us?” And they threw him out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, and finding him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He answered and said, “And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and he is the one who is speaking with you.” 〚</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said, “I believe, Lord!” and he worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Jesus said,〛 “For judgment I have come into this world, so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and said to him, “We are not also blind, are we?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would not have sin. But now you say, ‘We see,’ your sin remains.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
