And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>“˻Why˼ was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>(Now he said this not because ˻he was concerned˼ about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the money box, he used to steal what was put into it.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Jesus said, “Leave her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of my preparation for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For you have the poor with you always, but you do not always have me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now the large crowd of Jews found out that he was there, and they came, not only because of Jesus, but so that they could see Lazarus also, whom he raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the chief priests decided that they would kill Lazarus also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because on account of him many of the Jews were going and believing in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>took the branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, and began crying out,“Hosanna!Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord,even the king of Israel!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion!Behold, your king is coming,seated on the foal of a donkey!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and they did these things to him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So the crowd who was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because of this also the crowd went to meet him, for they had heard that he had performed this sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up in order to worship at the feast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and began asking him saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Philip went and told Andrew. Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus answered them, saying, “The hour has come that the Son of Man will be glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Truly, truly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it bears much fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The one who loves his life loses it, and the one who hates his life in this world preserves it for eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If anyone serves me, he must follow me, and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>“Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, deliver me from this hour’? But for this reason I have come to this hour!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Father, glorify your name!” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have both glorified it, and I will glorify it again.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the crowd that stood there and heard it said ˻it had thundered˼. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Jesus answered and said, “This voice has not happened for my sake, but for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now is the judgment of this world! Now the ruler of this world will be thrown out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>(Now he said this to indicate by what sort of death he was going to die.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then the crowd replied to him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains ˻forever˼! And how do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So Jesus said to them, “Yet a little time the light is with you! Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness does not overtake you! And the one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>While you have the light, believe in the light, in order that you may become sons of light.” Jesus said these things, and then he went away and was hidden from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But as many signs as he had performed before them, they did not believe in him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>in order that the word of the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,“Lord, who has believed our message?And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For this reason they were not able to believe, because again Isaiah said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>“He has blinded their eyesand hardened their hearts,lest they see with their eyesand understand with their heartsand turn, and I heal them.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory, and he spoke about him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Yet despite that, even many of the rulers believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, so that they would not be expelled from the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For they loved the praise of men more than praise from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But Jesus cried out and said, “The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>I have come as a light into the world, in order that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if anyone hears my words and does not observe them, I will not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has one who judges him; the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father himself who sent me ˻has commanded me˼ what I should say and what I should speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. So the things that I say, just as the Father said to me, thus I say.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
