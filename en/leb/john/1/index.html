Are you Elijah?” And he said, “I am not!” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said,“I am ‘the voice of one crying out in the wilderness,“Make straight the way of the Lord,” ’just as Isaiah the prophet said.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>(And they had been sent from the Pharisees.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they asked him and said to him, “Why then are you baptizing, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>John answered them, saying, “I baptize with water. In your midst stands one whom you do not know—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>the one who comes after me, of whom I am not worthy ˻to untie˼ the strap of his sandal!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>These things took place in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>On the next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, “Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This one is the one about whom I said, ‘After me is coming a man who is ahead of me, because he existed before me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I did not know him, but in order that he could be revealed to Israel, because of this I came baptizing with water.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And John testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and remaining upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And I did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water, that one said to me, ‘The one upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him—this one is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I have seen and testify that this one is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>On the next day again John was standing there, and two of his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and looking at Jesus as he was walking by, he said, “Look! The Lamb of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Jesus, turning around and seeing them following him, said to them, “What do you seek?” And they said to him, “Rabbi” (which means when translated “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>He said to them, “Come and you will see!” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day (it was about the tenth hour).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard John and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>This one first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated “Christ”).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>He brought him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, “You are Simon the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is interpreted “Peter”).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>On the next day he wanted to depart for Galilee, and he found Philip. And Jesus said to him, “Follow me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>(Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets wrote about—Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Nathanael said to him, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, “Look! ˻A true Israelite˼ in whom is no deceit!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Nathanael said to him, “From where do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the king of Israel!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Jesus answered and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he said to him, “Truly, truly I say to all of you, you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
