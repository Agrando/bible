So the men reclined, approximately five thousand in number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then Jesus took the bread, and after he had given thanks, he distributed it to those who were reclining—likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they were satisified, he said to his disciples, “Gather the remaining fragments so that nothing is lost.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they gathered them, and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the people saw the sign that he performed, they began to say, “This one is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then Jesus, because he knew that they were about to come and seize him in order to make him king, withdrew again up the mountain by himself alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And getting into a boat, they began to go to the other side of the sea, to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sea began to be stirred up because a strong wind was blowing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said to them, “It is I! Do not be afraid!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they were wanting to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land to which they were going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the next day, the crowd that was on the other side of the sea saw that other boats were not there (except one), and that Jesus had not entered with his disciples into the boat, but his disciples had departed alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and came to Capernaum seeking Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus replied to them and said, “Truly, truly I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were satisfied!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Do not work for the food that perishes, but the food that remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has set his seal on this one.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So they said to him, “What shall we do that we can accomplish the works of God?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God: that you believe in the one whom that one sent.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they said to him, “Then what sign will you perform, so that we can see it and believe you? What will you do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, Moses did not give you bread from heaven, but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For the bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So they said to him, “Sir, always give us this bread!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one who comes to me will never be hungry, and the one who believes in me will never be thirsty again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I said to you that you have seen me and do not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will never throw out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>because I have come down from heaven not that I should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now this is the will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me, I would not lose any of them, but raise them up on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now the Jews began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and they were saying, “Is this one not Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Jesus answered and said to them, “Do not grumble ˻among yourselves˼!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>No one is able to come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him up on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>It is written in the prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who hears from the Father and learns comes to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>(Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God—this one has seen the Father.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly, truly I say to you, the one who believes has eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>I am the bread of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness and they died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>This is the bread that comes down from heaven so that someone may eat from it and not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread, he will live ˻forever˼. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>So the Jews began to quarrel ˻among themselves˼, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Then Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>The one who eats my flesh and drinks my blood resides in me and I in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so also the one who eats me—that one will live because of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This is the bread that came down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and died. The one who eats this bread will live ˻forever˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>He said these thingswhile teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Thus many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, “This saying is hard! Who can understand it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But Jesus, because he knew within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, “Does this cause you to be offended?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Then what if you see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>The Spirit is the one who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And he said, “Because of this I said to you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>For this reason many of his disciples ˻drew back˼ and were not walking with him any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>So Jesus said to the twelve, “You do not want to go away also, do you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>Jesus replied to them, “Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is the devil?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>(Now he was speaking about Judas son of Simon Iscariot, because this one—one of the twelve—was going to betray him.)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
