He is not able to enter into his mother’s womb for the second time and be born, can he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Jesus answered, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone is born of water and spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Do not be astonished that I said to you, ‘It is necessary for you to be born from above.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The wind blows wherever it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Nicodemus answered and said to him, “How can these things be?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and you do not understand these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly, truly I say to you, we speak what we know, and we testify about what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If I tell you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And no one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven—the Son of Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, thus it is necessary that the Son of Man be lifted up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For in this way God loved the world, so that he gave his one and only Son, in order that everyone who believes in him will not perish, but will have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God did not send his Son into the world in order that he should judge the world, but in order that the world should be saved through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The one who believes in him is not judged, but the one who does not believe has already been judged, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For everyone who practices evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds be exposed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, in order that his deeds may be revealed, that they are done in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>After these things Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and they were coming and were being baptized.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>(For John had not yet been thrown into prison.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So a dispute occurred on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew concerning purification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, about whom you testified—look, this one is baptizing, and all are coming to him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>John answered and said, “A man can receive not one thing unless it is granted to him from heaven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You yourselves testify about me that I said, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am sent before that one.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices ˻greatly˼ because of the bridegroom’s voice. So this joy of mine is complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It is necessary for that one to increase, but for me to decrease.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The one who comes from above is over all. The one who is from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth; the one who comes from heaven is over all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What he has seen and heard, this he testifies, and no one accepts his testimony.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The one who accepts his testimony has attested that God is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the one whom God sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life—but the wrath of God remains on him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
