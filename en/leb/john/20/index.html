Then, while she was weeping, she bent over to look into the tomb,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and she saw two angels in white, seated one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When she had said these things, she turned ˻around˼ and saw Jesus standing there, and she did not know that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” She thought that it was the gardener, and said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned around and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni” (which means “Teacher”).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to her, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene came and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and he had said these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now when it was evening on that day—the first day of the week—and the doors had been shut where the disciples were because of fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said to them, “Peace to you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he had said this, he showed his hands and his side to them. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Jesus said to them again, “Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, I also send you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them. If you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who was called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after eight days his disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Although the doors had been shut, Jesus came and stood in their midst and said, “Peace to you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to Thomas, “Place your finger here and see my hands, and place your hand and put it into my side. And do not be unbelieving, but believing!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to him, “Because you have seen me, have you believed? Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Jesus also performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples which are not recorded in this book,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>but these things are recorded in order that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
