He said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Jesus answered and said to him, “What I am doing you do not understand now, but you will understand after these things.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet ˻forever˼!” Jesus replied to him, “Unless I wash you, you do not have a share with me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Jesus said to him, “The one who has bathed ˻only needs˼ to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you are clean, but not all of you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>(For he knew the one who would betray him; because of this he said, “Not all of you are clean.”)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So when he had washed their feet and taken his outer clothing and reclined at table again, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and you speak correctly, for I am.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If then I—your Lord and Teacher—wash your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For I have given you an example, that just as I have done for you, you also do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Truly, truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor a messenger greater than the one who sent him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If you understand these things, you are blessed if you do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“I am not speaking about all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, ‘The one who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>From now on I am telling you before it happens, in order that when it happens you may believe that I am he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly I say to you, the one who receives anyone I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When he had said these things, Jesus was troubled in spirit and testified and said, “Truly, truly I say to you that one of you will betray me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The disciples began looking at one another, uncertain about whom he was speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One of his disciples—the one whom Jesus loved—was reclining ˻close beside˼ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Simon Peter gestured for this one to inquire who it was about whom he was speaking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then he leaned back accordingly against Jesus’ chest and said to him, “Lord, who is it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Jesus replied, “It is he to whom I dip the piece of bread and give it to him.” Then after dipping the piece of bread, he took it and gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after the piece of bread, then Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said to him, “What you are doing, do quickly!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>(Now no one of those reclining at table knew for what reason he said this to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For some were thinking because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, “Purchase ˻what we need˼ for the feast,” or that he should give something to the poor.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So after he had taken the piece of bread, he went out immediately. And it was night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then, when he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and will glorify him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Children, yet a little time I am with you. You will seek me and just as I said to the Jews, “Where I am going you cannot come,” now I say also to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>“A new commandment I give to you: that you love one another—just as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>By this everyone will know that you are my disciples—if you have love for one another.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus replied to him, “Where I am going you cannot follow me now, but you will follow later.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Peter said to him, “Lord, why am I not able to follow you now? I will lay down my life for you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Jesus replied, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly I say to you, the rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
