For he did not want to go about in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Now the feast of the Jews—the feast of Tabernacles—was near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So his brothers said to him, “Depart from here and go to Judea, so that your disciples also can see your works that you are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For no one does anything in secret and yet he himself desires to be ˻publicly recognized˼. If you are doing these things, reveal yourself to the world!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>(For not even his brothers believed in him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So Jesus said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it, that its deeds are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You go up to the feast. I am not going up to this feast, because my time is not yet completed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when he had said these things, he remained in Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not openly, but (as it were) in secret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So the Jews were looking for him at the feast, and were saying, “Where is he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And there was a lot of grumbling concerning him among the crowds; some were saying, “He is a good man,” but others were saying, “No, but he deceives the crowd.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>However, no one was speaking openly about him for fear of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>˻Now when the feast was already half over˼, Jesus went to the temple courts and began to teach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Jews were astonished, saying, “How does this man ˻possess knowledge˼, because he has not been taught?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not mine, but is from the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If anyone wants to do his will, he will know about my teaching, whether it is from God or I am speaking from myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory. But the one who seeks the glory of the one who sent him—this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Has not Moses given you the law, and none of you carries out the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The crowd replied, “You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus answered and said to them, “I performed one work, and you are all astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because of this Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses would not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a whole man well on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do not judge according to outward appearance, but judge according to righteous judgment!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem began to say, “Is this not the one whom they are seeking to kill?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And behold, he is speaking openly and they are saying nothing to him! Can it be that the rulers truly know that this man is the Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yet we know where this man is from, but the Christ, whenever he comes—no one knows where he is from!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus cried out in the temple courts, teaching and saying, “You both know me and you know where I am from! And I have not come from myself, but the one who sent me is true, whom you do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I know him, because I am from him and he sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So they were seeking to seize him, and no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But from the crowd many believed in him and were saying, “Whenever the Christ comes, he will not perform more signs than this man has done, will he?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers in order ˻to take him into custody ˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus said, “Yet a little time I am with you, and I am going to the one who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You will seek me and will not find me, and where I am, you cannot come.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>So the Jews said to one another, “Where is this one going to go, that we will not find him? He is not going to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>What is this saying that he said, ‘You will seek me and will not find me, and where I am, you cannot come’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now on the last day of the feast—the great day—Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and let him drink,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>the one who believes in me. Just as the scripture said, ‘Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now he said this concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were about to receive. For the Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then, when they heard these words, some from the crowd began to say, “This man is truly the Prophet!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Others were saying, “This man is the Christ!” But others were saying, “No, for the Christ does not come from Galilee, does he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So there was a division in the crowd because of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So the officers came to the chief priests and Pharisees. And they said to them, “˻Why˼ did you not bring him?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The officers replied, “Never has a man spoken like this!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Then the Pharisees replied to them, “You have not also been deceived, have you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>˻None˼ of the rulers or of the Pharisees have believed in him, have they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But this crowd who does not know the law is accursed!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nicodemus, the one who came to him previously—who was one of them—said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>“Our law does not condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>They answered and said to him, “You are not also from Galilee, are you? Investigate and see that a prophet does not arise from Galilee!” 〚</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And each one went to his own house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
