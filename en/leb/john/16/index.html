For if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>concerning sin, because they do not believe in me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and concerning righteousness, because I am going away to the Father and you will see me no more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I still have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when he—the Spirit of truth—comes, he will guide you into all the truth. For he will not speak from himself, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will proclaim to you the things to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and will proclaim it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everything that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he takes from what is mine and will proclaim it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“A little while and you will see me no more, and again a little while and you will see me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he is saying to us, ‘A little while and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me,’ and ‘Because I am going away to the Father’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So they kept on saying, “What is this that he is saying, ‘A little while’? We do not understand what he is speaking about!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Jesus knew that they were wanting to ask him, and he said to them, “Are you deliberating with one another about this—that I said, ‘A little while, and you will not see me, and again a little while and you will see me’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Truly, truly I say to you, that you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will become sorrowful, but your sorrow will change to joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>A woman, when she gives birth, experiences pain because her hour has come. But when her child is born, she no longer remembers the affliction, on account of the joy that a human being has been born into the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So you also are experiencing sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take away your joy from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And on that day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“I have said these things to you in figurative sayings. An hour is coming when I will speak to you in figurative sayings no longer, but I will tell you plainly about the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on your behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I have gone out from the Father and have come into the world; again, I am leaving the world and am going to the Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>His disciples said, “Behold, now you are speaking ˻plainly˼ and are telling us no figurative saying!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now we know that you know everything and do not ˻need for˼ anyone to ask you questions. By this we believe that you have come from God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Jesus replied to them, “Now do you believe?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Behold, an hour is coming—and has come—that you will be scattered each one to his own home, and you will leave me alone. And I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have said these things to you so that in me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but have courage! I have conquered the world.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
