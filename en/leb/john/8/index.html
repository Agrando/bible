And all the people were coming to him, and he sat down and began to teach them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery. And standing her in their midst,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>they said to him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>(Now they were saying this to test him, so that they would have an occasion to bring charges against him.) But Jesus, bending down, began to write with his finger on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when they persisted in asking him, he straightened up and said to them, “The one of you without sin, let him throw the first stone at her!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And bending down again, he wrote on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when they heard it, they began to depart, one by one, beginning with the older ones, and he was left alone—and the woman who was in their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So straightening up, Jesus said to her, “Woman, where are they? Does no one condemn you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And she said, “No one, Lord.” So Jesus said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, and from now on, sin no more.”〛</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying, “I am the light of the world! The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the Pharisees said to him, “You testify concerning yourself! Your testimony is not true.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I testify concerning myself, my testimony is true, because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I have come from or where I am going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You judge according to externals; I do not judge anyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But even if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I am the one who testifies concerning myself, and the Father who sent me testifies concerning me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So they were saying to him, “Where is your father?” Jesus replied, “You know neither me nor my Father! If you had known me, you would have known my Father also.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He spoke these words by the treasury while teaching in the temple courts, and no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he said to them again, “I am going away, and you will seek me and will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the Jews began to say, “Perhaps he will kill himself, because he is saying, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, “You are from below; I am from above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus I said to you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So they began to say to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “˻What˼ I have been saying to you from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but the one who sent me is true, and the things which I heard from him, these things I say to the world.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>(They did not know that he was speaking to them about the Father.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus said to them, “When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will recognize that I am he, and I do nothing from myself, but just as the Father taught me, I say these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the one who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do the things that are pleasing to him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>While he was saying these things, many believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him, “If you continue in my word you are truly my disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They replied to him, “We are descendants of Abraham and have not been enslaved to anyone at any time. How do you say, ‘You will become free’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus replied to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the slave does not remain in the household ˻forever˼; the son remains ˻forever˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So if the son sets you free, you will be truly free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I know that you are descendants of Abraham. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word makes no progress among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I speak the things that I have seen with the Father; so also you do the things that you have heard from the Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They answered and said to him, “Abraham is our father!” Jesus said to them, “If you are children of Abraham, do the deeds of Abraham!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But now you are seeking to kill me, a man who spoke to you the truth which I heard from God. This Abraham did not do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You are doing the deeds of your father!”Then they said to him, “We were not born from sexual immorality! We have one father, God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, “If God were your father, you would love me, for I have come forth from God and have come. For I have not come from myself, but that one sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>˻Why˼ do you not understand my way of speaking? Because you are not able to listen to my message.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father! That one was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand firm in the truth, because truth is not in him. Whenever he speaks the lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father ˻of lies˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But because I am telling the truth, you do not believe me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Who among you convicts me concerning sin? If I am telling the truth, ˻why˼ do you not believe me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The one who is from God listens to the words of God. Because of this you do not listen—because you are not of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>The Jews answered and said to him, “Do we not correctly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Jesus replied, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I do not seek my own glory. There is one who seeks and judges!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never experience death ˻forever˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then the Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham and the prophets died, and you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death ˻forever˼.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? And the prophets died! Who do you make yourself to be?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. The one who glorifies me is my Father, about whom you say, ‘He is our God.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, I would be a liar like you! But I know him and I keep his word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Abraham your father rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw it and was glad.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>So the Jews said to him, “˻You are˼ not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly I say to you, before Abraham was, I am!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Then they picked up stones in order to throw them at him. But Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple courts.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
