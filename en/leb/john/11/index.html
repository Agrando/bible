If anyone walks around in the daylight, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if anyone walks around in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He said these things, and after this he said to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I can awaken him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>(Now Jesus had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about ˻real sleep˼.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus has died,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I am glad ˻for your sake˼ that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Thomas (the one who is called Didymus) said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go also, so that we may die with him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So when he arrived, Jesus found he had already been four days in the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary in order to console them concerning their brother.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But even now I know that whatever you ask God, God will grant you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me, even if he dies, will live,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and everyone who lives and believes in me will never die ˻forever˼. Do you believe this?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>She said to him, “Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who comes into the world.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, saying, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So that one, when she heard it, got up quickly and went to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>(Now Jesus has not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha went to meet him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So the Jews who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw Mary—that she stood up quickly and went out—followed her, because they thought that she was going to the tomb in order to weep there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then Jesus, when he saw her weeping and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled within himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Jesus wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So the Jews were saying, “See how he loved him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But some of them said, “Was not this man who opened the eyes of the blind able to do something so that this man also would not have died?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Jesus, deeply moved within himself again, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the one who had died, said to him, “Lord, he is stinking already, because it has been four days.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Jesus said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes above and said, “Father, I give thanks to you that you hear me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And I know that you always hear me, but for the sake of the crowd standing around I said it, so that they may believe that you sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And when he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>The one who had died came out, his feet and his hands bound with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped with a facecloth. Jesus said to them, “Untie him and let him go.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then many of the Jews who had come with Mary and saw the things which he did believed in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them the things which Jesus had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>So the chief priests and the Pharisees called together the Sanhedrin and said, “What are we doing? For this man is performing many signs!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>If we allow him to go on in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas (who was high priest in that year), said to them, “You do not know anything at all!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Nor do you consider that it is profitable for you that one man should die for the people, and the whole nation not perish.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>(Now he did not say this from himself, but being high priest in that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and not for the nation only, but also that the children of God who are scattered would be gathered into one.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>So from that day they resolved that they should kill him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>So Jesus was no longer walking openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the surrounding country before the Passover, so that they could purify themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>So they were looking for Jesus, and were speaking with one another while standing in the temple courts, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>(Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, they should report it, in order that they could arrest him.)</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
