Because I do not love you? God knows I do!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But what I am doing, I will also do, in order that I may remove the opportunity of those who want an opportunity, that they may be found just as also we are in what they are boasting about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And no wonder, for Satan himself disguises himself as an angel of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore it is not a great thing if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will be according to their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Again I say, do not let anyone think I am foolish. But indeed, if you do, accept me even as foolish, in order that I also may boast a little.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>What I am saying in this project of boasting, I am not saying as the Lord would say, but as in foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since many are boasting according to human standards, I also will boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For because you are wise, you put up with foolish people gladly!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes advantage of you, if someone is presumptious toward you, if someone strikes you in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I say this to my shame, namely, that we have been weak.But in whatever anyone dares to boast—I am speaking in foolishness—I also dare to boast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Are they Hebrews? I am also! Are they Israelites? I am also! Are they descendants of Abraham? I am also!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Are they servants of Christ?—I am speaking as though I were beside myself—I am more so, with far greater labors, with far more imprisonments, with beatings to a much greater degree, in danger of death many times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Five times I received at the hands of the Jews forty lashes less one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I received a stoning. Three times I was shipwrecked. A day and a night I have spent in the deep water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I have been on journeys many times, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own people, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers because of false brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>with toil and hardship, often in sleepless nights, with hunger and thirst, often going hungry, in cold and poorly clothed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Apart from these external things, there is the pressure on me every day of the anxiety about all the churches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to sin, and I do not burn with indignation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If it is necessary to boast, I will boast about˻the things related to my weakness˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed ˻forever˼, knows that I am not lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to take me into custody,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and I was lowered through a window through the wall in a rope-basket, and I escaped his hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
