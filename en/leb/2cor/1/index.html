But I hope that you will understand ˻completely˼,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>just as you have also understood us in part, that we are your reason for boasting, just as you are also ours in the day of our Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And with this confidence, I was wanting to come to you previously, in order that you may have a second proof of my goodwill,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and through you to go to Macedonia, and to come to you again from Macedonia, and to be sent on my way by you to Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore, when I was wanting to do this, perhaps then was I making use of vacillation? Or was I deciding what I was deciding according to the flesh, in order that with me my “yes” may be “yes” and my “no” may be “no” at the same time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But God is faithful, so that our word to you is not “yes” and “no.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was proclaimed among you by us, by me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become “yes” and “no,” but has become “yes” in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For as many as are the promises of God, in him they are “yes”; therefore also through him is the “amen” to the glory of God through us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now the one who establishes us together with you in Christ and who anoints us is God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who also sealed us and gave the down payment of the Spirit in our hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I call upon God as witness against my life, that in order to spare you, I did not come again to Corinth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers for your joy, because by faith you stand firm.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
