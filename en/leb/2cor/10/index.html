If anyone is convinced he himself is Christ’s, he should consider this concerning himself again: that just as Christ himself is, so also are we.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For even if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us˻for building you up and not for tearing you down˼, I will not be put to shame,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>so that I do not want to appear as if I were terrifying you by my letters,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>because it is said, “His letters are severe and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech is of no account.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Let such a person consider this: that what we are in word by letters when we are absent, we will also be in ˻actions˼when we are present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For we do not dare to classify or to compare ourselves with some who commend themselves, but they themselves, when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, do not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But we will not boast ˻beyond limits˼, but according to the measure of the assignment that God has assigned to us as a measure to reach even as far as you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, because we have reached even as far as you with the gospel of Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>not boasting ˻beyond limits˼ in the labors of others, but having hope that as your faith is growing to be enlarged greatly by you according to our assignment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>so that we may proclaim the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you, and not boast in the things accomplished in the area assigned to someone else.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But “the one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
