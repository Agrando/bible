Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan, in order that it would torment me so that I would not exalt myself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would depart from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, because the power is perfected in weakness.” Therefore rather I will boast most gladly in my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may reside in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions and difficulties for the sake of Christ, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I have become a fool! You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for I am in no way inferior to the preeminent apostles, even if I am nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Indeed, the signs of an apostle have been done among you with all patient endurance, both signs and wonders and deeds of power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>˻For in what respect are you made worse off˼ more than the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you. For I am not seeking your possessions, but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But I will spend and be expended most gladly for your lives. If I love you much more, am I to be loved less?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But let it be. I have not been a burden to you, but because I was crafty, I took you by cunning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I have not taken advantage of you ˻through anyone whom I sent to you˼, have I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I urged Titus to go, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same footsteps?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have you been thinking all this time that we are defending ourselves to you? We are speaking in Christ before God, and all these things, dear friends, are for your edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I am afraid lest somehow when I arrive, I will not find you as I want, and I may be found by you as you do not want. I am afraid lest somehow there will be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, slander, gossip, pride, disorder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I am afraid lest when I come again my God will humiliate me ˻in your presence˼, and I will grieve over many of those who sinned previously and have not repented because of their impurity and sexual immorality and licentiousness that they have practiced.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
