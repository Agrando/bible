Considering reveling in the daytime a pleasure, they are stains and blemishes, carousing in their deceitful pleasures when they feast together with you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>having eyes full of desire for an adulteress and unceasing from sin, enticing unstable persons, and having hearts trained for greediness. Accursed children!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>By leaving the straight path, they have gone astray, because they followed the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>but received a rebuke for his own lawlessness: a speechless donkey, speaking with a human voice, restrained ˻the prophet’s madness˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These people are waterless springs and mists driven by a hurricane, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>˻For by speaking high-sounding but empty words˼, they entice with desires of the flesh and with licentiousness those who are scarcely escaping from those who live in error,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>promising them freedom although they themselves are slaves of depravity. For to whatever someone succumbs, by this he is enslaved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if, after they have escaped from the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and they are again entangled in these thingsand succumb to them, the last state has become worse for them than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The statement of the true proverb has happened to them, “A dog returns to its own vomit,” and “A sow, after washing herself, returns to wallowing in the mud.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
