Because of this the world does not know us: because it did not know him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever he is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself, just as that one is pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And you know that that one was revealed in order that he might take away sins, and in him there is no sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Everyone who resides in him does not sin. Everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Little children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the works of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin, because his seed resides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>By this the children of God and the children of the devil are evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, namely, the one who does not love his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning: that we should love one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>not as Cain, who was of the evil one and violently murdered his brother. And ˻for what reason˼ did he violently murder him? Because his deeds were evil and the deeds of his brother were righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And do not marvel, brothers, if the world hates you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>We know that we have passed over from death to life because we love the brothers. The one who does not love remains in death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that every murderer does not have eternal life residing in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>We have come to know love by this: that ˻he˼ laid down his life on behalf of us, and we ought to lay down our lives on behalf of the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But whoever has the world’s material possessions and observes his brother ˻in need˼ and shuts his heart against him, how does the love of God reside in him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And by this we know that we are of the truth and will convince our heart before him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that if our heart condemns us, that God is greater than our heart and knows all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Dear friends, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what is pleasing ˻in his sight˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And this is his commandment: that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as ˻he commanded us˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the one who keeps his commandments resides in him, and he in him. And by this we know that he resides in us: by the Spirit whom he has given to us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
