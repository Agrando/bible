And his commandments are not burdensome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>because everyone who is fathered by God conquers the world.And this is the victory which has conquered the world: our faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now who is the one who conquers the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ, not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there are three that testify,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are ˻in agreement˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If we receive the testimony of people, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that he has testified concerning his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>(The one who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. The one who does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning his Son.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The one who has the Son has the life; the one who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this is the confidence that we have before him: that if we ask anything according to his will, he hears us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone should see his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he should ask, and he will grant life to him, to those who sin not leading to death.
