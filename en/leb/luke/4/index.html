And he ate nothing during those days, and when they were completed, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So the devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order this stone that it become bread!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus replied to him, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the devil said to him, “I will give you all this domain and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I can give it to whomever I want.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So if you will worship before me, all this will be yours.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, “It is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he brought him to Jerusalem, and had him stand on the highest point of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for it is written,‘He will command his angels concerning you,to protect you,’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and‘on their hands they will lift you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, “It is said, ‘You are not to put to the test the Lord your God.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from him until a favorable time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news about him went out throughout all the surrounding region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he began to teach in their synagogues, and was praised by all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he came to Nazareth, where ˻he had been brought up˼, and according to ˻his custom˼ he entered into the synagogue on the day of the Sabbath and stood up to read.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him, and unrolling the scroll he found the place where it was written,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,because of which he has anointed meto proclaim good news to the poor.He has sent meto proclaim release to the captives,and recovery of sight to the blind,to send out in freedom those who are oppressed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were looking intently at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were all speaking well of him, and were astonished at the gracious words that were coming out of his mouth. And they were saying, “Is this man not the son of Joseph?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said to them, “Doubtless you will tell me this parable: ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ Whatever we have heard that took place in Capernaum, do here in your hometown also!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, “Truly I say to you that no prophet is acceptable in his own hometown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But in truth I say to you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the sky was shut for three years and six months while a great famine took place over all the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Elijah was sent to none of them, but only to Zarephath in the region of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, and none of them was made clean except Naaman the Syrian.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And all those in the synagogue were filled with anger when they heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they stood up and forced him out of the town and brought him up to the edge of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But he passed through their midst and went on his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came down to Capernaum, a town of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they were astounded at his teaching, because ˻he spoke˼ with authority.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>“Ha! ˻Leave us alone˼, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!” And after throwing him down in their midst, the demon came out of him without hurting him at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And amazement came upon them all, and they began to talk with one another, saying, “What word is this? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And news about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And after he set out from the synagogue, he went into Simon’s house. And Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a high fever, and they asked him on behalf of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she got up and began to serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now as the sun was setting, all who had those who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and placing his hands on every one of them, he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And demons also were coming out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Son of God!” And he rebuked themand did not permit them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And when it was day, he departed and went to an isolated place. And the crowds were seeking him, and came to him and were trying to prevent him from departing from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But he said to them, “It is necessary for me to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
