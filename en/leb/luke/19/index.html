Because you have been faithful in a very small thing, ˻have authority˼ over ten cities.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the second came, saying, ‘Sir, your mina has made five minas.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So he said to this one also, ‘And you be over five cities.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And another came, saying, ‘Sir, behold your mina, which I had put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man—you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He said to him, ‘˻By your own words˼ I will judge you, wicked slave! You knew that I am a severe man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And why did you not give my money to the bank, and I, when I returned, would have collected it with interest?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And to the bystanders he said, ‘Take away from him the mina and give it to the one who has the ten minas!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But these enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And after he had said these things, he traveled on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it happened that when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>saying, ‘Go into the village in front of you, in which as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which ˻no person has ever˼ sat, and untie it and bring it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you will say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So those who were sent went and found it just as he had told them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, ‘Why are you untying the colt?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So they said, ‘The Lord has need of it.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they put Jesus on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And as he was going along, they were spreading out their cloaks on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now as he was drawing near by this time to the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles that they had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>saying,“Blessed is the king,the one who comes in the name of the Lord!Peace in heavenand glory in the highest!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he answered and said, “I tell you, if these keep silent, the stones will cry out!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he approached and saw the city, he wept over it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, “If you had known on this day—even you—the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For days will come upon you and your enemies will put up an embankment against you, and will surround you and press you hard from all directions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And they will raze you to the ground, you and your children within you, and will not leave a stone upon a stone within you, ˻because˼ you did not recognize the time of your visitation.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he entered into the temple courtsand began to drive out those who were selling,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>saying to them, “It is written, ‘And my house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he was teaching every day in the temple courts, and the chief priests and the scribes and the most prominent men of the people were seeking to destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And they did not find anything they could do, because all the people were paying close attention to what they were hearing from him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
