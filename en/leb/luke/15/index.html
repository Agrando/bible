Make me like one of your hired workers.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he set out and came to his own father. But while he was still a long way away, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran ˻and embraced him˼ and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And his son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and ˻in your sight˼! I am no longer worthy to be called your son!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his father said to his slaves, ‘Quickly bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And bring the fattened calf—kill it and let us eat and celebrate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because this son of mine was dead, and is alive again! He was lost and is found!’ And they began to celebrate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“Now his older son was in the field, and when he came and approached the house, he heard music and dancing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he summoned one of the slaves and asked what these things meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has gotten him back healthy.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But he became angry and did not want to go in. So his father came out and began to implore him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he answered and said to his father, ‘Behold, so many years I have served you, and have never disobeyed your command! And you never gave me a young goat so that I could celebrate with my friends!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But when this son of yours returned—who has consumed your assets with prostitutes—you killed the fattened calf for him!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he said to him, ‘Child, you are always with me, and ˻everything I have belongs to you˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But it was necessary to celebrate and to rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead, and is alive, and was lost, and is found!’ ”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
