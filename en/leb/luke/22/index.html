Follow him into the house which he enters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And you will say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he will show you a large furnished upstairs room. Make preparations there.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they went and found everything just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the hour came, he reclined at the table, and the apostles with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, “˻I have earnestly desired˼ to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I tell you that I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he took in hand a cup, andafter giving thanks he said, “Take this and share it among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he took bread, andafter giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And in the same way the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“But behold, the hand of the one who is betraying me is with me on the table!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the Son of Man is going according to what has been determined, but woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they began to debate with one another who then of them it could be who was going to do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And a dispute also occurred among them as to which of them was recognized as being greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he said to them, “The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called benefactors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But you are not to be like this! But the one who is greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the one who leads like the one who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am in your midst as the one who serves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>“And you are the ones who have remained with me in my trials,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred on me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail. And you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you have denied three times that you know me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them, “When I sent you out without a money bag and a traveler’s bag and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?” And they said, “Nothing.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said to them, “But now the one who has a money bag must take it, and likewise a traveler’s bag. And the one who does not have a sword must sell his cloak and buy one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For I tell you that this that is written must be fulfilled in me: ‘And he was counted with the criminals.’ For indeed, what is written about me ˻is being fulfilled˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So they said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords!” And he said to them, “It is adequate.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went away and proceeded, according to his custom, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when he came to the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not enter into temptation.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw and ˻knelt down˼and began to pray,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, “Father, if you are willing, take away this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will but yours be done.” 〚</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And an angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And being in anguish, he began praying more fervently and his sweat became like drops of blood falling down to the ground.〛</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he got up from the prayer and came to the disciples, he found them sleeping from sorrow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you will not enter into temptation!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>While he was still speaking, behold, there came a crowd, and the one named Judas, one of the twelve, leading them. And he approached Jesus to kiss him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But Jesus said to him, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And when those around him saw what was about to happen, they said, “Lord, should we strike with the sword?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And a certain one of them struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But Jesus answered and said, “˻Stop! No more of this!˼” And he touched his ear and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to the chief priests and officers of the temple and elders who had come out against him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Every day when I was with you in the temple courts, you did not stretch out your hands against me! But this is your hour and the domain of darkness!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And they arrested him and led him away and brought him into the house of the high priest. But Peter was following at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And a certain female slave, seeing him sitting in the light and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And after a short time another person saw him and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And after about one hour had passed, someone else was insisting, saying, “In truth this man also was with him, because he is also a Galilean!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about!” And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And the Lord turned around and looked intently at Peter. And Peter remembered the Lord’s statement, how he said to him, “Before the rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And he went outside and wept bitterly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the men who were guarding him began to mock him while they beat him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>and after blindfolding him they repeatedly asked him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And they were saying many other things against him, reviling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And when day came, the council of elders of the people gathered, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away to their Sanhedrin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>saying, “If you are the Christ, tell us!” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will never believe,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>and if I ask you, you will never answer!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>So they all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” And he said to them, “You say that I am.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And they said, “Why do we have need of further testimony? For we ourselves have heard it from his mouth!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
