Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, then will he find faith on earth?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and looked down on ˻everyone else˼:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The Pharisee stood and prayed these things with reference to himself: ‘God, I give thanks to you that I am not like other people—swindlers, unrighteous people, adulterers, or even like this tax collector!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the tax collector, standing far away, did not want even to raise his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than that one! For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now they were bringing even their babies to him so that he could touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But Jesus called them to himself, saying, “Allow the children to come to me, and do not forbid them, ˻for to such belongs˼ the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Truly I say to you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, by doing what will I inherit eternal life?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said, “All these I have observed from my youth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he heard this, Jesus said to him, “˻You still lack one thing˼: Sell all that you have, and distribute the proceeds to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But when he heard these things he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when Jesus saw him becoming very sad, he said, “How ˻difficult it is for˼ those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So those who heard this said, “And who can be saved?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he said, “What is impossible with men is possible with God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Peter said, “Behold, we have left ˻all that is ours˼and followed you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, “Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children on account of the kingdom of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who will not receive many times more in this time and in the age to come, eternal life.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And taking aside the twelve, he said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written by the prophets with reference to the Son of Man will be accomplished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and mistreated and spit on,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and after flogging him they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And they understood none of these things, and this saying was concealed from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now it happened that as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting on the side of the road begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he heard a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they told him, “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he called out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who were in front rebuked him, that he should be silent, but he cried out ˻even more loudly˼, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So Jesus stopped and ordered him to be brought to him. And when he approached, he asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>“What do you want me to do for you?” And he said, “Lord, that I may regain my sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And Jesus said to him, “Regain your sight! Your faith has saved you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately he regained his sight and began to follow him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
