And behold, nothing deserving death ˻has been done˼ by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore I will punish him and release him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But they all cried out in unison, saying, “Take this man away, and release for us Barabbas!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(who had been thrown in prison because of a certain insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but they kept crying out, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he said to them a third time, “Why? What wrong has this man done? I found no basis for an accusation ˻deserving death˼ in him. Therefore I will punish him and release him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he be crucified. And their cries prevailed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he released the one who had been thrown into prison because of insurrection and murder, whom they were asking for, but Jesus he handed over to their will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as they led him away, they seized Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and placed the cross on him, to carry it behind Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And a great crowd of the people were following him, and of women who were mourning and lamenting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For behold, days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not give birth, and the breasts that did not nurse!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For if they do these things˻when the wood is green˼, what will happen ˻when it is dry˼?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they came to the place that is called “The Skull,” there they crucified him, and the criminals, the one on his right and the other on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>〚But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”〛 And they cast lots to divide his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And the people stood there watching, but the rulers also ridiculed him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if this man is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And there was also an inscription over him, “This is the king of the Jews.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And one of the criminals who were hanged there reviled him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself—and us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But the other answered and rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, because you are undergoing the same condemnation?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving ˻what we deserve˼for what we have done. But this man has done nothing wrong!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And he said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And by this time it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>becausethe light of the sun failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn apart down the middle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit!” And after he said this, he expired.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began to praise God, saying, “Certainly this man was righteous!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And all the crowds that had come together for this spectacle, when they saw the things that had happened, returned home beating their breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee who saw these things, stood at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And behold, a man ˻named˼ Joseph, who was a member of the council and a good and righteous man</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>(this man was not consenting to their plan and deed), from Arimathea, ˻a Judean town˼, who was looking forward to the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth and placed him in a tomb cut into the rock where no one had ever been placed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And it was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And the women who had been accompanying him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was placed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And they returned and prepared fragrant spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
