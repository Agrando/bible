Now by this time he was not far away from the house, and the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy that you should come in under my roof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For this reason neither did I consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and my slave must be healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For I also am a man placed under authority, who has soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning around to the crowd that was following him, he said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when they returned to the house, those who had been sent found the slave healthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened that on the next day he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he approached the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, his mother’s only son, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he came up and touched the bier, and those who were carrying it stopped. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fear seized them all, and they began to glorify God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us!” and “God has visited to help his people!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And this report about him went out in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And his disciples reported to John about all these things. And summoning a certain two of his disciples, John</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the men came to him, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that hour he healed many people of diseases and suffering and evil spirits, and he granted sight to many blind people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he answered and said to them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised, the poor have good news announced to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are in splendid clothing and luxury are in the royal palaces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>It is this man about whom it is written:‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I tell you, there is no one greater among those born of women than John, but the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(And all the people, when they heard this—even the tax collectors—affirmed the righteousness of God, because they had been baptized with the baptism of John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>but the Pharisees and the legal experts rejected the purpose of God for themselves, because they had not been baptized by him.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another, who say,‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance;we sang a lament and you did not weep.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For John the Baptist has come not eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he entered into the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And behold, a woman in the town who was a sinner, when she learned that he was dining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of perfumed oil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and standing behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and was wiping them with the hair of her head and was kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfumed oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now when the Pharisee who invited him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he said, “Teacher, say it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>“There were two debtors who owed a certain creditor. One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>When they were not able to repay him, he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Simon answered and said, “I suppose that it is the one to whom he forgave more.” And he said to him, “You have judged correctly.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house. You did not give me water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You did not give me a kiss, but from the time I entered, she has not stopped kissing my feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she anointed my feet with perfumed oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>˻For this reason˼ I tell you, her sins—which were many—have been forgiven, for she loved much. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And those who were reclining at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
