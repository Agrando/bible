If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times he returns to you saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the Lord said, “If you have faith like a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>“And which of you who has a slave plowing or shepherding sheep who comes in from the field will say to him, ‘Come here at once and recline at the table’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare something that I may eat, and dress yourself to serve me while I eat and drink, and after these things you will eat and drink.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He will not ˻be grateful˼ to the slave because he did what was ordered, will he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus you also, when you have done all the ˻things you were ordered to do˼, say, ‘We are unworthy slaves; we have done what we were obligated to do.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it happened that while traveling toward Jerusalem, he was passing through ˻the region between˼ Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he was entering into a certain village, ten men met him—lepers, who stood at a distance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they raised their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And it happened that as they were going, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he fell on his face at his feet, giving thanks to him. And he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Jesus answered and said, “Were not ten cleansed? And where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Was no one found to turn back and give praise to God except this foreigner?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, “Get up and go your way. Your faith has saved you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them and said, “The kingdom of God does not come with ˻things that can be observed˼,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>nor will they say, ‘Behold, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ For behold, the kingdom of God is in your midst.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to the disciples, “Days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they will say to you, ‘Behold, there!’ or ‘Behold, here!’ Do not go out or run after them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For just as the lightning shines forth, flashing from one place under heaven to another place under heaven, so the Son of Man will be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things, and to be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And just as it was in the days of Noah, so also it will be in the days of the Son of Man—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot—they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>It will be ˻just the same˼ on the day that the Son of Man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>On that day, whoever is on the housetop and his goods are in the house must not come down to take them away. And likewise the one who is in the field must not turn back</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot’s wife!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever seeks to preserve his life will lose it, but whoever loses it will keep it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you that in that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken and the other will be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>There will be two women grinding at the same place; one will be taken and the other will be left.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they answered and said to him, “Where, Lord?” So he said to them, “Where the dead body is, there also the vultures will be gathered.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
