Yes, I tell you, fear this one!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But even the hairs of your head are all numbered! Do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“And I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before people, the Son of Man also will acknowledge him before the angels of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but the one who denies me before people will be denied before the angels of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him, but to the one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they bring you before the synagogues and the rulers and the authorities, do not be anxious how or what you should speak in your own defense or what you should say,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that same hour what it is necessary to say.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But he said to him, “Man, who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, “Watch out and guard yourselves from all greediness, because not even when someone has an abundance ˻does˼ his life consist of his possessions.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he told a parable to them, saying, “The land of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he reasoned to himself, saying, ‘What should I do? For I do not have anywhere I can gather in my crops.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build larger ones, and I will gather in there all my grain and possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will say to my soul, “Soul, you have many possessions stored up for many years. Relax, eat, drink, celebrate!” ’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But God said to him, ‘Fool! This night your life is demanded from you, and the things which you have prepared—whose will they be?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So is the one who stores up treasure for himself, and who is not rich toward God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to his disciples, “For this reason I tell you, do not be anxious for your life, what you will eat, or for your body, what you will wear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Consider the ravens, that they neither sow nor reap; to them there is neither storeroom nor barn, and God feeds them. How much more are you worth than the birds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And which of you by being anxious is able to add an hour to his life span?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>If then you are not even able to do a very little thing, why are you anxious about the rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Consider the lilies, how they grow: they do not toil or spin, but I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if God clothes the grass in the field in this way, although it is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, how much more will he do so for you, you of little faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And you, do not consider what you will eat and what you will drink, and do not be anxious.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For all the nations of the world seek after these things, and your Father knows that you need these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But seek his kingdom and these things will be added to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>“Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father is well pleased to give you the kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Sell your possessions and give charitable gifts. Make for yourselves money bags that do not wear out, an inexhaustible treasure in heaven where thief does not approach or moth destroy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>“˻You must be prepared for action˼ and your lamps burning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And you, be like people who are waiting for their master when he returns from the wedding feast, so that when he comes back and knocks, they can open the door for him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find on the alert when he returns! Truly I say to you that he will dress himself for service and have them recline at the table and will come by and serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Even if he should come back in the second or in the third watch of the night and find them like this, blessed are they!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But understand this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief was coming, he would not have left his house to be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>You also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Peter said, “Lord, are you telling this parable for us, or also for everyone?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the Lord said, “Who then is the faithful wise manager whom the master will put in charge over his servants to give themtheir food allowance at the right time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he comes back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But if that slave should say ˻to himself˼, ‘My master is taking a long time to return,’ and he begins to beat the male slaves and the female slaves and to eat and drink and get drunk,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know, and will cut him in two and assign his place with the unbelievers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And that slave who knew the will of his master and did not prepare or do according to his will ˻will be given a severe beating˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But the one who did not know and did things deserving blows ˻will be given a light beating˼. And from everyone to whom much has been given, much will be demanded, and from him to whom they entrusted much, they will ask him for even more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>“I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish that it had been kindled already!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am distressed until it is accomplished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Do you think that I have come to grant peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For from now on there will be five in one household, divided three against two and two against three.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And he also said to the crowds, “When you see a cloud coming up in the west, you say at once, ‘A rainstorm is coming,’ and so it happens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And when you see the south wind blowing, you say, ‘There will be burning heat,’ and it happens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Hypocrites! You know how to evaluate the appearance of the earth and the sky, but how is it you do not know how to evaluate this present time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And why do you not also judge for yourselves what is right?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>For as you are going with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to come to a settlement with him on the way, so that he will not drag you to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the bailiff, and the bailiff will throw you into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>I tell you, you will never get out of there until you have paid back even the last cent!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
