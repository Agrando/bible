For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and ‘The time is near!’ Do not go after them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when you hear about wars and insurrections, do not be terrified, for these things must happen first, but the end will not be at once.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then he said to them, “nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>There will be great earthquakes and famines and plagues in various places. There will be terrible sights and great signs from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and will persecute you, handing you over to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and governors because of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This will turn out to you for a time of witness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>˻Therefore make up your minds˼ not to prepare in advance to speak in your own defense,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>for I will give you a mouth and wisdom that all your opponents will not be able to resist or contradict.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you will be handed over even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends, and they will put to death some of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And you will be hated by all because of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Even a hair of your head will never perish!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>By your patient endurance you will gain your lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>“But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains, and those ˻inside it˼ must depart, and those in the fields must not enter into it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>because these are days of vengeance, so that all the things that are written can be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Woe to those ˻who are pregnant˼ and to those who are nursing their babies in those days! For there will be great distress on the earth and wrath against this people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they will fall by the edge of the sword, and will be led captive into all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“And there will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and on the earth distress of nations in perplexity from the noise of the sea and its surging,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>people fainting from fear and expectation of what is coming on the inhabited earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then they will see the Son of Man arriving in a cloud with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But when these things begin to happen, stand up straight and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When they put out foliage, now you see for yourselves and know that by this time the summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So also you, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all things take place!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>“But take care for yourselves, lest your hearts are weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of daily life, and that day come upon you suddenly</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>like a trap.
