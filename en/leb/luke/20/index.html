But the tenant farmers sent him away empty-handed after beating him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he proceeded to send another slave, but they beat and dishonored that one also, and sent him away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he proceeded to send a third, but they wounded and threw out this one also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the tenant farmers saw him, they began to reason with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance will become ours!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.” And when they heard this, they said, “May this never happen!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But he looked intently at them and said, “What then is this that is written:‘The stone which the builders rejected,this has become ˻the cornerstone˼.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay their hands on him at that same hour, and they were afraid of the people, for they knew that he had told this parable with reference to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended they were upright, in order that they could catch him in a statement, so that they could hand him over to the authority and the jurisdiction of the governor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they asked him, saying, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and do not ˻show partiality˼, but teach the way of God in truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Is it permitted for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But seeing through their craftiness, he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“Show me a denarius! Whose image and inscription does it have?” And they said, “Caesar’s.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So he said to them, “Well then, give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were not able to catch him in a statement in the sight of the people, and astonished at his answer, they became silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now some of the Sadducees—who deny ˻that there is a resurrection˼—came up and asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us if someone’s brother dies having a wife, and this man is childless, that his brother should take the wife and ˻father˼ descendants for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife and died childless,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the second,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and the third took her, and likewise also the seven did not leave children and died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Finally the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore in the resurrection, the woman—whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>for they are not even able to die any longer, because they are like the angels and are sons of God, because they are sons of the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But that the dead are raised, even Moses revealed in the passage about the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For they no longer dared to ask him anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But he said to them, “In what sense do they say that the Christ is David’s son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For David himself says in the book of Psalms,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>until I make your enemiesa footstool for your feet.” ’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>David therefore calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>“Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
