And ˻he had a wife˼ from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they were both righteous in the sight of God, living blamelessly in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And ˻they did not have˼ a child, because Elizabeth was barren. And they were both advanced ˻in years˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the whole crowd of the people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Zechariah was terrified when he saw the angel, and fear fell upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the angel said to him,“Do not be afraid, Zechariah,because your prayer has been heard,and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,and you will call his name John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And ˻you will experience joy and exultation˼,and many will rejoice at his birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord,and he must never drink wine or beer,and he will be filled with the Holy Spiritwhile he is still in his mother’s womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he will turn many of the sons of Israelto the Lord their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he will go on before himin the spirit and power of Elijah,to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous,to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Zechariah said to the angel, “By what will I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced ˻in years˼!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the angel answered and said to him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, ˻because˼ you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and began to wonder when he was delayed in the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he came out he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them, and remained unable to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it happened that when the days of his service came to an end, he went away to his home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>“Thus the Lord has done for me in the days in which he has concerned himself with me, to take away my disgrace among people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee ˻named˼ Nazareth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>to a virgin legally promised in marriage to a man ˻named˼ Joseph of the house of David. And the name of the virgin was Mary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But she was greatly perplexed at the statement, and was pondering what sort of greeting this might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the angel said to her,“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And behold, you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son,and you will call his name Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This one will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High,and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he will reign over the house of Jacob ˻forever˼,and of his kingdom there will be no end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel answered and said to her,“The Holy Spirit will come upon you,and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.Therefore also the one to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And behold, your relative Elizabeth—she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For ˻nothing will be impossible with God˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So Mary said, “Behold, the Lord’s female slave! May it happen to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now in those days Mary set out and traveled with haste into the hill country, to a town of Judah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and entered into the house of Zechariah, and greeted Elizabeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And it happened that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby in her womb leaped and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And she cried out with a loud shout and said,“Blessed are you among women,and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And blessed is she who believed that there will be a fulfillment to what was spoken to her from the Lord!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And Mary said,“My soul exalts the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and my spirit has rejoiced greatly in God my Savior,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>because he has looked upon the humble state of his female slave,for behold, from now on all generations will consider me blessed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>because the Mighty One has done great things for me,and holy is his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And his mercy is for generation after generationto those who fear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>He has done a mighty deed with his arm;he has dispersed the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>He has brought down rulers from their thrones,and has exalted the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>He has filled those who are hungry with good things,and those who are rich he has sent away empty-handed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>He has helped Israel his servant,remembering his mercy,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>just as he spoke to our fathers,to Abraham and to his descendants ˻forever˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now the time came for Elizabeth that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>And her neighbors and relatives heard that ˻the Lord had shown his great mercy to her˼, and they rejoiced with her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were wanting to name him ˻after˼ his father Zechariah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And his mother answered and said, “No, but he will be named John.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>And they said to her, “There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>So they made signs to his father asking what he wanted him to be named,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>and he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, “John is his name.” And they were all astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>And his mouth and his tongue were opened immediately, and he began to speak, praising God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And fear came on all those who lived near them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these events were discussed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And all those who heard kept these things in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,because he has visited to help and ˻has redeemed˼ his people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>and has raised up a horn of salvation for usin the house of his servant David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>just as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>to show mercy to our fathersand to remember his holy covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>the oath that he swore to Abraham our father,to grant us</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,could serve him without fear</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>in holiness and righteousnessbefore him all our days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="76">76</a>And so you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High,for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="77">77</a>to give knowledge of salvation to his peopleby the forgiveness of their sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="78">78</a>because of the merciful compassion of our Godby which the dawn will visit to help us from on high,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="79">79</a>to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,to direct our feet into the way of peace.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="80">80</a>And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
