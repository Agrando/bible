For their fathers used to do the same things to the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>“But woe to you who are rich,because you have received your comfort.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Woe to you who are satisfied now,because you will be hungry.Woe, you who laugh now,because you will mourn and weep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Woe whenever all people speak well of you,for their fathers used to do the same things to the false prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>“But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>To the one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also, and from the one who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Give to everyone who asks you, and from the one who takes away your things, do not ask for them back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And just as you want people ˻to do˼ to you, do ˻the same˼ to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>“And if you love those who love you, what kind of credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For even if you do good to those who do good to you, what kind of credit is that to you? Even the sinners do the same!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And if you lend to those from whom you expect to receive back, what kind of credit is that to you? Even sinners lend to sinners, so that they may get back an equal amount!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But love your enemies, and do good, and lend expecting back nothing, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Be merciful, just as your Father also is merciful!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>“And do not judge, and you will never be judged. And do not condemn, and you will never be condemned. Pardon, and you will be pardoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Give, and it will be given to you, a good measure—pressed down, shaken, overflowing—they will pour out into your lap. For with the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you in return.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he also told them a parable: “Surely a blind person cannot lead the blind, can he? Will they not both fall into a pit?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>A disciple is not superior to his teacher, but everyone, when he is fully trained, will be like his teacher.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the beam of wood that is in your own eye?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>How are you able to say to your brother, “Brother, allow me to remove the speck that is in your eye,” while you yourself do not see the beam of wood in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the beam of wood from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck that is in your brother’s eye!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>“For there is no good tree that produces bad fruit, nor on the other hand a bad tree that produces good fruit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorn plants, nor are grapes harvested from thorn bushes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>The good person out of the good treasury of his heart brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasury brings forth evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>“And why do you call me ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I tell you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>“Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and does them—I will show you what he is like:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>he is like a man building a house, who dug and went down deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the river burst against that house and was not able to shake it, because it had been built well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But the one who hears my words and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation, which the river burst against, and immediately it collapsed—and the collapse of that house was great!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
