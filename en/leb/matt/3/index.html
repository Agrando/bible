Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentence!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Already now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I baptize you with water for repentence, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean out his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John in order to be baptized by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But John tried to prevent him, saying, “˻I need˼ to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it now, for in this way it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permitted him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now after he was baptized, Jesus immediately went up from the water, and behold, the heavens opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And behold, there was a voice from heaven saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
