Come, see the place where he was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And go quickly, tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and behold, he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Behold, I have told you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go tell my brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And while they were going, behold, some of the guard of soldiers went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after they had assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a rather large sum of money to the soldiers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>telling them, “Say ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And if this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and ˻keep you out of trouble˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they took the money and did as they were told, and spread abroad this report among the Jews until this very day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>teaching them to observe everything I have commanded you, and behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
