But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Jesus came to the region of Caesarea ˻Philippi˼, he began asking his disciples, saying, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they said, ˻Some˼say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he commanded the disciples that they should tell no one that he was the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised on the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, ˻God forbid˼, Lord! This will never happen to you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he turned around and said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a cause for stumbling to me, because you are not intent on the things of God, but the things of people!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me will find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For what will a person be benefited if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what will a person give in exchange for his life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For the Son of Man is going to come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and at that time he will reward each one according to ˻what he has done˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
