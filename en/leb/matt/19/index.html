Therefore what God has joined together, man must not separate.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to him, “Why then did Moses command us to give a document—a certificate of divorce—and to divorce her?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He said to them, “Moses, with reference to your hardness of heart, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not like this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the basis of sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>His disciples said to him, “If this is the case of a man with his wife, it would be better not to marry!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, “Not everyone can accept this saying but those to whom it has been given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For there are eunuchs who were born as such from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by people, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. The one who is able to accept this, let him accept it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then children were brought to him so that he could lay his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Jesus said, “Allow the children, and do not forbid them to come to me, ˻for to such belongs˼ the kingdom of heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he laid his hands on them and traveled on from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And behold, someone came up to him and said, “Teacher, what good thing must I do so that I will have eternal life?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to him, “Why are you asking me about what is good? There is one who is good. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He said to him, “Which ones?” And Jesus said, “Do not commit murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The young man said to him, “All these I have observed. What do I still lack?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give the proceeds to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the young man heard the statement, he went away sorrowful, because he was one who had many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I say to you that with difficulty a rich person will enter into the kingdom of heaven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So when the disciples heard this, they were extremely amazed, saying, “Then who can be saved?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Jesus looked at themand said to them, “With human beings this is impossible, but with God all thingsare possible.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then Peter answered and said to him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the renewal of the world, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me—you also will sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields on account of my name will receive a hundred times as much, and will inherit eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
