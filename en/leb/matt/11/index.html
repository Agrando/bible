A reed shaken by the wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in the houses of kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It is this man about whom it is written:‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist. But the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of heaven is treated violently, and the violent claim it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah, the one who is going to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The one who has ears, let him hear!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>saying,‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance;we sang a lament and you did not mourn.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold, a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then he began to reproach the towns in which the majority of his miracles had been done, because they did not repent:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and for Sidon on the day of judgment than for you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? No, you will be brought down to Hades! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Nevertheless I tell you that it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>At that time Jesus answered and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to young children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Yes, Father, for to do so ˻was your gracious will˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and ˻anyone to whom˼ the Son wants to reveal him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Come to me, all of you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For my yoke is easy to carry and my burden is light.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
