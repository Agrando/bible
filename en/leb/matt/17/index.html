If you want, I will make here three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the disciples heard this, they fell down on their faces and were extremely frightened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jesus came and touched them and said, “Get up and do not be afraid.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when they lifted up their eyes they saw no one except him—Jesus alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them saying, “Tell no one the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the disciples asked him, saying, “Then why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he answered and said, “Elijah indeed is coming, and will restore all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But I say to you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did with him whatever they wanted. In the same way also the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they came to the crowd, a man approached him, kneeling down before him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers severely, for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answered and said, “O unbelieving and perverse generation! ˻How long˼ will I be with you? ˻How long˼ must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him and the boy was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said, ˻Why˼ were we not able to expel it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you have faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now as they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised.” And they were extremely distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when they arrived in Capernaum, the ones who collected the double drachma tax came up to Peter and said, “Does your teacher not pay the double drachma tax?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He said, “Yes.” And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth collect tolls or taxes—from their own sons, or from foreigners?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him, “Then the sons are free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But so that we do not give offense to them, go out to the sea, cast a line with a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a four-drachma coin. Take that and give it to them for me and you.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
