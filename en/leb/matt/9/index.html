But days are coming when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But no one puts a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment, for its patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear becomes worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins. ˻Otherwise˼ the wineskins burst and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As he was saying these things to them, behold, one of the rulers came and knelt down before him, saying, “My daughter has just now died, but come, place your hand on her and she will live!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, a woman who had been suffering with a hemorrhage twelve years approached from behind and touched the edge of his cloak,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>for she said to herself, “If only I touch his cloak I will be healed.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly crowd,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>he said, “Go away, because the girl is not dead, but is sleeping.” And they ridiculed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when the crowd had been sent out, he entered and took her hand, and the girl got up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And this report went out into that whole region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as Jesus was going away from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when he came into the house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be done for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And their eyes were opened, and Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one finds out.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But they went out and spread the report about him in that whole region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now as they were going away, behold, they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was unable to speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after the demon had been expelled, the one who had been mute spoke, and the crowds were astonished, saying, “˻This has never been seen before˼ in Israel!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But the Pharisees were saying, “By the ruler of demons he expels the demons!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Jesus was going around all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were weary and dejected, like sheep that did not have a shepherd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
