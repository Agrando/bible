And his disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck off heads of grain and eat them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, “Behold, your disciples are doing what it is not permitted to do on the Sabbath!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So he said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>how he entered into the house of God and ate the bread of the presentation, which it was not permitted for him or for those with him to eat, but only for the priests?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the sanctity of the Sabbath and are guiltless?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But I tell you that something greater than the temple is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And if you had known what ˻it means˼, ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And going on from there he came into their synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying, “Is it permitted to heal on the Sabbath?” in order that they could accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But he said to them, “What man will there be among you who will have one sheep and if this one fell into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then to what degree is a man worth more than a sheep? So then, it is permitted to do good on the Sabbath.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand,” and he stretched it out, and it was restored as healthy as the other one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the Pharisees went out ˻and plotted˼ against him in order that they could destroy him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now Jesus, when he learned of it, withdrew from there, and many crowds followed him, and he healed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he warned them that they should not ˻reveal his identity˼,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“Behold my servant whom I have chosen,my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased.I will put my Spirit on him,and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He will not quarrel or cry out,nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>A crushed reed he will not break,and a smoldering wick he will not extinguish,until he brings justice to victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And in his name the Gentiles will hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute was brought to him. And he healed him so that the man who was mute could speak and see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the crowds were amazed and began saying, “Perhaps this one is the Son of David!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But the Pharisees, when they heard it, said, “This man does not expel demons except by Beelzebul the ruler of demons!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But knowing their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan expels Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if I expel demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons expel them? For this reason they will be your judges!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if I expel demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or how can someone enter into the house of a strong man and steal his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? And then he can thoroughly plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The one who is not with me is against me, and the one who does not gather with me scatters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For this reason I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him either in this age or in the coming one!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>“Either make the tree good and its fruit is good, or make the tree bad and its fruit is bad, for the tree is known by its fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Offspring of vipers! How are you able to say good things when you are evil? For from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The good person from his good treasury brings out good things, and the evil person from his evil treasury brings out evil things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>But I tell you that every worthless word that they speak, people will give an account for it on the day of judgment!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For by your words you will be vindicated, and by your words you will be condemned.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But he answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation desires a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For just as Jonah was in the belly of the huge fish three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the proclamation of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>The queen of the south will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>“Now whenever an unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it travels through waterless places searching for rest, and does not find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came out.’ And when it arrives it finds the house unoccupied and swept and put in order.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then it goes and brings along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. And the last state of that person becomes worse than the first. So it will be for this evil generation also!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>While he was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brothers were standing there outside, desiring to speak to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And someone told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers are standing there outside desiring to speak to you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But he answered and said to the one who told him, “Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Behold my mother and my brothers!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For whoever does the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother and sister and mother.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
