For we have seen his star at its rising and have come to worship him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And when King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and after calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ was to be born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,are by no means least among the rulers of Judah,for from you will go out a rulerwho will shepherd my people Israel.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and determined precisely from them the time when the star appeared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go, inquire carefully concerning the child, and when you have found him, report to me so that I also may come and worship him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After they listened to the king, they went out, and behold, the star which they had seen at its rising led them until it came and stood above the place where the child was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they came into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. And opening their treasure boxes, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by another route.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now after they had gone away, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So he got up and took the child and his mother during the night and went away to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was said by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying,“Out of Egypt I called my son.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deceived by the wise men, became very angry, and he sent soldiersand executed all the children in Bethlehem and in all the region around it from the age of two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined precisely from the wise men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“A voice was heard in Ramah,weeping and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children,and she did not want to be comforted,because ˻they exist no longer˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now after Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he got up and took the child and his mother and ˻entered˼ the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream, he took refuge in the regions of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he came and lived in a town called Nazareth, in order that what was said by the prophets would be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
