Come to the wedding celebration!” ’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But they paid no attention and went away—this one to his own field, that one to his business.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the others, seizing his slaves, mistreated them and killed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king was angry and sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to his slaves, ‘The wedding celebration is ready, but those who had been invited were not worthy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore, go out to the places where the roads exit the city and invite to the wedding celebration as many people as you find.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And those slaves went out into the roads and gathered everyone whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding celebration was filled ˻with dinner guests˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when the king came in to see the ˻dinner guests˼, he saw a man there not dressed in wedding clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here, not having wedding clothes?’ But ˻he could say nothing˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the king said to the servants, ‘Tie him up ˻hand and foot˼and throw him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For many are called but few are chosen.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the Pharisees went ˻and consulted˼ so that they could entrap him with a statement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they sent their disciples to him with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and ˻you do not care what anyone thinks˼, ˻because you do not regard the opinion of people˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore tell us what you think. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But because he knew their maliciousness, Jesus said, “Hypocrites! Why are you testing me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Show me the coin for the tax!” So they brought him a denarius.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They said to him, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when they heard this, they were astonished, and they left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On that day Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and asked him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, “Teacher, Moses said if someone dies without having children, his brother is to marry his wife and ˻father˼ descendants for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first died after getting married, and because he did not have descendants, he left his wife to his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So also the second and the third, up to the seventh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And last of all the woman died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her as wife.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>“I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled at the same place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And one of them, a legal expert, put a question to him to test him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>“Teacher, which commandment is greatest in the law?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is the greatest and first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Now while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “David’s.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He said to them, “How then does David, by the Spirit, call him ‘Lord,’ saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right handuntil I put your enemiesunder your feet” ’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him any more questions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
