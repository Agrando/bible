Untie themand bring them to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if anyone says anything to you, you will say, ‘The Lord ˻needs them˼,’ and he will send them at once.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Now this took place so that what was spoken through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>“Say to the daughter of Zion,‘Behold, your king is coming to you,humble and mounted on a donkey,and on a colt, the foal of a pack animal.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So the disciples went and did just as Jesus directed them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the crowds who went ahead of him and the ones who followed were shouting, saying,“Hosanna to the Son of David!Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when he entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, “Who is this?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth of Galilee!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jesus entered the temple courts and drove out all those who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who were selling doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he said to them, “It is written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the blind and the lame came up to him in the temple courts and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children shouting in the temple courts and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they said to him, “Do you hear what these children are saying?” So Jesus said to them, “Yes, have you never read, ‘Out of the mouths of children and nursing babies you have prepared for yourself praise’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And leaving them, he went outside of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now early in the morning, as he was returning to the city, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And seeing a single fig tree by the road, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And he said to it, “May there be no more fruit from you ˻forever˼, and the fig tree withered at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they saw it, the disciples were astonished, saying, “How did the fig tree wither at once?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will do not only what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,” it will happen!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And whatever you ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after he arrived at the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him while he was teaching, saying, “By what authority are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, “I also will ask you one question. If you tell the answer to me, I also will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>From where was the baptism of John—from heaven or from men?” And they began to discuss this among themselves, saying, “If we say ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if we say, ‘From men,’ we are afraid of the crowd, because they all look upon John as a prophet.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they answered and said to Jesus, “We do not know.” And he said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>“Now what do you think? A man had two sons. And he approached the first and said, ‘Son, go work in the vineyard today.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he answered and said, ‘I do not want to!’ But later he changed his mind and went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he approached the other and said the same thing. So he answered and said, ‘I will, sir,’ and he did not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are going ahead of you into the kingdom of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did believe him. And when you saw it, you did not even change your minds later so as to believe in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>“Listen to another parable: There was a man—a master of a house—who planted a vineyard, and put a fence around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when the season of fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the tenant farmers to collect his fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the tenant farmers seized his slaves, one of whom they beat, and one of whom they killed, and one of whom they stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Again, he sent other slaves, more than the first ones, and they did the same thing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>So finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But when the tenant farmers saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they seized him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now when the master of the vineyard arrives, what will he do to those tenant farmers?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>They said to him, “He will destroy those evil men completely and lease the vineyard to other tenant farmers who will give him the fruits in their season.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Jesus said to them, “Have you never read in the scriptures,‘The stone which the builders rejected,this has become ˻the cornerstone˼.This came about from the Lord,and it is marvelous in our eyes’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>For this reason, I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a people who produce its fruits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking about them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>and although they wanted to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, because they looked upon him as a prophet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
