For you do not enter, nor permit those wanting to go in to enter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees—hypocrites!—because you travel around the sea and the dry land to make one convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing!
