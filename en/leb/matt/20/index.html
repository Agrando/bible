And going out again about the sixth and ninth hour he did the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing there and said to them, ‘Why are you standing here the whole day unemployed?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go also into the vineyard.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning from the last up to the first.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when the ones hired about the eleventh hour came, they received a denarius apiece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, and they also received a denarius apiece.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they received it, they began to complain against the master of the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying, ‘These last people worked one hour and you made them equal to us who have endured the burden of the day and the burning heat!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But he answered one of them and said, ‘Friend, I am not doing you wrong. Did you not come to an agreement with me for a denarius?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Take what is yours and go! But I want to give to this last personthe same as I gave to you also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Or is it not permitted for me to do whatever I want with what is mine? Or is your eye evil because I am generous?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus the last will be first and the first last.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples by themselves and said to them on the way,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and will hand him over to the Gentiles to mock him and flog him and crucify him, and on the third day he will be raised.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling down she asked something of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he said to her, “What do you want?” She said to him, “Say that these two sons of mine may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your kingdom.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But Jesus answered and said, “You do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” They said to him, “We are able.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He said to them, “You will indeed drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left—this is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when the ten heard this, they were indignant concerning the two brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus called them to himself and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>It will not be like this among you! But whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be your slave—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as they were going out of Jericho, a large crowd followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And behold, there were two blind men sitting beside the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they called out, saying, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the crowd rebuked them so that they would be quiet. But they called out all the more, saying, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus stopped, called them, and said, “What do you want me to do for you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>They said to him, “Lord, that our eyes be opened!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And having compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
