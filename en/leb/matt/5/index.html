But if salt becomes tasteless, by what will it be made salty? It is good for nothing any longer except to be thrown outside and trampled under foot by people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You are the light of the world. A city located on top of a hill cannot be hidden,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>nor do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the same way let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>“Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to fulfill them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one tiny letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all takes place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore whoever abolishes one of the least of these commandments and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps them and teaches them, this person will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For I say to you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>“You have heard that it was said to the ˻people of old˼, ‘Do not commit murder,’ and ‘whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But I say to you that everyone who is angry at his brother will be subject to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, ‘Stupid fool!’ will be subject to the council, and whoever says, ‘Obstinate fool!’ will be subject to fiery hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore if you present your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>leave your gift there before the altar and first go be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your gift.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>˻Settle the case quickly with your accuser˼ while you are with him on the way, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Truly I say to you, you will never come out of there until you have paid back the last penny!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your members be destroyed than your whole body be thrown into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your limbs be destroyed than your whole body go into hell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“And it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>“Again you have heard that it was said to the ˻people of old˼, ‘Do not swear falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But I say to you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, because it is the throne of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>or by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And do not swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But let your statement be ‘Yes, yes; no, no,’ and anything beyond these is from the evil one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer, but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And the one who wants to go to court with you and take your tunic, ˻let him have˼ your outer garment also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘Hate your enemy.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, because he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not the tax collectors also do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing that is remarkable? Do not the Gentiles also do the same?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Therefore you be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
