For they do not wash their hands when they eat ˻a meal˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So he answered and said to them, “Why do you also break the commandment of God because of your tradition?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother ˻must certainly die˼.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or his mother, “Whatever ˻benefit you would have received˼ from me is a gift to God,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>need not honor his father,’ and you make void the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Hypocrites! Isaiah correctly prophesied about you saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>‘This people honors me with their lips,but their heart is far, far away from me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and they worship me in vain,teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And summoning the crowd, he said to them, “Hear and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth—this defiles a person.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he answered and said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Let them! They are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But Peter answered and said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But he said, “Are you also still without understanding?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Do you not understand that everything that enters into the mouth goes into the stomach and is evacuated into the latrine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these defile the person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For from the heart come evil plans, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, abusive speech.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>These are the things that defile a person. But eating with unwashed hands does not defile a person!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And departing from there, Jesus went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, a Canaanite woman from that district came and cried out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came up and asked him, saying, “Send her away, because she is crying out after us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But he answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But she came and knelt down before him, saying, “Lord, help me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he answered and said, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So she said, “Yes, Lord, for even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain and was sitting there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And large crowds came to him, having with them the lame, blind, crippled, mute, and many others, and they put them down at his feet, and he healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So then the crowd was astonished when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat, and I do not want to send them away hungry lest they give out on the way.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the disciples said to him, “Where in this desolate place ˻can we get˼ so much bread that such a great crowd could be satisfied?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven, and a few little fish.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And commanding the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>he took the seven loaves and the fish and after he had given thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Now those who ate were four thousand men, in addition to women and children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And after he sent away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
