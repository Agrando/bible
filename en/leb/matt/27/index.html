You see to it!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And throwing the silver coins into the temple he departed. And he went away and hanged himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But the chief priests took the silver coins and said, “It is not permitted to put them into the temple treasury, because it is ˻blood money˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And after taking counsel, they purchased ˻with˼ them the Potter’s Field, for a burial place for strangers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>(For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood until today.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, who said, “And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one who had been priced, on whom a price had been set by the sons of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and they gave them for the potter’s field, just as the Lord directed me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And Jesus said, “You say so.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ˻when he was being accused˼ by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he did not reply to him, not even with reference to one statement, so that the governor was very astonished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now at each feast, the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd—the one whom they wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And at that time they had a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you—Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying, “˻Have nothing to do with that righteous man˼, for I have suffered much as a result of a dream today because of him.”)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas and put Jesus to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the governor answered and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Pilate said to them, “What then should I do with Jesus, the one who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he said, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they began to shout even louder, saying, “Let him be crucified!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Pilate, when he saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but instead an uproar was developing, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You see to it!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the people answered and said, “His blood be on us and on our children!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then he released Barabbas for them, but after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over so that he could be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they stripped him and put a scarlet military cloak around him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling down before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they spat on him and took the reed and repeatedly struck him on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the military cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away in order to crucify him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene ˻named˼ Simon. They forced this man to carry his cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which ˻means Place of a Skull˼),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink, and when he tasted it he did not want to drink it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they sat down and were watching over him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they put above his head the charge against him ˻in writing˼: “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and saying, “The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>“He saved others; he is not able to save himself! He is the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>He trusts in God; let him deliver him now if he wants to, because he said, ‘I am the Son of God’!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And in the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him were reviling him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Now from the sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” (that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said, “This man is summoning Elijah!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But the others said, “Leave him alone! let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook and the rocks were split.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>Now the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that took place, were extremely frightened, saying, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now when it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who also was a disciple of Jesus himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Now on the next day, which is after the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>saying, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him and tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you know how.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>So they went with the guard of soldiers and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
