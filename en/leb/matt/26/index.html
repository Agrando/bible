For she has done a good deed for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For when this woman poured this ointment on my body, she did it in order to prepare me for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and said, “What are you willing to give me if I in turn deliver him to you?” So they set out for him thirty silver coins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And from that time on, he began seeking a favorable opportunity in order that he could betray him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I am celebrating the Passover with you with my disciples.” ’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when it was evening, he was reclining at table with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And while they were eating he said, “Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And greatly distressed, each one began to say to him, “˻Surely I am not he, am I˼, Lord?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he answered and said, “The one who dips his hand in the bowl with me—this one will betray me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Judas, the one who was betraying him, answered and said, “˻Surely I am not he, am I˼, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You have said it.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now while they were eating Jesus took bread and, after giving thanks, he broke it, and giving it to the disciples, he said, “Take, eat, this is my body.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And after taking the cup and giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But I tell you, from now on I will never drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And after they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me during this night, for it is written,‘I will strike the shepherdand the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But Peter answered and said to him, “If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that during this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Peter said to him, “Even if it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be distressed and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And going forward a little he fell down on his face, praying and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, were you not able to stay awake with me one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Again for the second time he went away and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will must be done.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And he came again and found them sleeping, ˻for they could not keep their eyes open˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas—one of the twelve—arrived, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “The one whom I kiss—he is the one. Arrest him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And he came up to Jesus immediately and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And Jesus said to him, “Friend, do that for which you have come.” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And behold, one of those with Jesus extended his hand and drew his sword, and striking the slave of the high priest, cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>Or do you think that I cannot call upon my Father, and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>At that time Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me? Every day in the temple courts I sat teaching, and you did not arrest me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then the disciples all abandoned him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Now those who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and was sitting with the officers to see the outcome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order that they could put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And they did not find it, although many false witnesses came forward. And finally two came forward</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it within three days.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And the high priest stood up and said to him, “Do you reply nothing? What are these people testifying against you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath by the living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>Jesus said to him, “You have said it. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have just now heard the blasphemy!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>What do you think?” And they answered and said, “˻He deserves death˼!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists, and they slapped him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who is it who hit you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a female slave came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied it in the presence of them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And when he went out to the gateway, another female slave saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="73">73</a>And after a little while those who were standing there came up and said to Peter, “You really are one of them also, because even your accent ˻reveals who you are˼.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="74">74</a>Then he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="75">75</a>And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times,” and he went outside and wept bitterly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
