It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! It is better for you to enter into life one-eyed than, having two eyes, to be thrown into fiery hell!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>“See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that their angels in heaven constantly see the face of my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What do you think? If ˻a certain man has˼ a hundred sheep, and one of them wanders away, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go and look for the one that wandered away?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that did not wander away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the same way it is not the will ˻of˼ your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>“Now if your brother sins against you, go correct him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if he does not listen, take with you in addition one or two others, so that by ˻the testimony˼ of two or three witnesses every matter may be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses to listen to the church also, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>“Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you release on earth will be released in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Again, truly I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about any matter that they ask, it will be done for them from my Father who is in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For where two or three are gathered in my name, I am there in the midst of them.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Peter came up and said to him, “Lord, how many times will my brother sin against me and I will forgive him? Up to seven times?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>“For this reason the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man—a king—who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when he began to settle them, someone was brought to him who owed ten thousand talents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And because he did not have enough to repay it, the master ordered him to be sold, and his wife and his children and everything that he had, and to be repaid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then the slave threw himself to the ground and began to do obeisance to him, saying, ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay back everything to you!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So the master of that slave, because he had compassion, released him and forgave him the loan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and taking hold of him, he began to choke him, saying, ‘Pay back everything that you owe!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then his fellow slave threw himself to the ground and began to implore him, saying, ‘Be patient with me and I will repay you!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But he did not want to, but rather he went and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were extremely distressed, and went and reported to their master everything that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then his master summoned him and said to him, ‘Wicked slave! I forgave you all that debt because you implored me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Should you not also have shown mercy to your fellow slave as I also showed mercy to you?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And because he was angry, his master handed him over to the merciless jailers until he would repay everything that was owed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So also my heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from your hearts!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
