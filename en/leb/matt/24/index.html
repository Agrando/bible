Truly I say to you, not one stone will be left here on another stone that will not be thrown down!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And as he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came up to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, “Watch out that no one deceives you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will deceive many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And you are going to hear about wars and rumors of wars. See to it that you are not alarmed, for this must happen, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For nation will rise up against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But all these thingsare the beginning of birth pains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>“Then they will hand you over to persecution and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And then many will be led into sin and will betray one another and will hate one another,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and many false prophets will appear and will deceive many,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and because lawlessness will increase, the love of many will grow cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the one who endures to the end—this person will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>“So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken about by the prophet Daniel standing in the holy place” (let the one who reads understand),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“then those in Judea must flee to the mountains!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The one who is on his housetop must not come down to take things out of his house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the one who is in the field must not turn back to pick up his cloak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And woe to those ˻who are pregnant˼ and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But pray that your flight may not happen in winter or on a Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For at that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now, nor ever will happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And unless those days had been shortened, ˻no human being would be saved˼. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be shortened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>“At that time if anyone should say to you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or ‘Here he is,’ do not believe him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For false messiahs and false prophets will appear, and will produce great signs and wonders in order to deceive, if possible, even the elect.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Behold, I have told you ahead of time!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore if they say to you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out, or ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>“And immediately after the tribulation of those days,‘the sun will be darkenedand the moon will not give its light,and the stars will fall from heaven,and the powers of heaven will be shaken.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man arriving on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect together from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other end of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>“Now learn the parable from the fig tree: Whenever its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So also you, when you see all these things, know that he is near, at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Truly I say to you that this generation will never pass away until all these things take place!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>“But concerning that day and hour no one knows—not even the angels of heaven nor the Son—except the Father alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For just as the days of Noah were, so the coming of the Son of Man will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered into the ark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And they did not know anything until the deluge came and swept them all away. So also the coming of the Son of Man will be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then there will be two men in the field; one will be taken and one left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Therefore be on the alert, because you do not know what day your Lord is coming!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But understand this: that if the master of the house had known what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For this reason you also must be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour that you do not think he will come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>“Who then is the faithful and wise slave whom the master has put in charge of his household slaves to give them their food at the right time?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Blessed is that slave whom his master will find so doing when he comes back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge of all his possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>But if that evil slave should say ˻to himself˼, ‘My master is staying away for a long time,’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with drunkards,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>and will cut him in two and assign his place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
