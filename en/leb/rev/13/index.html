And the whole earth was astonished and followed after the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who is able to make war with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a mouth was given to him speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority to act was given to him for forty-two months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he opened his mouth for blasphemies toward God, to blaspheme his name and his dwelling, those who live in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And it was given to him to make war with the saints and to conquer them.
