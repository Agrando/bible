But if you do not, I am coming to you, and I will remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But you do have this: that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, things which I also hate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will grant to him to eat from the tree of life which is in the paradise of God.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>“And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write:“This is what the first and the last says, who was dead and came to life:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>‘I know your affliction and poverty (but you are rich), and the slander of those ˻who call themselves Jews˼ and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Do not be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and you will experience affliction ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will never be harmed by the second death.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write:“This is what the one who has the sharp double-edged sword says:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>‘I know where you live, where the throne of Satan is. And you hold fast to my name and did not deny your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I have a few things against you: that you have there those who hold fast to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat food sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So likewise you also have those who hold fast to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore repent! But if you do not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword from my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give to him some of the hidden manna, and I will give to him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, that no one knows except the one who receives it.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>“And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write:“This is what the Son of God says, the one who has his eyes like a fiery flame and his feet like fine bronze:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>‘I know your works, and your love, and faith, and service, and patient endurance—and your last works are greater than the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I have against you that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, the one who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and deceives my slaves to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I have given her time in order to repent, and she did not want to repent from her sexual immorality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold, I am throwing her into a sickbed and those who committed adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent from her deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will kill her children with deadly disease, and all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But I say to you, to the rest who are in Thyatira, all those who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say, I do not put upon you any other burden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nevertheless, hold fast to what you have until I come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, I will give him authority over the nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and “he will shepherd them with an iron rod; he will break them in pieces like jars made of clay,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>as I also have received from my Father, and I will give him the morning star.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
