I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast that has the seven heads and the ten horns that carries her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is going to come up from the abyss, and he is going to destruction. And those who live on the earth, whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will be astonished when they see the beast that was, and is not, and will be present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Here is the mind that has wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains ˻on which the woman sits˼ and they are seven kings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and whenever he comes it is necessary for him to remain a short time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the beast that was, and is not, is also himself an eighth, and is of the seven, and he is going to destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom, but they will receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These have one opinion, and they will give their power and authority to the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to me, “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and crowds and nations and languages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the ten horns that you saw and the beast, these will hate the prostitute and will make her desolate and naked, and they will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For God put into their hearts to carry out his purpose and to make ˻a unanimous decision˼ and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the woman that you saw is the great city that has sovereignty over the kings of the earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
