Hallelujah!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And a voice came out from the throne, saying,“Praise our Godall his slaves,and those who fear him,the small and the great!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I heard something like the sound of a great crowd and something like the sound of many waters and something like the sound of powerful thunder, saying,“Hallelujah!For the Lord our God the All-Powerful reigns!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Let us rejoice and be gladand give him the glory,because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come,and his bride has prepared herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it has been granted to her that she be dressed in bright, clean fine linen (for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to me, “Write: Blessed are those who are invited to the banquet of the wedding celebration of the Lamb!” And he said to me, “These are the true words of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And I fell down before his feet to worship him, and he said to me, “˻Do not do that!˼ I am a fellow slave of you and of your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and the one seated on it was called “Faithful” and “True,” and with justice he judges and makes war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now his eyes were like a flame of fire, and on his head were many royal headbands having a name written that no one except he himself knows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he was dressed in an outer garment dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the armies that are in heaven, dressed in clean, white fine linen, were following him on white horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And out of his mouth came a sharp sword, so that with it he could strike the nations. And he will shepherd them with an iron rod, and he stomps the winepress of the wine of the furious wrath of God, the All-Powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he has a name written on his outer garment and on his thigh: “King of kings and Lord of lords.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I saw one angel standing in the sun, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly ˻directly overhead˼,“Come! Assemble for the great banquet of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>in order that you may eat the flesh of kings,and the flesh of military tribunes,and the flesh of the powerful,and the flesh of horses and those seated on them,and the flesh of all people,both free and slave,and small and great!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war with the one who is seated on the horse and with his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the beast was seized, and with him the false prophet who performed the signs before him, by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who had worshiped his image. The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulphur.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the rest were killed by the sword of the one who is seated on the horse—the sword that comes out of his mouth—and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
