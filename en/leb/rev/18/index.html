these things I saw another angel descending from heaven, who had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he cried out with a powerful voice, saying,“Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great,and it has become a dwelling place of demonsand a haunt of every unclean spiritand a haunt of every unclean birdand a haunt of every unclean and detested animal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For all the nations have drunkfrom the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality,and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her,and the merchants of the earth have become richfrom the power of her sensuality.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I heard another voice from heaven saying,“Come out from her, my people,so that you will not participate in her sins,and so that you will not receive her plagues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>because her sins have reached up to heaven,and God has remembered her crimes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Pay back to her as she herself also paid out,and ˻pay back double˼ according to her deeds;in the cup that she mixed, mix double for her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As much as she glorified herself and lived in luxury,give to her so much torment and mourning,because in her heart she said,‘I sit as a queen, and am not a widow,and I will never see mourning!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Because of this her plagues will come in one day—death and mourning and famine—and she will be burned up with fire,because the Lord God who passes judgment on her is powerful!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the kings of the earth will weep and mourn over her, those who committed sexual immorality and lived sensually with her, when they see the smoke of her burning,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>standing ˻far off˼ because of the fear of her torment, saying,“Woe, woe, the great city,Babylon the powerful city,because in one hour your judgment has come!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo any more—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>cargo of gold and silver and precious stones and pearls and fine linen and purple cloth and silk and scarlet cloth and all kinds of scented wood and all kinds of ivory goods and all kinds of goods of precious wood and bronze and iron and marble</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and cinnamon and amomum and incense and ointment and frankincense and wine and olive oil and fine wheat flour and wheat and domesticated animals and sheep and horses and carriages and ˻slaves˼ and human lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>“And ˻the fruit your soul desires˼ has departed from you,and all the luxury and the splendor has perished from you,and they will never find them any more.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The merchants of these things, who became rich from them, will stand ˻far off˼, weeping and mourning because of the fear of her torment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying,“Woe, woe, the great city,dressed in fine linen and purple cloth and scarlet cloth,and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste!”And every shipmaster and ˻every seafarer˼ and sailors and all those who labor on the sea stood ˻far off˼</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and began to cry out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, “Who is like the great city?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and mourning, saying,“Woe, woe, the great city,in which all those who had ships on the seabecame rich from her prosperity,because in one hour she has been laid waste!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Rejoice over her, heavenand the saints and the apostles and the prophets,because God has pronounced your judgment on her!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And one powerful angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying,“In this way Babylon the great city will be thrown down with violence,and will never be found again!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the sound of harpists and muscians and flute players and trumpeterswill never be heard in you again!And every craftsman of every tradewill never be found in you again!And the sound of a millwill never be heard in you again!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the light of a lampwill never shine in you again!And the sound of a bridegroom and bridewill never be heard in you again!For your merchants were the most important people of the earth,because with your sorcery they deceived all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And in her was found the blood of prophets and saintsand all those who had been slaughtered on the earth.</span>
