After these things it is necessary for him to be released for a short time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And I saw thrones, and they sat down on them, and authority to judge was granted to them. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God, and who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and did not receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand, and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>(The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed.) This is the first resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection. Over this person the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for the thousand years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and he will go out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to assemble them for battle, ˻whose number˼is like the sand of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And they went up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the fortified camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulphur, where the beast and the false prophet also are, and they will be tormented day and night ˻forever and ever˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I saw a great white throne and the one who was seated on it, ˻from whose presence˼ earth and heaven fled, and a place was not found for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I saw the dead—the great and the small—standing before the throne, and books were opened.
