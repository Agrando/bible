Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Command those who are rich in this present age not to be proud and not to put their hope in the uncertainty of riches, but in God, who provides us all things richly for enjoyment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, sharing freely,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, in order that they may take hold of what is truly life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Turn away from pointless empty talk and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>which some, by professing it, have deviated concerning the faith. Grace be with you all.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
