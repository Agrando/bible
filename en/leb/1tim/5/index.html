Keep yourself pure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>(No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach and your frequent illnesses.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The sins of some people are evident, preceding them to judgment, but for some also they follow after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise also good works are evident, and those considered otherwise are not able to be hidden.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
