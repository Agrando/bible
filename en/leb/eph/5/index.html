Live like children of light</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>trying to learn what is well-pleasing to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even expose them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For it is shameful even to speak about the things being done by them in secret,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>but all things exposed by the light are made visible,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>for everything made visible is light. Therefore it says,Wake up, sleeper,and rise from the dead,and Christ will shine on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore, consider carefully how you live, not as unwise but as wise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>making the most of the time because the days are evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of this do not become foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And do not be drunk with wine (in which is dissipation), but be filled by the Spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and singing praise in your heart to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to the God and Father,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>being subject to one another ˻out of reverence for˼ Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>—wives to their own husbands as to the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>because the husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ is the head of the church (he himself being the Savior of the body).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But as the church is subject to Christ, thus also wives should be subject to their husbands in everything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for her;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in order that he might sanctify her by cleansing her with the washing of water by the word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>in order that he might present to himself the church glorious, not having a spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she may be holy and blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Thus also husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. The one who loves his own wife loves himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also Christ does the church,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because we are members of his body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>“For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>(This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Only you also, each one of you, must thus love his own wife as himself, and the wife ˻must respect˼ her husband.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
