Surely it was not all who went out from Egypt through Moses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And to whom did he swear they would not enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And so we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
