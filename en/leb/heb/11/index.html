For before his removal, he had been approved ˻as having been pleasing˼ to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and is a rewarder of those who seek him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>By faith Noah, having been warned about things not yet seen, out of reverence constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family, by which he pronounced sentence on the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out to a place that he was going to receive for an inheritance, and he went out, not knowing where he was going.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By faith he lived in the land of promise as a stranger, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the fellow heirs of the same promise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he was expecting the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>By faith, even though Sarah herself was barren, he received ˻the ability to procreate˼ even ˻past the normal age˼, because he regarded the one who had promised to be faithful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And therefore these were fathered from one man, and he being as good as dead, as the stars of heaven in number and like the innumerable sand by the shore of the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These all died in faith without receiving the promises, but seeing them from a distance and welcoming them, and admitting that they were strangers and temporary residents on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For those who say such things make clear that they are seeking a homeland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And if they had been remembering that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But now they aspire to a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac, and the one who received the promises was ready to offer his one and only son,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>with reference to whom it was said, “In Isaac your descendants will be named,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>having reasoned that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which he received him back also as a symbol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things that were going to happen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>By faith Joseph, as he was dying, mentioned about the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his bones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw the child was handsome, and they were not afraid of the edict of the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>choosing instead to be mistreated with the people of God rather than to experience the transitory enjoyment of sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>considering ˻reproach endured for the sake of Christ˼ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the anger of the king, for he persevered as if he saw the invisible one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, in order that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>By faith they crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land; the Egyptians, ˻when they made the attempt˼, were drowned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been marched around for seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she welcomed the spies in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel and the prophets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>who through faith conquered kingdoms, accomplished justice, obtained what was promised, shut the mouths of lions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>extinguished the effectiveness of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong from weakness, became mighty in battle, put to flight enemy battle lines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Women received back their dead by resurrection. But others were tortured, not accepting release, in order that they might gain a better resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And others ˻experienced mocking and flogging˼, and in addition bonds and imprisonment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They were stoned, they were sawed in two, they died by murder with a sword, they wandered about in sheepskins, in goatskins, impoverished, afflicted, mistreated,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>of whom the world was not worthy, wandering about on deserts and mountains and in caves and in holes in the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And all these, although they were approved through their faith, did not receive what was promised,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>because God had provided something better for us, so that they would not be made perfect without us.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
