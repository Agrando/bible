Through the greater and more perfect tent not made by hands, that is, not of this creation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered once for all into the most holy place, obtaining eternal redemption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled sanctify them for the ritual purity of the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works to serve the living God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And because of this, he is the mediator of a new covenant, in order that, because a death has taken place for the redemption of transgressions committed during the first covenant, those who are the called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For where there is a will, it is a necessity for the death of the one who made the will to be established.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For a will is in force concerning those who are dead, since it is never in force when the one who made the will is alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore not even the first covenant was ratified without blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>saying,“This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the utensils of service with the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Indeed, nearly everything is purified with blood according to the law, and apart from the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Christ did not enter into a sanctuary made by hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and not in order that he can offer himself many times, as the high priest enters into the sanctuary ˻year by year˼ with blood not his own,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>since it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times from the foundation of the world, but now he has appeared once at the end of the ages for the removal of sin by the sacrifice of himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And ˻just as˼ it is destined for people to die once, and after this, judgment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>thus also Christ, having been offered once in order to bear the sins of many, will appear for the second time without reference to sin to those who eagerly await him for salvation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
