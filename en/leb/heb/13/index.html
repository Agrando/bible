For he himself has said, “I will never desert you, and I will never abandon you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So then, we can say with confidence,“The Lord is my helper, and I will not be afraid.What will man do to me?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you; ˻considering the outcome of their way of life˼, imitate their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and ˻forever˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Do not be carried away by various and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods by which those who participate have not benefited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We have an altar from which those who serve in the tabernacle do not have the right to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sins are burned up outside the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore Jesus also suffered outside the gate, in order that he might sanctify the people by his own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So we must go out to him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For here we do not have a permanent city, but we seek the city that is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore through him let us offer up a sacrifice of praise ˻continually˼ to God, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And do not neglect doing good and generosity, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account, so that they can do this with joy and not with groaning, for this would be unprofitable for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Pray for us, for we are convinced that we have a good conscience, and want to conduct ourselves commendably in every way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I especially urge you to do this, so that I may be restored to you more quickly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>equip you with every good thing to do his will, carrying out in us what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory ˻forever and ever˼.
