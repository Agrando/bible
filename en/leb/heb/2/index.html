But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but we see Jesus, for a short time made lower than the angels, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God he might taste death on behalf of everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For it was fitting for him for whom are all things and through whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory to perfect the originator of their salvation through sufferings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For both the one who sanctifies and the ones who are sanctified are all from one, for which reason he is not ashamed to call them brothers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>saying,“I will proclaim your name to my brothers;in the midst of the assembly I will sing in praise of you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And again,“I will trust in him.”And again,“Behold, I and the children God has given me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, since the children share in blood and flesh, he also in like manner shared in these same things, in order that through death he could destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and could set free these who through fear of death were subject to slavery throughout all their lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For surely he is not concerned with angels, but he is concerned with the descendants of Abraham.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore he was obligated to be made like his brothers in all respects, in order that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in the things relating to God, in order to make atonement for the sins of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in that which he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
