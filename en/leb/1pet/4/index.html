Therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for your prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Above all, keep your love for one another constant, because love covers a large number of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Be hospitable to one another without complaining.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Just as each one has received a gift, use it for serving one another, as good stewards of the varied grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If anyone speaks, let it be as the oracles of God; if anyone serves, let it be as by the strength that God provides, so that in all things God will be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power ˻forever and ever˼. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Dear friends, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, when it takes place to test you, as ifsomething strange were happening to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But to the degree that you share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, so that also at the revelation of his glory you may rejoice and be glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If you are reviled on account of the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>By all means do not let anyone of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if someone suffers as a Christian, he must not be ashamed, but must glorify God with this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is the time for the judgment to begin out from the household of God. But if it begins out from us first, what will be the outcome for those who are disobedient to the gospel of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And if the righteous are saved with difficulty, ˻what will become of the ungodly and the sinner˼?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then also those who suffer according to the will of God must entrust their souls to a faithful Creator in doing good.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
