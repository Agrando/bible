And do not be afraid of their intimidation or be disturbed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>but set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense to anyone who asks you for an accounting concerning the hope that is in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But do so with courtesy and respect, having a good conscience, so that in the things in which you are slandered, the ones who malign your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For it is better to suffer for doing good, ˻if God wills it˼, than for doing evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For Christ also suffered once for sins,the just for the unjust,in order that he could bring you to God,being put to death in the flesh,but made alive in the spirit,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>in which also he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>who were formerly disobedient, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, while an ark was being constructed, in which a few—that is, eight souls—were rescued through water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And also, corresponding to this, baptism now saves you, not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, with angels and authorities and powers having been subjected to him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
