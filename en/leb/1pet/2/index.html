But if you endure when you do good and suffer for it, this finds favor with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his footsteps,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>who did not commit sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>who when he was reviled, did not revile in return; when suffering, he did not threaten, but entrusted himself to the one who judges justly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we may die to sins and live to righteousness, by whose wounds you were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you were going astray like sheep, but you have turned back now to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
