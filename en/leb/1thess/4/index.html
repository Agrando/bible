But we urge you, brothers, to progress even more,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and to aspire to live a quiet life, and to attend to ˻your own business˼, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that you may live decently toward those outside, and may have need of nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, so that you will not grieve as also the rest, who have no hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, thus also God will bring those who have fallen asleep through Jesus together with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain until the Lord’s coming, will not possibly precede those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then we who are alive, who remain, will be snatched away at the same time together with them in the clouds for a meeting with the Lord in the air, and thus we will be together with the Lord always.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore comfort one another with these words.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
