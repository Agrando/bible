We are not of the night nor of darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So then, we must not sleep like the rest, but must be on the alert and be self-controlled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But because we are of the day, we must be sober, by putting on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>because God did not appoint us for wrath, but for the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we will live at the same time with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore encourage one another and build up ˻each other˼, just as indeed you are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and rule over you in the Lord and admonish you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and to esteem them beyond all measure in love, because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we urge you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, console the discouraged, help the sick, be patient toward all people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>See to it that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue good, both toward one another and toward all people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Rejoice always,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>pray constantly,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>give thanks in everything; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Do not quench the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not despise prophecies,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but examine all things; hold fast to what is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Abstain from every form of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your spirit and soul and body be kept complete, blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The one who calls you is faithful, who also will do this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Brothers, pray for us also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>I adjure you by the Lord, have this letter read aloud to all the brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
