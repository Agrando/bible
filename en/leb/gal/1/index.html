Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I am astonished that you are turning away so quickly from the one who called you by the grace of Christ to a different gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>not that there is a different gospel, except there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim a gospel to you contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let him be accursed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As we said before, and now I say again, if anyone is proclaiming a gospel to you contrary to what you have received, let him be accursed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For am I now making an appeal to people or to God? Or am I seeking to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I make known to you, brothers, the gospel that has been proclaimed by me, that it is not ˻of human origin˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you have heard about my former way of life in Judaism, that to an extraordinary degree I was persecuting the church of God, and trying to destroy it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and was progressing in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my nation, because I was a far more zealous adherent of the traditions handed down by my forefathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to reveal his Son in me, in order that I would proclaim the gospel about him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not consult with flesh and blood,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and I returned again to Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but I did not see any others of the apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>(Now the things which I am writing to you, behold, I assure you before God that I am not lying.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>but I was unknown ˻in person˼ to the churches of Judea that are in Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and they were only hearing, “The one formerly persecuting us is now proclaiming the faith that formerly he was attempting to destroy,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and they were glorifying God because of me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
