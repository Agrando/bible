Stand firm, therefore, and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Look! I, Paul, tell you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And again I testify to every man who becomes circumcised, that he is under obligation to keep the whole law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>You are estranged from Christ, you who are attempting to be justified by the law; you have fallen from grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For through the Spirit by faith we eagerly await the hope of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but faith working through love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This persuasion is not from the one who calls you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>A little leaven leavens the whole batch of dough.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I have confidence in you in the Lord that you will think nothing different, but the one who is confusing you ˻will pay the penalty˼, whoever he may be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the stumbling block of the cross has been abolished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I wish that the ones who are disturbing you would also ˻castrate themselves˼!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not let your freedom become an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For the whole law is fulfilled in one statement, namely, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I say, live by the Spirit, and you will never carry out the desire of the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh, for these are in opposition to one another, so that whatever you want, you may not do these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are sexual immorality, impurity, licentiousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, factions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, things which I am telling you in advance, just as I said before, that the ones who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>gentleness, self control. Against such things there is no law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now those ˻who belong to Christ Jesus˼ have crucified the flesh together with its feelings and its desires.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>If we live by the Spirit, we must also follow the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>We must not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
