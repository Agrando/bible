May it never be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For if I build up again these things which I destroyed, I show myself to be a transgressor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For through the law I died to the law, in order that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me, and that life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I do not declare invalid the grace of God, for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died to no purpose.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
