(Father!),”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>so that you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, also an heir through God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But at that time when you did not know God, you were enslaved to the things which by nature are not gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But now, because you have come to know God, or rather have come to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental spirits? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You carefully observe days and months and seasons and years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I am afraid for you, lest perhaps I have labored for you in vain!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I ask you, brothers, become like me, because I also have become like you. You have done me no wrong!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But you know that because of an illness of the flesh I proclaimed the gospel to you the first time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you did not despise or disdain what was a trial for you in my flesh, but you welcomed me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So where is your blessing? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So then, have I become your enemy by being truthful to you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They zealously seek you, not commendably, but they want to exclude you, in order that you may seek them zealously.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But it is good to be sought zealously in good at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My children, for whom I am having birth pains again, until Christ is formed in you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone because I am perplexed about you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Tell me, you who are wanting to be under the law, do you not understand the law?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the female slave and one by the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the one by the female slave was born according to human descent, and the one by the free woman through the promise,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>which things are spoken allegorically, for these women are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery, who is Hagar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is a slave with her children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it is written,“Rejoice, O barren woman, who does not give birth to children;burst out and shout, you who do not have birth pains,because many are the children of the desolate woman,even more than those of the one who has a husband.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But you, brothers, are children of the promise, just as Isaac.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But just as at that time the child born according to human descent persecuted the child born according to the Spirit, so also now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But what does the scripture say? “Drive out the female slave and her son, for the son of the female slave will never inherit with the son” of the free woman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, brothers, we are not children of the female slave but of the free woman.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
