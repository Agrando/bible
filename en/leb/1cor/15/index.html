you are still in your sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And as a further result, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If ˻we have put our hope˼ in Christ in this life only, we are of all people most pitiable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since through a man came death, also through a man came the resurrection of the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But each in his own group: Christ the first fruits, then those who are Christ’s at his coming,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then the end, when he hands over the kingdom to the God and Father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For it is necessary for him to reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The last enemy to be abolished is death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For “he subjected all things under his feet.” But when it says “all things” are subjected, it is clear that the one who subjected all things to him is not included.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But whenever all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself also will be subjected to the one who subjected all things to him, in order that God may be all in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Otherwise, why do they do it, those who are being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why indeed are they being baptized on behalf of them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And why are we in danger every hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>I die every day—yes indeed, by my boasting in you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>If according to a human perspective I fought wild beasts at Ephesus, what benefit is it to me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Do not be deceived! “Bad company corrupts good morals.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Sober up correctly and ˻stop sinning˼, for some have no knowledge of God—I say this to your shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what you sow is not the body which it will become, but you sow the bare seed, whether perhaps of wheat or of some of the rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But God gives to it a body just as he wishes, and to each one of the seeds its own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Not all flesh is the same, but there is one flesh of human beings, and another flesh of animals, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the glory of the heavenly bodiesis of one kind, and the glory of the earthly bodiesis of another kind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Thus also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Thus also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>But the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>The first man is from the earth, made of earth; the second man is from heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As the one who is made of earth, so also are those who are made of earth, and as the heavenly, so also are those who are heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And just as we have borne the image of the one who is made of earth, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood is not able to inherit the kingdom of God, nor can corruption inherit incorruptibility.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Behold, I tell you a mystery: we will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>For it is necessary for this perishable body to put on incorruptibility, and this mortal body to put on immortality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>But whenever this perishable body puts on incorruptibility and this mortal body puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will take place:“Death is swallowed up in victory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Where, O death, is your victory?Where, O death, is your sting?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>Now the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>So then, my dear brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
