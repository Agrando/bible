But if it is shameful for a woman to have her head shorn or shaved, let her cover her head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For indeed a man ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, but the woman is the glory of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For man is not from woman, but woman from man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because of this, the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, on account of the angels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless, neither is woman anything apart from man, nor is man anything apart from woman in the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For just as the woman is from the man, thus also the man is through the woman. But all thingsare from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You judge ˻for yourselves˼: is it fitting for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And does not nature itself teach you that a man, if he wears long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But a woman, if she wears long hair, it is her glory, because her hair is given to her for a covering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if anyone is disposed to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor do the churches of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But in giving this instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For indeed it is necessary that there be factions among you, in order that those who are approved may become evident among you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore, when you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For when you eat it, each one of you goes ahead to take his own supper, and one is hungry and another is drunk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For do you not have houses for eating and drinking? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who do not have anything? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I will not praise you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>and after he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Likewise also the cup, after they had eaten, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But let a person examine himself, and in this way let him eat from the bread and let him drink from the cup.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the one who eats and drinks, if he does not recognize the body, eats and drinks judgment against himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Because of this, many are weak and sick among you, and quite a few ˻have died˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we were evaluating ourselves, we would not be judged.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined, in order that we will not be condemned with the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So then, my brothers, when you come together in order to eat the Lord’s supper, wait for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And I will give directions about the remaining matters whenever I come.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
