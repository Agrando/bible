For they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But God was not pleased with the majority of them, for they were struck down in the desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we should not be desirers of evil things, just as those also desired them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and not become idolaters, as some of them did, just as it is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>nor commit sexual immorality, as some of them committed sexual immorality, and twenty-three thousand fell in one day,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>nor put Christ to the test, as some of them tested him, and were destroyed by snakes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>nor grumble, just as some of them grumbled, and were destroyed by the destroyer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now these things happened to those people as an example, but are written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the ages have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore, the one who thinks that he stands must watch out lest he fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Temptation has not come upon you except what is common to humanity. But God is faithful, who will not permit you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but will also make a way out together with the temptation, so that you may be able to endure it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, my dear friends, flee from idolatry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I am speaking as to sensible people; you judge what I am saying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share from the one bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Consider Israel according to the flesh: are not the ones who eat the sacrifices sharers in the altar?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, what am I saying? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No, but that the things which they sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become sharers with demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You are not able to drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You are not able to share the table of the Lord and the table of demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Or are we attempting to provoke the Lord to jealousy? We are not stronger than he is, are we?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All things are permitted, but not all things are profitable. All things are permitted, but not all things build up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Let no one seek ˻his own good˼ but the good of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Eat everything that is sold in the meat market, ˻asking no questions˼ for the sake of the conscience,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for “the earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If any of the unbelievers invites you, and you want to go, eat everything that is set before you, ˻asking no questions˼ for the sake of the conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if someone says to you, “This is offered to idols,” do not eat it, for the sake of that one who informed you and the conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now I am not speaking about your own conscience, but the conscience of the other person. For why is my freedom judged by another’s conscience?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I partake with thankfulness, why am I slandered concerning that for which I give thanks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, whether you eat or you drink or whatever you do, do all things for the glory of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>˻Give no offense˼ both to Jews and to Greeks and to the church of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>just as I also please all people in all things, not seeking my own benefit, but the benefit of the many, in order that they may be saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
