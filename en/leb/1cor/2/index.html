For if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But just as it is written,“Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,and have not entered into the heart of man,are the things which God has prepared for those who love him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man that is in him? Thus also no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, in order that we may know the things freely given to us by God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>things which we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But the natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he is not able to understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the spiritual person discerns all things, but he himself is judged by no one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>“For who has known the mind of the Lord; who has advised him?” But we have the mind of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
