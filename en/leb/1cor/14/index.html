The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, in order that the church may receive edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, how do I benefit you, unless I speak to you either with a revelation or with knowledge or with a prophecy or with a teaching?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Likewise, the inanimate things which produce a sound, whether flute or lyre, if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the lyre?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For indeed, if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And so you through the tongue, unless you produce a clear message, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>There are probably so many kinds of languages in the world, and none without meaning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a barbarian to the one who is speaking, and the one who is speaking will be a barbarian in my judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In this way also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek for the edification of the church, in order that you may abound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore the one who speaks in a tongue must pray that he may interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>˻Therefore what should I do˼? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will also sing praise with my mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For otherwise, if you praise in your spirit, how will the one who fills the place of the outsider say the “amen” at your thanksgiving, because he does not know what you are saying?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For indeed you are giving thanks well, but the other person is not edified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>I give thanks to God that I speak with tongues more than all of you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but in the church I prefer to speak five words with my mind, in order that I may instruct other people, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Brothers, do not become children in your understanding, but with respect to wickedness be as a child, and in your understanding be mature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the law it is written:“By those who speak a foreign languageand by the lips of othersI will speak to this people,and not even in this way will they obey me,”says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So then, tongues are for a sign not to those who believe, but to unbelievers, but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore, if the whole church comes together at the same time and all speak with tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the secret things of his heart become evident, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God, proclaiming, “God is truly among you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>˻Therefore what should you do˼, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. All things must be done for edification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If anyone speaks in a tongue, it must be on one occasion two or at most three, and ˻one after the other˼, and one must interpret.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But if there is no interpreter, he must be silent in the church, but let him speak to himself and to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Let two or three prophets speak, and the others evaluate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And if something is revealed to another who is seated, the first must be silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For you are all able to prophesy ˻in turn˼, in order that all may learn and all may be encouraged,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>For God is not a God of disorder but of peace.As in all the churches of the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>the women must be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but they must be in submission, just as the law also says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But if they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Or has the word of God gone out from you, or has it come to you only?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that the things which I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But if anyone ignores this, he is ignored.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>So then, my brothers, desire to prophesy, and do not prevent speaking with tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But let all things be done decently and according to proper procedure.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
