Paul was not crucified for you, was he? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I give thanks to God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>lest anyone should say that you were baptized in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>(Now I also baptized the household of Stephanus. Beyond that I do not know if I baptized anyone else.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to proclaim the gospel, not with ˻clever speech˼, lest the cross of Christ be emptied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For it is written,“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,and the intelligence of the intelligent I will confound.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Where is the wise person? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased through the foolishness of preaching to save those who believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For indeed, Jews ask for sign miracles and Greeks seek wisdom,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a cause for stumbling, but to the Gentiles foolishness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For consider your calling, brothers, that not many were wise according to human standards, not many were powerful, not many were well born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the foolish things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the wise, and the weak things of the world God chose in order that he might put to shame the strong,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and the insignificant of the world, and the despised, God chose, the things that are not, in order that he might abolish the things that are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>so that all flesh may not boast before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But from him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>so that, just as it is written, “The one who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
