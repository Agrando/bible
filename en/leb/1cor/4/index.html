But the one who judges me is the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord should come, who will both enlighten the hidden things of darkness and will reveal the counsels of hearts, and then praise will come to each one from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now I have applied these things, brothers, to myself and Apollos for your sake, in order that in us you may learn not to go beyond what is written, lest someone be inflated with pride on behalf of one person against the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For who concedes you superiority? And what do you have that you did not receive? But if indeed you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Already you are satiated! Already you are rich! Apart from us you reign as kings! And would that indeed you reigned as kings, in order that we also might reign as kings with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For, I think, God has exhibited us apostles last of all, as condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world and to angels and to people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>We are fools for the sake of Christ, but you are prudent in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are honored, but we are dishonored!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Until the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty and poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and we toil, working with our own hands. When we are reviled, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>when we are slandered, we encourage. We have become like the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things, until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am not writing these things to shame you, but admonishing you as my dear children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I fathered you through the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore I exhort you, become imitators of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Because of this, I have sent to you Timothy, who is my dear and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ Jesus, just as I teach everywhere in every church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But some have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I am coming to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will know not the talk of the ones who have become arrogant, but the power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the kingdom of God is not with talk, but with power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>What do you want? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and a spirit of gentleness?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
