But also I will rejoice,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>for I know that this will turn out to me for deliverance through your prayer and the support of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>according to my eager expectation and hope, that I will be put to shame in nothing, but with all boldness, even now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if it is to live in the flesh, this is fruitful work for me, and which I will prefer I do not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But I am hard pressed ˻between the two options˼, having the desire to depart and to be with Christ, ˻for this is very much better˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But to stay on in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And because I am convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>so that what you can be proud of may increase in Christ Jesus because of me through my return again to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Only lead your lives in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent I hear ˻your circumstances˼, that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one soul contending side by side for the faith of the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and not letting yourselves be intimidated in anything by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction to them, but of your salvation, and this from God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>because to you has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe in him, but also to suffer on behalf of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>having the same struggle which you saw in me and now hear about in me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
