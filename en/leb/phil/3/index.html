To write the same things to you is not troublesome to me, but is a safeguard for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the mutilation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and do not put confidence in the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>although I could have confidence even in the flesh.If anyone else thinks to put confidence in the flesh, I can do so more:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>˻circumcised on the eighth day˼, from the nation of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born from Hebrews, according to the law a Pharisee,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>according to zeal persecuting the church, according to the righteousness in the law being blameless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But whatever things were gain to me, these things I have considered loss because of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>˻More than that˼, I even consider all things to be loss because of the surpassing greatness of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and consider them dung, in order that I may gain Christ</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and may be found in him, not having my righteousness which is from the law, but which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God on the basis of faith,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>so that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>if somehow I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Not that I have already received this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on if indeed I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Brothers, I do not consider myself to have laid hold of it.
