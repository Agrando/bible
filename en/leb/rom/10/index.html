And how will they believe in him about whom they have not heard? And how will they hear about him without one who preaches to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And how will they preach, unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How timely are the feet of those who bring good news of good things.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Consequently, faith comes by hearing, and hearing through the word about Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I say, they have not heard, have they? On the contrary,“Their voice has gone out to all the earth,and their words to the ends of the inhabited world.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But I say, Israel did not know, did they? First, Moses says,“I will provoke you to jealousy by those who are not a nation;by a senseless nation I will provoke you to anger.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Isaiah is very bold and says,“I was found by those who did not seek me;I became known to those who did not ask for me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But about Israel he says,“The whole day long I held out my handsto a disobedient and resistant people.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
