But if her husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress if she belongs to another man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So then, my brothers, you also were brought to death with respect to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For when we were in the flesh, sinful desires were working through the law in our members, to bear fruit for death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But now we have been released from the law, because we have died to that by which we were bound, so that we may serve in newness of the Spirit and not in oldness of the letter of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then shall we say? Is the law sin? May it never be! But I would not have known sin except through the law, for I would not have known covetousness if the law had not said, “Do not covet.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin is dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I was alive once, apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and I died, and this commandment which was to lead to life was found with respect to me to lead to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, did that which is good become death to me? May it never be! Rather it was sin, in order that it might be recognized as sin, producing death through what is good for me, in order that sin might become sinful to an extraordinary degree through the commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am fleshly, ˻sold into slavery to sin˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For what I am doing I do not understand, because what I want to do, this I do not practice, but what I hate, this I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if what I do not want to do, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But now I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that good does not live in me, that is, in my flesh. For the willing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the good that I want to do, I do not do, but the evil that I do not want to do, this I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if what I do not want to do, this I am doing, I am no longer the one doing it, but sin that lives in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Consequently, I find the principle with me, the one who wants to do good, that evil is present with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my inner person,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I observe another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that exists in my members.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself with my mind am enslaved to the law of God, but with my flesh I am enslaved to the law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
