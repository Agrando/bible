For I hope while I am passing through to see you and to be sent on my way by you, whenever I have first enjoyed your company for a while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But now I am traveling to Jerusalem, serving the saints.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For they were pleased to do so, and they are obligated to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they ought also to serve them in material things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore, after I have accomplished this and sealed this fruit for delivery to them, I will depart by way of you for Spain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>and I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now I exhort you, brothers, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to contend along with me in your prayers on my behalf to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea, and my ministry in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>so that, coming to you with joy by the will of God, I may rest with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Now may the God of peace be with all of you. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
