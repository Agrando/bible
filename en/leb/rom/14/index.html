To his own master he stands or falls, and he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For one person prefers one day over another day, and another person regards every day alike. Each one must be fully convinced in his own mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The one who is intent on the day is intent on it for the Lord, and the one who eats eats for the Lord, because he is thankful to God, and the one who does not eat does not eat for the Lord, and he is thankful to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For Christ died and became alive again for this reason, in order that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But why do you judge your brother? Or also, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For it is written,“As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me,and every tongue will praise God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, let us no longer pass judgment on one another, but rather decide this: not to place a cause for stumbling or a temptation before a brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean of itself, except to the one who considers something to be unclean; to that person it is unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if because of food, your brother is grieved, you are no longer living according to love. Do not destroy by your food that person for whom Christ died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore do not let your good be slandered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the one who serves Christ in this wayis well-pleasing to God and approved by people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then, let us pursue ˻what promotes peace˼ and ˻what edifies one another˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Do not destroy the work of God on account of food. All thingsare clean, but it is wrong for the person ˻who eats and stumbles in the process˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything by which your brother stumbles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The faith that you have, have with respect to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not pass judgment on himself by what he approves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the one who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not do so from faith, and everything that is not from faith is sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
