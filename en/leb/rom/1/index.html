Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>First, I give thanks to my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is being proclaimed in the whole world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For God, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, is my witness, how constantly I make mention of you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>always asking in my prayers if somehow now at last I may succeed to come to you in the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For I desire to see you, in order that I may impart some spiritual gift to you, in order to strengthen you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>that is, to be encouraged together with you through ˻our mutual faith˼, both yours and mine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I intended to come to you, and was prevented until now, in order that I might have some fruit among you also, just as also among the rest of the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus ˻I am eager˼ to proclaim the gospel also to you who are in Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith, just as it is written, “But the one who is righteous by faith will live.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and unrighteousness of people, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because what can be known about God is evident among them, for God made it clear to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For from the creation of the world, his invisible attributes, both his eternal power and deity, are discerned clearly, being understood in the things created, so that they are without excuse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks, but they became futile in their reasoning, and their senseless hearts were darkened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Claiming to be wise, they became fools,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and exchanged the glory of the immortal God with the likeness of an image of mortal human beings and birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to immorality, that their bodies would be dishonored among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who exchanged the truth of God with a lie, and worshiped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed for eternity. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Because of this, God gave them over to degrading passions, for their females exchanged the natural relations for those contrary to nature,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and likewise also the males, abandoning the natural relations with the female, were inflamed in their desire toward one another, males with males committing the shameless deed, and receiving in themselves the penalty that was necessary for their error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And just as they did not see fit ˻to recognize God˼, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do the things that are not proper,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, greediness, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malevolence. They are gossipers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>slanderers, haters of God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, contrivers of evil, disobedient to parents,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>senseless, faithless, unfeeling, unmerciful,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>who, although they know the requirements of God, that those who do such things are worthy of death, not only do they do the same things, but also they approve of those who do them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
