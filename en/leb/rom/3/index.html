For first, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>˻What is the result˼ if some refused to believe? Their unbelief will not nullify the faithfulness of God, will it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>May it never be! But let God be true but every human being a liar, just as it is written,“In order that you may be justified in your words,and may prevail when you are judged.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? God, who inflicts wrath, is not unjust, is he? (I am speaking according to a human perspective.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>May it never be! For otherwise, how will God judge the world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But if by my lying, the truth of God abounded to his glory, why am I also still condemned as a sinner?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And why not (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say), “Let us do evil, in order that good may come of it? Their condemnation is just!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then? Do we have an advantage? Not at all. For we have already charged both Jews and Greeks are all under sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>just as it is written,“There is no one righteous, not even one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>there is no one who understands;there is no one who seeks God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>All have turned aside together; they have become worthless;There is no one who practices kindness;there is not even one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their throat is an opened grave;they deceive with their tongues;the venom of asps is under their lips,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>destruction and distress are in their paths,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they have not known the way of peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The fear of God is not before their eyes.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those under the law, in order that every mouth may be closed and the whole world may become accountable to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For by the works of the law ˻no person will be declared righteous˼ before him, for through the law comes knowledge of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, being testified about by the law and the prophets—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. For there is no distinction,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>being justified as a gift by his grace, through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>whom God made publicly available as the mercy seat through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previously committed sins,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>in the forbearance of God, for the demonstration of his righteousness in the present time, so that he should be just and the one who justifies the person by faith in Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, where is boasting? It has been excluded. By what kind of law? Of works? No, but by a law of faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For we consider a person to be justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, also of the Gentiles,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>since God is one, who will justify ˻those who are circumcised˼ by faith and ˻those who are uncircumcised˼ through faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore, do we nullify the law through faith? May it never be! But we uphold the law.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
