For we say, “Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>How then was it credited? While he was ˻circumcised˼ or ˻uncircumcised˼? Not ˻while circumcised˼ but ˻while uncircumcised˼!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness by faith which he had˻while uncircumcised˼, so that he could be the father of all who believe ˻although they are uncircumcised˼, so that righteousness could be credited to them also,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the father ˻of those who are circumcised˼ to those who are not only from the circumcision, but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham ˻which he had while uncircumcised˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants, that he would be heir of the world, was not through the law, but through the righteousness by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For if those of the law are heirs, faith is rendered void and the promise is nullified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For the law produces wrath, but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Because of this, it is by faith, in order that it may be according to grace, so that the promise may be secure to all the descendants, not only to those of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>(just as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”) before God, in whom he believed, the one who makes the dead alive and who calls the things that are not as though they are,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who against hope believed in hope, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said, “so will your descendants be.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And not being weak in faith, he considered his own body already as good as dead, because he was approximately a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah’s womb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he did not waver in unbelief at the promise of God, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and being fully convinced that what he had promised, he was also able to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, indeed, it was credited to him for righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But it was not written for the sake of him alone that it was credited to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but also for the sake of us to whom it is going to be credited, to those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who was handed over on account of our trespasses, and was raised up in the interest of our justification.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
