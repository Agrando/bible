So do you want not to be afraid of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>for it is God’s servant to you for what is good. But if you do what is bad, be afraid, because it does not bear the sword to no purpose. For it is God’s servant, the one who avenges for punishment on the one who does what is bad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are servants of God, busily engaged in this very thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Pay to everyone what is owed: pay taxes to whom taxes are due; pay customs duties to whom customs duties are due; pay respect to whom respect is due; pay honor to whom honor is due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe nothing to anyone, except to love one another, for the one who loves someone else has fulfilled the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, you shall not commit murder, you shall not steal, you shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, are summed up in this statement: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love does not commit evil against a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And do this because you know the time, that it is already the hour for you to wake up from sleep. For our salvation is nearer now than when we believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far gone, and the day has drawn near. Therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the weapons of light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Let us live decently, as in the day, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and do not make provision for the desires of the flesh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
