For in that which you pass judgment on someone else, you condemn yourself, for you who are passing judgment are doing the same things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Now we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against those who do such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But do you think this, O man who passes judgment on those who do such things, and who does the same things, that you will escape the judgment of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentence?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But because of your stubbornness and unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and of the revelation of the righteous judgment of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who will reward each one according to his works:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>to those who, by perseverance in good work, seek glory and honor and immortality, eternal life,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>but to those who act from selfish ambition and who disobey the truth, but who obey unrighteousness, wrath and anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>There will be affliction and distress for every ˻human being˼ who does evil, of the Jew first and of the Greek,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>but glory and honor and peace to everyone who does good, to the Jew first and to the Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For there is no partiality with God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous in the sight of God, but the doers of the law will be declared righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things of the law, these, although they do not have the law, are a law to themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who show the work of the law written on their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts one after another accusing or even defending them</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>on the day when God judges the secret things of people, according to my gospel, through Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and know his will and approve the things that are superior, because you are instructed by the law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those in darkness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, the one who teaches someone else, do you not teach yourself? The one who preaches not to steal, do you steal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The one who says not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? The one who abhors idols, do you rob temples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Who boast in the law, by the transgression of the law you dishonor God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For just as it is written, “The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For circumcision is of value if you do the law, but if you should be a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore, if the uncircumcised person follows the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the uncircumcised person by nature who carries out the law will judge you who, though provided with ˻the precise written code˼ and circumcision are a transgressor of the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the Jew is not ˻one outwardly˼, nor is circumcision ˻outwardly˼, in the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the Jew ˻is one inwardly˼, and circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter, whose praise is not from people but from God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
