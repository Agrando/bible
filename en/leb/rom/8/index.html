By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>in order that the requirement of the law would be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For those who are living according to the flesh are intent on the things of the flesh, but those who are living according to the Spirit are intent on the things of the Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For the mindset of the flesh is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>because the mindset of the flesh is enmity toward God, for it is not subjected to the law of God, for it is not able to do so,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this person ˻does not belong to him˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will also make alive your mortal bodies through his Spirit who lives in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So then, brothers, we are obligated not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For all those who are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry out, “Abba! Father!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The Spirit himself confirms to our spirit that we are children of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and if children, also heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer together with him so that we may also be glorified together with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I consider that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For the eagerly expecting creation awaits eagerly the revelation of the sons of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For the creation has been subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of the one who subjected it, in hope</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that the creation itself also will be set free from its servility to decay, into the glorious freedom of the children of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For we know that the whole creation groans together and suffers agony together until now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Not only this, but we ourselves also, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves while we await eagerly our adoption, the redemption of our body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For in hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, for who hopes for what he sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But if we hope for what we do not see, we await it eagerly with patient endurance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And likewise also, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how to pray as one ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for uswith unexpressed groanings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the one who searches our hearts knows what the mindset of the Spirit is, because he intercedes on behalf of the saints according to the will of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, for those who are called according to his purpose,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>because those whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be the firstborn among many brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And those whom he predestined, these he also called, and those whom he called, these he also justified, and those whom he justified, these he also glorified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will he not also, together with him, freely give us all things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Who will bring charges against God’s elect? God is the one who justifies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is the one who died, and more than that, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will affliction or distress or persecution or hunger or lack of sufficient clothing or danger or the sword?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Just as it is written,“On account of you we are being put to death the whole day long;we are considered as sheep for slaughter.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>No, but in all these things we prevail completely through the one who loved us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
