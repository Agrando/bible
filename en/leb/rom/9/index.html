Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But it is not as if the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>nor are they all children because they are descendants of Abraham, but “In Isaac will your descendants be named.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That is, it is not the children ˻by human descent˼who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the statement of the promise is this: “At this time I will return and ˻Sarah will have˼ a son.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And not only this, but also when Rebecca conceived children by one man, Isaac our father—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>for although they had not yet been born, or done anything good or evil, in order that the purpose of God according to election might remain,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>not by works but by the one who calls—it was said to her, “The older will serve the younger,”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>just as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What then shall we say? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For to Moses he says, “I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassion.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Consequently therefore, ˻it does not depend on the˼ one who wills or on the one who runs, but on God who shows mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very reason I have raised you up, so that I may demonstrate my power in you, and so that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Consequently therefore, he has mercy on whomever he wishes, and he hardens whomever he wishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore you will say to me, “Why then does he still find fault? For who has resisted his will?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On the contrary, O man, who are you who answers back to God? Will what is molded say to the one who molded it, “Why did you make me like this”?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Or does the potter not have authority over the clay, to make from the same lump a vessel that is for ˻honorable use˼ and one that is for ˻ordinary use˼?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And what if God, wanting to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he did so in order that he could make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>us whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>As he also says in Hosea,“I will call those who were not my people, ‘My people,’and those who were not loved, ‘Loved.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it will be in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’there they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,“Even if the number of the sons of Israel is like the sand of the sea,the remnant will be saved,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>˻for the Lord will execute his sentence thoroughly and decisively˼ upon the earth.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And just as Isaiah foretold,“If the Lord of hosts had not left us descendants,we would have become like Sodomand would have resembled Gomorrah.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>What then shall we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness—even the righteousness that is by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, did not attain to the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Why that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if by works. They stumbled over the ˻stone that causes people to stumble˼,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>just as it is written,“Behold, I am laying in Zion ˻a stone that causes people to stumble˼,and ˻a rock that causes them to fall˼,and the one who believes in him will not be put to shame.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
