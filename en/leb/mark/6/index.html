And what is this wisdom that has been granted to this man, and the miracles such as these performed through his hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they were offended by him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own household.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he was not able to do any miracle in that place except to lay his hands on a few sick peopleand heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he was astonished because of their unbelief.And he was going around among the villages teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he commanded them that they take along nothing for the journey except only a staff—no bread, no traveler’s bag, no money in their belts—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but to put on sandals and not to wear two tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he said to them, “Whenever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they went out and proclaimed that people should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they were expelling many demons and anointing many sick people with olive oil and healing them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And King Herod heard it, because his name had become known. And they were saying, “John, the one who baptizes, has been raised from the dead, and because of this these miraculous powers are at work in him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the prophets.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard it, he said, “John whom I beheaded—this one has been raised!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not permitted for you to have your brother’s wife.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Herodias held a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and was not able to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For Herod was afraid of John, because he knew him to be a righteous and holy man and protected him. And when he listened to him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he listened to him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And a suitable day came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers and military tribunes and the most prominent men of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and ˻his dinner guests˼. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he swore to her at length, “Anything whatever you ask me for I will give you, up to half my kingdom!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the baptizer.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And although he was deeply grieved, the king, because of his oaths and ˻dinner guests˼, did not want to refuse her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately the king sent an executioner and ordered him to bring his head. And he went and beheaded him in the prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when his disciples heard this, they came and took away his corpse and placed it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the apostles regathered to Jesus and reported to him everything that they had done and that they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said to them, “You yourselves come privately to an isolated place and rest for a short time.” For those who were coming and going were many, and they did not even have time to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they went away in the boat to an isolated place by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And many people saw them leaving and recognized them, and ran there together by land from all the towns, and arrived ahead of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And getting out of the boat he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep ˻without˼ a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the hour had already become late when his disciples came up to him, saying, “The place is desolate and the hour is already late.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding farms and villages and purchase something to eat for themselves.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But he answered and said to them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to him, “Should we go and purchase bread for two hundred denarii and give it to them to eat?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go look!” And when they found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he ordered them all to recline in groups on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they reclined in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples so that they could set them before them. And he distributed the two fish to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they all ate and were satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they picked up the broken pieces, twelve baskets full, and of the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself dismissed the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And after he had said farewell to them, he went away to the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he saw them being beaten in their rowing because the wind was against them. Around the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he was wanting to pass by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost, and they cried out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>For they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke with them and said to them, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And he went up with them into the boat, and the wind abated. And ˻they were extraordinarily˼ astounded within themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>because they did not understand concerning the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And after they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And as they were getting out of the boat, people recognized him immediately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>They ran about through that whole region and began to carry around those ˻who were sick˼ on stretchers, wherever they heard that he was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And wherever he would go, into villages or into towns or to farms, they would put those who were sick in the marketplaces and would implore him that if they could touch even the edge of his cloak. And all those who touched it were healed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
