And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now after John ˻had been taken into custody˼, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as he was passing by along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus said to them, “˻Follow˼ me and I will make you become fishers of people.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And immediately they left their nets and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, and they were in the boat mending the nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went away after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he went into the synagogue and began to teach.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And so then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, “˻Leave us alone˼, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, so that they began to discuss with one another, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the report about him then went out everywhere in the whole surrounding region of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And so then he departed from the synagogue and came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, suffering with a fever, and at once they told him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he came and raised her up by taking hold of her hand, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now when it was evening, when the sun had set, they began bringing to him all those ˻who were sick˼ and those who were demon-possessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the whole town was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he healed many ˻who were sick˼ with various diseases and expelled many demons. And he did not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And getting up early in the morning while it was very dark, he departed and went to a deserted place, and there he was praying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and those who were with him searched diligently for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And he said to them, “Let us go elsewhere, into the neighboring rural towns, so that I can preach there also, because I have come out for this very reason.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And a leper came to him, entreating him and kneeling down and saying to him, “If you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And having compassion, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, “I am willing; be made clean.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And immediately the leprosy went away from him and he was made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And warning him sternly, he sent him away at once.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And he said to him, “See to it that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread abroad the account, so that he was no longer able to enter publicly into a town. But he was staying outside in deserted places, and they were coming to him from all directions.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
