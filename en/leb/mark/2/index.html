And after digging through, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, “Why are you considering these things in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the paralytic—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>“I say to you, get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he began to teach them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up and followed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it happened that he ˻was dining˼ in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners ˻were dining with˼ Jesus and his disciples, for there were many and they were following him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, began to say to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those ˻who are sick˼. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, “˻Why˼ do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to them, “The ˻bridegroom’s attendants˼ are not able to fast while the bridegroom is with them, are they? As long a time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. ˻Otherwise˼ the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and the tear becomes worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. ˻Otherwise˼ the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine is destroyed and the wineskins too. But new wine is put into new wineskins.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to make their way while plucking off the heads of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharisees began to say to him, “Behold, why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he had need and he and those who were with him were hungry—</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>how he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests) and also gave it to those who were with him?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And he said to them, “The Sabbath was established for people, and not people for the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So then, the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
