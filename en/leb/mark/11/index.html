Untie it and bring it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord has need of it, and will send it here again at once.’ ”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And some of those who were standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So they told them, just as Jesus had said, and they allowed them to take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and he sat on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches they had cut from the fields.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who went ahead and those who were following were shouting,“Hosanna!Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he went into Jerusalem to the temple, and after looking around at everything, because the hour was already evening, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And on the next day as they were departing from Bethany, he was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when he saw from a distance a fig tree that had leaves, he went to see if perhaps he would find anything on it. And when he came up to it he found nothing except leaves, because it was not the season for figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he responded and said to it, “Let no one eat fruit from you any more ˻forever˼!” And his disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered into the temple courtsand began to drive out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple courts, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those who were selling doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he did not permit anyone to carry objects through the temple courts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he began to teach and was saying to them, “Is it not written,‘My house will be called a house of prayerfor all the nations,’but you have made it a cave of robbers!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and began considering how they could destroy him. For they were afraid of him because the whole crowd was astounded by his teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when evening came they went out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And as they passed by early in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, “Have faith in God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Truly I say to you that whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea!’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For this reason I say to you, whatever you pray and ask for, believe that you have received it, and it will be done for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your sins.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came up to him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and said to him, “By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority that you do these things?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men? Answer me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they began to discuss this with one another, saying, “If we say ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But if we say, ‘From men’ ”—they were afraid of the crowd, because they all looked upon John ˻as truly a prophet˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they replied to Jesus saying, “We do not know.” And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
