After breaking the alabaster flask, she poured it out on his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But some were expressing indignation to one another: “Why has there been this waste of perfumed oil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For this perfumed oil could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor!” And they began to scold her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why do you cause trouble for her? She has done a good deed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For the poor you always have with you, and you can do good for them whenever you want, but you do not always have me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has done what she could; ˻she has anointed my body beforehand˼ for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they heard this, they were delighted, and promised to give him money. And he began seeking how he could betray him conveniently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare, so that you can eat the Passover?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, “Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?” ’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will show you a large upstairs room furnished and ready, and prepare for us there.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the disciples went out and came into the city and found everything just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when it was evening, he arrived with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And while they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, that one of you who is eating with me will betray me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They began to be distressed and to say to him one by one, “Surely not I?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But he said to them, “It is one of the twelve—the one who is dipping bread into the bowl with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And while they were eating, he took bread and, after giving thanks, he broke it and gave it to them and said, “Take it, this is my body.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly I say to you that I will never drink of the fruit of the vine any longer until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, because it is written,‘I will strike the shepherdand the sheep will be scattered.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter said to him, “Even if they all fall away, certainly I will not!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that today—this night—before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he kept saying emphatically, “If it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And they all were saying the same thing also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they came to a place ˻named˼ Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took along Peter and James and John with him, and he began to be distressed and troubled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And going forward a little he fell to the ground and began to pray that, if it were possible, the hour would pass from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he said, “Abba, Father, all thingsare possible for you! Take away this cup from me! Yet not what I will, but what you will.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not able to stay awake one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And again he went away and prayed, saying the same thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And again he came and found them sleeping, ˻for they could not keep their eyes open˼, and they did not know what to reply to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he came the third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come. Behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas—one of the twelve—arrived, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “The one whom I kiss—he is the one. Arrest him and lead him away under guard!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he arrived, he came up to him immediately and said, “Rabbi,” and kissed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So they laid hands on him and arrested him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But a certain one of the bystanders, drawing his sword, struck the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Every day I was with you in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me! But this has happened in order that the scriptures would be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they all abandoned him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And a certain young man was following him, clothed only in a linen cloth on his naked body. And they attempted to seize him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>but he left behind the linen cloth and fled naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Peter followed him from a distance, right inside, into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the officers and warming himself by the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for testimony against Jesus in order to put him to death, and they did not find it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony was not consistent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And some stood up and began to give false testimony against him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>“We heard him saying, ‘I will destroy this temple made by hands, and within three days I will build another not made by hands.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And their testimony was not even consistent about this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And the high priest stood up in the midst of themand asked Jesus, saying, “Do you not reply anything? What are these people testifying against you?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But he was silent and did not reply anything. Again the high priest asked him and said to him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And Jesus said, “I am, and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>And the high priest tore his clothes and said, “What further need do we have of witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>You have heard the blasphemy! What ˻do you think˼?” And they all condemned him ˻as deserving death˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him with their fists, and to say to him “Prophesy!” And the officers received him with slaps in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>And while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the female slaves of the high priest came up</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean!” And he went out into the gateway, and a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And the female slave, when she saw him, began to say again to the bystanders, “This man is one of them!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>But he denied it again. And after a little while, again the bystanders began to say to Peter, “You really are one of them, because you also are a Galilean!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>And he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know this man whom you are talking about!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And immediately a rooster crowed for the second time. And Peter remembered the statement, how Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times,” and throwing himself down, he began to weep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
