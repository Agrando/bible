And he sent many others, some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He had one more, a beloved son. Last of all he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But those tenant farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they seized and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have you not read this scripture:‘The stone which the builders rejected,this has become ˻the cornerstone˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This came about from the Lord,and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they were seeking to arrest him, and they were afraid of the crowd, because they knew that he had told the parable with reference to them. And they left him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him so that they could catch him unawares in a statement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they came, they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and ˻you do not care what anyone thinks˼, ˻because you do not regard the opinion of people˼ but teach the way of God in truth. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But because he knew their hypocrisy, he said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius so that I can look at it!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they brought one. And he said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” And they said to him, “Caesar’s.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!” And they were utterly amazed at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and began to ask him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if someone’s brother dies and he leaves behind a wife and does not leave a child, that his brother should take the wife and ˻father˼ descendants for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife. And when he died, he did not leave descendants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the second took her, and he died without leaving descendants. And the third likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the seven did not leave descendants. Last of all the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>In the resurrection, when they rise, ˻whose˼ wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus said to them, “Are you not deceived because of this, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses ˻in the passage about the bush˼ how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are very much mistaken!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the scribes came up and heard them debating. When he saw that he answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the scribe said to him, “That is true, Teacher. You have said ˻correctly˼ that he is one and there is no other except him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And to love him from your whole heart and from your whole understanding and from your whole strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus, when he saw that he had answered thoughtfully, said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to put a question to him any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And continuing, Jesus said while teaching in the temple courts, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is David’s son?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>David himself said by the Holy Spirit,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,until I put your enemiesunder your feet.” ’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?” And the large crowd was listening to him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And in his teaching he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and greetings in the marketplaces</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he sat down opposite the contribution box and was observing how the crowd was putting coins into the contribution box. And many rich people were putting in many coins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And one poor widow came and put in two small copper coins (that is, a penny).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And summoning his disciples, he said to them, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all those who put offerings into the contribution box.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>For they all ˻contributed˼ out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everything she had, her whole means of subsistence.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
