You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has been raised, he is not here! See the place where they laid him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they went out and fled from the tomb, because trembling and amazement had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.〚So they promptly reported all the things they had been commanded to those around Peter. And after these things, Jesus himself also sent out through them from the east even as far as the west the holy and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. Amen.〛〚</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now early on the first day of the week, after he rose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had expelled seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went out and announced it to those who were with him while they were mourning and weeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And those, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, refused to believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And after these things, he appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking, while they were going out into the countryside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And these went and reported it to the others, and they did not believe them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And later, while they were reclining at table, he appeared to the eleven. And he reprimanded their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who refuses to believe will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will expel demons, they will speak in new tongues,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and they will pick up snakes with their hands. And if they drink any deadly poison it will never hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick and ˻they will get˼ well.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went out and proclaimed everywhere, while the Lord was working together with them and confirming the message through the accompanying signs.〛</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
