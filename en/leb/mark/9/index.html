And he was transfigured before them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and his clothing became radiant—extremely white, like no cloth refiner on earth can ˻make so white˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Elijah appeared to them together with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good that we are here! And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>(For he did not know what he should answer, because they were terrified.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And a cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus alone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And as they were coming down from the mountain, he ordered them that they should tell no one the things that they had seen, except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they kept the matter to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead ˻meant˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they asked him, saying, “˻Why do˼ the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And he said to them, “Elijah indeed does come first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I tell you that indeed Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And immediately the whole crowd, when they saw him, were amazed, and ran up to himand greeted him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And one individual from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought to you my son who has ˻a spirit that makes him mute˼.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes paralyzed. And I told your disciples that they should expel it, and they were not able to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he answered them and said, “O unbelieving generation! ˻How long˼ will I be with you? ˻How long˼ must I put up with you? Bring him to me!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, the spirit immediately convulsed him, and falling on the ground, he began to roll around, foaming at the mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he asked his father how long it was since this had been happening to him. And he said, “From childhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And often it has thrown him both into fire and into water, in order that it could destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But Jesus said to him, “If you are able! All thingsare possible for the one who believes!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe! Help my unbelief!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter into him no more!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And it came out, screaming and convulsing him greatly, and he became as if he were dead, so that most of them said, “He has died!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus took hold of his hand and raised him up, and he stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And after he had entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why were we not able to expel it?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And from there they went out and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>for he was teaching his disciples and was telling them, “The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they came to Capernaum. And after he was in the house, he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they were silent, because they had argued with one another on the way about who was greatest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he sat down and called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he took a young child and had him stand ˻among them˼. And taking him in his arms, he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>“Whoever welcomes one of the young children such as these in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me, but the one who sent me.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>John said to him, “Teacher, we saw someone expelling demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said, “Do not prevent him, because there is no one who does a miracle in my name and will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For whoever is not against us is for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in my name because you are Christ’s, truly I say to you that he will never lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>“And whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it is better for him if instead ˻a large millstone˼ is placed around his neck and he is thrown into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than, having two hands, to go into hell—into the unquenchable fire!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life lame than, having two feet, to be thrown into hell!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out! It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than, having two eyes, to be thrown into hell,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>‘where their worm does not die and the fire is not extinguished.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For everyone will be salted with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Salt is good, but if the salt becomes deprived of its salt content, by what can you make it salty? Have salt among yourselves, and be at peace with one another.”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
