And there are many other traditions which they have received and hold fast to—for example, the washing of cups and pitchers and bronze kettles and dining couches.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unclean hands?”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So he said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written,‘This people honors me with their lips,but their heart is far, far away from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they worship me in vain,teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Abandoning the commandment of God, you hold fast to the tradition of men.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them, “You splendidly ignore the commandment of God so that you can maintain your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother ˻must certainly die˼.’</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or to his mother, “Whatever ˻benefit you would have received˼ from me iscorban” (that is, a gift to God),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down, and you do many similar things such as this.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And summoning the crowd again, he said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing outside of a person that is able to defile him by going into him. But the things that go out of a person are the things that defile a person.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when he entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he said to them, “So are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything that is outside that goes into a person is not able to defile him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For it does not enter into his heart but into his stomach, and goes out into the latrine”—thus declaring all foods clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, “What comes out of a person, that defiles a person.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For from within, from the heart of people, come evil plans, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>adulteries, acts of greed, malicious deeds, deceit, licentiousness, ˻envy˼, abusive speech, pride, foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>All these evil things come from within and defile a person.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And from there he set out and went to the region of Tyre. And when he entered into a house, he wanted no one to know, and yet he was not able to escape notice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But immediately a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, when she heard about him, came and fell down at his feet,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now the woman was a Greek—a Syrophoenician by nationality—and she was asking him that he would expel the demon from her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs!”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But she answered and said to him, “Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to her, “Because of this statement, go! The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when she went to her home, she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And again he went away from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of the Decapolis.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they were imploring him that he would place his hand on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he took him away from the crowd by himself and put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (that is, “Be opened!”).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And immediately his ears were opened and ˻his difficulty in speaking was removed˼ and he began to speak normally.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he ordered them that they should say nothing, but as much as he ordered them not to, they proclaimed it even more instead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And they were amazed beyond all measure, saying, “He has done all things well! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!”</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
