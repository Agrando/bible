So I answered, O Lord Jehovah, You know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Again He said to me, Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, O dry bones, hear the Word of Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I prophesied as I was commanded. And as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a shaking; and the bones came together, bone to its bone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then He said to me, Prophesy to the spirit; prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the spirit came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then He said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, Our bones are dry, our hope is lost, and we ourselves are cut off!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore prophesy and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up out of your graves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken it and performed it, says Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover, son of man, take a stick for yourself and write on it: For Judah and for the children of Israel, his companions. Then take another stick and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel, his companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then join them one to another for yourself into one stick, and they will become one in your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when the children of your people speak to you, saying, Will you not show us what you mean by these?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel, his companions; and I will join them with it, with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they will be one in My hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the sticks on which you write will be in your hand before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from among the nations, there where they have gone, and will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king over them all; they shall no longer be two nations, nor shall they ever be divided into two kingdoms again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They shall not defile themselves anymore with their idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their transgressions; but I will deliver them out of all their dwelling places where they have sinned, and will cleanse them. Thus they shall be My people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And David My servant shall be king over them, and they shall all have one Shepherd; they shall also walk in My judgments and keep My statutes, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob My servant, where your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell there, they, their children, and their childrenÂ’s children, always; and My servant David shall be their prince forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them, and it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; I will establish them and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>My tabernacle also shall be with them; yes, I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the nations will know that I, Jehovah, sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary shall be in their midst forever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
