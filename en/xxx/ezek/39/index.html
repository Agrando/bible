I will give you to the birds of prey of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>You shall fall upon the open field; for I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I will send fire on Magog and on those who live in security in the coastlands. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus I will make My holy name known in the midst of My people Israel, and I will not let My holy name be profaned anymore. And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, it is coming, and it shall be done, declares the Lord Jehovah. This is the day of which I have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who dwell in the cities of Israel will go out and set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and bucklers, the bows and arrows, the javelins and spears; and they shall kindle fires with them for seven years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They will not take wood from the field nor cut down any from the forests, because they will kindle fires with the weapons; and they shall plunder those who plundered them, and pillage those who pillaged them, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>It will come to pass in that day that I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel, the valley of those who pass by east of the sea; and it will stop the noses of travelers, because there they will bury Gog and all his multitude. Therefore they will call it the Valley of Hamon Gog.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For seven months the house of Israel shall be burying them, in order to cleanse the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Indeed all the people of the land will be burying, and they will gain renown for it on the day that I am glorified, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they will assign men to continually pass through the land, traveling along, to bury those remaining on the face of the earth, in order to cleanse it. At the end of seven months they will make a search.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And any traveler passing through the land, when anyone sees a manÂ’s bone, he shall set up a marker by it, till the buriers have buried it in the Valley of Hamon Gog.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The name of the city will also be Hamonah. Thus they shall cleanse the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as for you, son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah, Speak to every sort of bird and to every beast of the field: Assemble yourselves and come; gather together from all sides to My sacrifice which I am sacrificing for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh and drink blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, of rams and lambs, of goats and bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall eat fat till you are full, and drink blood till you are drunk, at My sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall be filled at My table with horses and riders, with mighty men and with all the men of war, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will set My glory among the nations; all the nations shall see My judgments which I have executed, and My hand which I have laid on them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus the house of Israel shall know that I am Jehovah their God from that day forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the nations shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity; because they were unfaithful to Me, therefore I hid My face from them. I gave them into the hand of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I have dealt with them, and hidden My face from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Now I will bring back the captives of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house of Israel; and I will be jealous for My holy name;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>after they have borne their shame, and all their treachery in which they were unfaithful to Me, when they dwelt safely in their own land and no one made them afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When I have brought them back from the peoples and gathered them out of the lands of their enemies, and I am sanctified in them in the eyes of many nations,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>then they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who sent them into captivity among the nations, but also brought them back to their own land, and left none of them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I will not hide My face from them anymore; for I have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
