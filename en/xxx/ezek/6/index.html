Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, to the hills, to the ravines, and to the valleys: Behold I, even I, will bring a sword against you, and I will destroy your high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And your altars shall be desolate, your incense altars shall be broken, and I will cast down your slain before your idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will lay the corpses of the children of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones all around your altars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and found guilty, your idols broken and brought to an end, your incense altars cut down, and your works blotted out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the slain shall fall in your midst, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Yet I will leave a remnant, so that you may have some who escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered throughout the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those of you who escape will remember Me among the nations where they are carried captive, because I was crushed by their adulterous heart which has turned away from Me, and by their eyes which go whoring after their idols; they will loathe themselves for the evils which they did in all their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And they shall know that I am Jehovah; I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Strike with your hands and stamp with your feet, and say, Alas, for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! For they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>He who is far off shall die by the pestilence, he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus will I spend My fury upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then you shall know that I am Jehovah, when their slain are among their idols all around their altars, on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, under every green tree, and under every thick oak, wherever they offered soothing aromas to all their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus I will stretch out My hand against them and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblah, in all their dwelling places. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
