So it became a vine, brought forth branches, and put forth shoots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>There was another great eagle with large wings and many feathers; and behold, this vine bent its roots toward him, and stretched its branches toward him, away from the garden terrace where it had been planted, that he might water it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>It was planted in good soil by many waters, to bring forth branches, bear fruit, and become a majestic vine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Will it thrive? Will he not pull up its roots, cut off its fruit, and leave it to wither? All of its sprouting leaves will wither, and no great power or many people will be needed to pluck it up by its roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, being planted, will it prosper? Will it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the garden terrace where it sprouted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Say now to the rebellious house: Do you not know what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon has come to Jerusalem and has taken its king and rulers, and led them with him to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he has taken the kingÂ’s seed, made a covenant with him, and put him under oath. He also has taken away the mighty of the land,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that the kingdom might be low, that it might not lift itself up, but that by the keeping of his covenant it might stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But he rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt, that they might give him horses and many people. Will he prosper? Will he who does such things escape? Can he break a covenant and still be delivered?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place where the king dwells who made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, there he shall die with him in the midst of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nor will Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company do anything in the war, when they heap up a siege mound and build a wall to cut off many persons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Since he despised the oath by breaking the covenant, and in fact gave his hand and still did all these things, he shall not escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: As I live, surely My oath which he despised, and My covenant which he broke, I will recompense upon his own head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will spread My net over him, and he shall be taken in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon and judge him there for the treason by which he betrayed Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And all his fugitives with all his troops shall fall by the sword, and those who remain shall be scattered to every wind. And you shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will take also one of the highest branches of the high cedar and set it out. I will crop off from the topmost of its young twigs a tender one, and will plant it on a high and lofty mountain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>On the mountain height of Israel I will plant it; and it will bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a majestic cedar. And under it will dwell birds of every wing; in the shadow of its branches they will dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And all the trees of the field shall know that I, Jehovah, have brought down the high tree and exalted the low tree, dried up the green tree and made the dry tree flourish; I, Jehovah, have spoken and have done it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
