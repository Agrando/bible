You shall go from your place into exile to another place in their sight. It may be that they will consider, though they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>By day you shall bring out your belongings in their sight, as though going into captivity; and at evening you shall go in their sight, like those who go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Dig through the wall in their sight, and carry your belongings out through it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>In their sight you shall bear them on your shoulders and carry them out at twilight; you shall cover your face, so that you cannot see the ground, for I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So I did as I was commanded. I brought out my belongings by day, as though going into captivity, and at evening I dug through the wall with my hand. I brought them out at twilight, and I bore them on my shoulder in their sight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And in the morning the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said to you, What are you doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel who are among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Say, I am a sign to you. As I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the prince who is among them shall bear his belongings on his shoulder in the dark and go out. They shall dig through the wall to carry them out through it. He shall cover his face, so that he cannot see the ground with his eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will also spread My net over him, and he shall be caught in My snare. I will bring him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will scatter to every wind all who are around him to help him, and all his troops; and I will draw out the sword after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But I will leave of them a number of men from the sword, from famine, and from pestilence, that they may declare all their abominations among the nations wherever they go. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, eat your bread with quaking, and drink your water with trembling and anxiety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And say to the people of the land, Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with horror, so that her land may be emptied of all who are in it, because of the violence of all those who dwell in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall become desolate; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Son of man, what is this proverb that you people have about the land of Israel, which says, The days are prolonged, and every vision fails?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Tell them therefore, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will put an end to this proverb, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel. But say to them, The days are at hand, and the fulfillment of every vision.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For no more shall there be any false vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I, Jehovah, speak, and the Word which I speak will come to pass; it will no more be drawn out. For in your days, O rebellious house, I will say the word and perform it, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Son of man, behold, the house of Israel is saying, The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of times afar off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: None of My words will be drawn out any more, but the word which I speak will be done, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
