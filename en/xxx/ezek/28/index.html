There is no secret that can be hidden from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>With your wisdom and your understanding you have gained riches for yourself, and gathered gold and silver into your treasuries;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>by your great wisdom in trade you have increased your riches, and your heart is lifted up because of your riches).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have set your heart as the heart of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>behold, therefore, I will bring strangers against you, the most terrifying of the nations; and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom, and defile your splendor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They shall throw you down to the Pit, and you shall die the death of the slain in the midst of the seas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will you still think to say before him who slays you, I am God? But you are a man, and not a god, in the hand of him who slays you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers; for I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Son of man, take up a lamentation for the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You seal the measure, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You have been in Eden, the garden of God. Every precious stone was your covering: the sardius, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald with gold. The workmanship of your timbrels and pipes was prepared for you on the day you were created.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You were the anointed cherub that covers; I established you; you were on the holy mountain of God; you walked back and forth in the midst of fiery stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created, till iniquity was found in you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>By the abundance of your trading they filled your midst with violence, and you sinned; therefore I cast you as profane out of the mountain of God; and I destroyed you, O covering cherub, from the midst of the fiery stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. I have cast you to the ground, I have set you before kings, that they might observe you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your trading; therefore I bring fire from your midst; it has devoured you, and I consign you to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all who see you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>All who know you among the peoples have been astonished at you; you shall become a terror, and shall be no more forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Son of man, set your face toward Sidon, and prophesy against her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Sidon; I will be glorified in your midst; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I execute judgments in her and have been sanctified in her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I will send pestilence upon her, and blood into her streets; the slain shall fall in her midst by the sword which is against her on every side; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And there shall no longer be a pricking brier or a painful thorn unto the house of Israel from all who surround them, who despise them. And they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: When I have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered, and have been sanctified in them in the eyes of the nations, then they will dwell in their land which I gave to My servant Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they shall dwell safely there, build houses, and plant vineyards; yes, they will dwell securely, when I execute judgments on all those around them who despise them. And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
