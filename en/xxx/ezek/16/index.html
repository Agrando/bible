Yes, I said to you in your blood, Live!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>I have made you a multitude, like a plant in the field; and you grew, became great, bedecked with ornaments. Your breasts were formed, your hair grew, but you were naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When I passed by you again and looked upon you, indeed your time was the time of love; so I spread the edge of My garment over you and covered your nakedness. Yes, I swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then I washed you in water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood, and I anointed you with oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I clothed you in embroidered cloth and gave you sandals of badger skin; I clothed you with fine linen and covered you with silk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I adorned you with ornaments, put bracelets on your wrists, and a chain on your neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I put a ring in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown upon your head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus you were adorned with gold and silver, and your clothing was of fine linen, silk, and embroidered cloth. You ate of fine flour, honey, and oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, and succeeded to royalty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Your fame went out among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed upon you, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But you trusted in your own beauty, committed adultery because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>You took some of your garments and adorned multicolored high places for yourself, and committed adultery on them. Such things should not happen, nor be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You have also taken your beautiful jewelry from My gold and My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images and committed adultery with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you took your embroidered garments and covered them, and you set My oil and My incense before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also My food which I gave you; the fine flour, oil, and honey which I fed you; you set it before them as a soothing aroma; and so it was, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover you took your sons and your daughters, whom you bore to Me, and these you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Were your acts of harlotry a small matter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>that you have slain My children and offered them up to them by causing them to pass through the fire?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in all your abominations and acts of harlotry you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare, squirming in your blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And so it was, after all your wickedness (Woe, woe unto you! declares the Lord Jehovah);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>that you also built for yourself a mound, and made a high place for yourself in every open place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You built your high places at the head of every road, and made your beauty to be abhorred. You offered yourself to everyone who passed by, and multiplied your acts of harlotry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>You also committed adultery with the Egyptians, your very fleshly neighbors, and increased your acts of harlotry to provoke Me to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, therefore, I stretched out My hand against you, diminished your allotment, and gave you up to the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your licentious ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You also committed adultery with the Assyrians, because you were insatiable; indeed you committed adultery with them and still were not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moreover you multiplied your acts of harlotry in the land of Canaan, as far as Chaldea; and even then you were not satisfied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How weak is your heart! declares the Lord Jehovah, seeing you do all these things; the deeds of a domineering woman of prostitution.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You build your mound at the head of every road, and built your high place in every open place. Yet you were not like a prostitute, in that you scorned payment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You are an adulterous wife, who takes strangers instead of her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and bribe them to come to you from all around for your harlotry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You are the opposite of other women in your harlotry, because no one solicited you to be a prostitute. In that you gave payment but no payment was given you, therefore you are the opposite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now then, O prostitute! Hear the Word of Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because your filthiness was poured out and your nakedness uncovered in your harlotry with your lovers, and with all your abominable idols, and because of the blood of your children which you gave to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>surely, therefore, I will gather all your lovers with whom you took pleasure, all those you loved, and all those you hated; I will gather them from all around against you and will uncover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And I will judge you as women who commit adultery or who shed blood are judged; I will bring blood upon you in fury and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your mounds and break down your high places. They shall also strip you of your clothes, take your beautiful jewelry, and leave you naked and bare.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones and cut you with their swords.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women; and I will put an end to your harlotry, and you shall no longer hire lovers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So I will lay to rest My fury toward you, and My jealousy shall depart from you. I will be quiet, and be angry no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Because you did not remember the days of your youth, but agitated Me with all these things, surely I will also recompense your deeds upon your own head, says the Lord Jehovah. And you shall not commit licentiousness in addition to all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Indeed everyone who quotes proverbs will use this proverb against you: Like mother, like daughter!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>You are your motherÂ’s daughter, loathing her husband and children; and you are the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And your older sister is Samaria, who dwells with her daughters to the north of you; and your younger sister, who dwells to the south of you, is Sodom and her daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Yet you did not walk in their ways nor act according to their abominations; but, as if that were too little, you became more corrupt than they in all your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, neither your sister Sodom nor her daughters have done as you and your daughters have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw fit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Samaria did not commit half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters by all the abominations which you have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>You who judged your sisters, bear your own shame also, because your sins were more abominable than theirs; they are more righteous than you. Yes, be disgraced also, and bear your own shame, because you justified your sisters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>When I bring back their captives, the captives of Sodom and her daughters, and the captives of Samaria and her daughters, then I will also bring back the captives of your captivity among them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>so that you may bear your own shame and be disgraced by all that you did, since you comforted them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, return to their former state, and Samaria and her daughters return to their former state, then you and your daughters will return to your former state.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>before your wickedness was uncovered. It was like the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and all those around her, and of the daughters of the Philistines, who despise you from all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>You have paid for your licentiousness and your abominations, declares Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will deal with you as you have done, who have despised the oath by breaking the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>Nevertheless I will remember My covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>Then you will remember your ways and be ashamed, when you receive your older and your younger sisters; and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>And I will establish My covenant with you. And you shall know that I am Jehovah,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>so that you may remember and be ashamed. And you will never open your mouth anymore because of your shame, when I provide atonement for you for all that you have done, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
