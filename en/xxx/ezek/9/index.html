One man among them was clothed with linen and had a writers inkhorn at his side.

And He called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writers inkhorn at his side;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>and Jehovah said to him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and cry over all the abominations that are done within it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>To the others He said in my hearing, Go after him through the city and kill; do not let your eye spare, nor have pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Utterly slay old and young men, maidens and little children and women; but do not come near anyone on whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.
