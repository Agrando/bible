A lioness: she lay down among the lions; among the young lions she nourished her cubs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>She brought up one of her cubs, and he became a young lion; he learned to catch prey, and he devoured men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The nations also heard of him; he was trapped in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When she saw that she waited, that her hope was lost, she took another of her cubs and made him a young lion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He went around among the lions, and became a young lion; he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He knew their desolate places, and laid waste their cities; the land with its fullness was desolated by the sound of his roaring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the nations set against him from the provinces on every side, and spread their net over him; he was caught in their pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They put him in a cage with chains, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him in hunting nets, so that his voice should no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Your mother was like a vine in your blood, planted by the waters, fruitful and full of branches because of many waters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>She had strong branches for the scepters of rulers. She towered in stature above the thick branches, and was seen in her height amid the abundance of her branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit. Her strong branches were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Fire has gone out from a staff of her branches and devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong staff; a scepter for ruling. This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
