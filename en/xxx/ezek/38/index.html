In the last final years you will come into the land of those brought back from the sword and gathered from many peoples on the mountains of Israel, which had long been desolate; they were brought out of the nations, and now all of them dwell safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You will ascend, and come like a storm, covering the land like a cloud, you and all your troops and many people with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On that day it shall come to pass that thoughts will arise in your mind, and you will devise an evil plan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall say, I will go up against a land of unwalled villages; I will go to a people at peace, who dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>to plunder the spoils and to steal a prize, to stretch out your hand against the waste places that are again inhabited, and against a people gathered out of the nations, who produce livestock and goods, who dwell in the center of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sheba, Dedan, the merchants of Tarshish, and all their young lions will say to you, Have you come to plunder the spoils? Have you gathered your army to steal a prize, to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods, to plunder a great spoils?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say to Gog, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On that day when My people Israel dwell safely, will you not know it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And you shall come from your place out of the recesses of the north, you and many peoples with you, all of them riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And you will come up against My people Israel like a cloud, to cover the land. It shall be in the last final days that I will bring you against My land, so that the nations may know Me, when I am sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Are you he of whom I have spoken in former days by My servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied for years in those days that I would bring you against them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it shall come to pass on that day, when Gog comes against the land of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah, that My fury shall arise in My face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For in My jealousy and in the fire of My wrath I have spoken. Surely in that day there shall be a great earthquake in the land of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>so that the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, the beasts of the field, all creeping things that creep on the earth, and all men who are on the face of the earth shall quake at My presence. The mountains shall be thrown down, the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will call for a sword against him throughout all My mountains, declares the Lord Jehovah. Every manÂ’s sword shall be against his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And I will judge him with pestilence and blood; I will rain down upon him, on his troops, and on the many people who are with him, flooding rain, great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Thus I will magnify Myself and sanctify Myself, and I will be known in the eyes of many nations.
