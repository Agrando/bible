This city is the kettle, and we are the flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Spirit of Jehovah fell upon me, and said to me, Speak! Thus says Jehovah: Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the thoughts that come into your mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You have multiplied your slain in this city, and you have filled its streets with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Your slain whom you have laid in its midst, they are the flesh, and this city is the kettle; but I shall bring you out of the midst of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will bring you out of its midst, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and execute judgments against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall fall by the sword. I will judge you to the borders of Israel. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>This city shall not be your kettle, nor shall you be the flesh in its midst. I will judge you in the borders of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall know that I am Jehovah; for you have not walked in My statutes nor executed My judgments, but have done according to the customs of the nations which are all around you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And it happened, while I was prophesying, that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell on my face and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Will You make a complete end of the remnant of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Son of man, your brethren, your relatives, the men of your kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, are those to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Go far away from Jehovah; this land has been given to us as a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Although I have cast them far off among the nations, and although I have scattered them throughout the earth, yet I shall be a little sanctuary for them in the lands where they have gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, assemble you from the lands where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they will come there, and they will take away all its detestable things and all its abominations from there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that they may walk in My statutes and keep My judgments and do them; and they shall be My people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as for those whose hearts follow the desire for their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their deeds upon their own heads, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the cherubim lifted up their wings, with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city and stood on the mountain, which is on the east side of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Spirit lifted me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to those of the captivity. And the vision that I had seen went up from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So I spoke to those of the captivity all the things that Jehovah had shown me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
