Again he measured one thousand and brought me through; the water came up to the waist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Again he measured one thousand, and it was a river that I could not cross, for the water was too deep; water in which one must swim, a river that could not be crossed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he said to me, Son of man, have you seen this? And he brought me and returned me to the bank of the river.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When I returned, there, along the bank of the river, were very many trees on one side and the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then he said to me: This water flows toward the eastern region, goes down into the wilderness, and enters the sea. When it reaches the sea, its waters are healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it shall be that every living thing that swarms, wherever the rivers go, will live. There will be a very great multitude of fish, because these waters go there; for they will be healed, and everything will live wherever the river shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It shall be that fishermen will stand by it from En Gedi to En Eglaim; they will be places for spreading their nets. Their fish will be of the same kinds as the fish of the Great Sea, exceedingly many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be given over to salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And along the banks of the river, on this side and that, will grow all kinds of trees used for food; their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail. They will bear fruit every month, because their water flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: These are the borders by which you shall divide the land as an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall inherit it equally with one another; for I raised My hand and swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And this shall be the border of the land on the north: from the Great Sea, by the road to Hethlon, as one goes to Zedad,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), to Hazar Hatticon (which is on the border of Hauran).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus the boundary shall be from the Sea to Hazar Enan, the border of Damascus; and as for the north, northward, it is the border of Hamath. This is the north side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And on the east side you shall mark out the border from between Hauran and Damascus, and between Gilead and the land of Israel, along the Jordan, and to the Eastern Sea. This is the east side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the south side, toward the south, shall be from Tamar to the waters of Meribah by Kadesh, along the brook to the Great Sea. This is the south side, toward the South.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the west side shall be the Great Sea, from the southern boundary until one comes to a point opposite Hamath. This is the west side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus you shall divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it shall be that you will divide it by lot as an inheritance for yourselves, and for the strangers who sojourn among you and who bear children among you. They shall be to you as native-born among the children of Israel; they shall have an inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall be that in whatever tribe the stranger sojourns, there you shall give him his inheritance, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
