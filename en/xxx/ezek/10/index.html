And he went in before my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then the glory of Jehovah went up from the cherub, and paused over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even in the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And it happened, when He had commanded the man clothed in linen, saying, Take fire from among the wheels, from among the cherubim, that he went in and stood beside the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the cherub stretched out his hand from among the cherubim to the fire that was among the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed with linen, who took it and went out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And under the cherubims wings appeared the form of a mans hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And when I looked, behold, four wheels were beside the cherubim, one wheel beside one cherub and another wheel beside each other cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for their appearance, all four had one likeness; as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>When they went, they went toward any of their four directions; they did not turn aside when they went, but followed in the direction the head was facing. They did not turn aside as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And their whole body, with their back, their hands, their wings, and the wheels that the four had, were full of eyes all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing, Rolling Wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, the second face the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the cherubim were lifted up. This was the living creature that I saw by the River Chebar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels themselves did not turn from beside them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they stood still, these stood still; and when they rose up, these rose up; for the spirit of the living creature was in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the glory of Jehovah departed from the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the cherubim lifted their wings and mounted up from the earth before my eyes. When they went out, the wheels were beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the house of Jehovah, and the glory of the God of Israel was over them from above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>This is the living creature I saw under the God of Israel by the River Chebar, and I knew that they were cherubim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Each one had four faces and each one four wings, and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the likeness of their faces was the same as the faces which I had seen by the River Chebar, their appearance, even theirs. They each went straight forward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
