As I live, says the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then cause them to know the abominations of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On the day when I chose Israel and raised My hand and swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made Myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I raised My hand and swore to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On that day I raised My hand and swore to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then I said to them, Each of you, throw away the abominations which are before his eyes, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt. I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But they rebelled against Me and would not obey Me. They did not, each man, cast away the abominations which were before their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I said, I will pour out My fury upon them and fulfill My anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But I acted for My names sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were, in whose sight I had made Myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore I made them go out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I gave them My statutes and showed them My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Moreover I also gave them My Sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am Jehovah who sets them apart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the house of Israel rebelled against Me in the wilderness; they did not walk in My statutes; they despised My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them; and they greatly defiled My Sabbaths. Then I said, I will pour out My fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I acted for My names sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So I also raised My hand and swore to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because they despised My judgments and did not walk in My statutes, but profaned My Sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless My eye spared them from destruction. I did not make an end of them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor keep their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I am Jehovah your God. Walk in My statutes, keep My judgments, and do them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>set apart My Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am Jehovah your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless, the children rebelled against Me; they did not walk in My statutes, and did not keep My judgments, which, if a man does, he shall even live by them; but they profaned My Sabbaths. Then I said I would pour out My fury on them and fulfill My anger against them in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Nevertheless I withdrew My hand and acted for My names sake, that it should not be profaned in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I brought them out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I raised My hand and swore to those in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>because they had not executed My judgments, but had despised My statutes, profaned My Sabbaths, and their eyes followed after their fathers idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore I also gave them up to statutes that were not good, and judgments by which they could not live;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and I defiled them by their gifts, in that they caused all that open the womb to pass through the fire, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed Me, by being treacherously unfaithful to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For when I brought them into the land concerning which I had raised My hand and sworn to give it to them, and they saw all the high hills and all the thick trees, there they offered their sacrifices and provoked Me with their offerings. There they also sent up their soothing aroma and poured out their drink offerings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then I said to them, What is this high place to which you go? And its name is called Bamah to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Are you defiling yourselves in the manner of your fathers, and committing adultery with their abominations?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For when you offer your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols, even to this day. So shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will not be inquired of by you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>What you have in your mind shall never be, when you say, We will be like the nations, like the families in other lands, serving wood and stone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, surely with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out, I will rule over you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you are scattered, with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm, and with fury poured out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will plead with you face to face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Just as I judged your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against Me. I will bring them out of the land where they dwell, but they shall not enter into the land of Israel. And you will know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Go, serve every one of you his idols, even hereafter, if you will not obey me. But profane My holy name no more with your gifts and your idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For on My holy mountain, on the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, there all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, shall serve Me; there I will accept them, and there I will require your offerings and the firstfruits of your sacrifices, together with all your holy things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>I will accept you as a soothing aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the lands where you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I bring you into the land of Israel, into the land for which I raised My hand and swore to give it to your fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And there you shall remember your ways and all your evil deeds with which you were defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight because of all the evils that you have done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have dealt with you for My names sake, not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Furthermore the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Son of man, set your face toward the south; drop a word toward the south and prophesy against the forest land, the South,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and say to the forest of the South, Hear the Word of Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree and every dry tree in you; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be scorched by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>All flesh shall see that I, Jehovah, have kindled it; it shall not be quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Then I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! They say of me, Does he not speak parables?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
