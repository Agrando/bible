There they shall lay the set apart, holy, offerings; the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>When the priests enter them, they shall not go out of the holy room into the outer court; but there they shall leave their garments in which they minister, for they are holy. They shall put on other garments; then they may approach that which is for the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now when he had finished measuring the inner house, he brought me out through the gate that faces toward the east, and measured it all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He measured the east side with the measuring rod, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He measured the north side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He measured the south side, five hundred rods by the measuring rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He came around to the west side and measured five hundred rods by the measuring rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>He measured it on the four sides; it had a wall all around, five hundred cubits long and five hundred wide, to separate the holy from the profane.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
