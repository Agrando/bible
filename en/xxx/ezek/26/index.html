She is broken who was the gateway of the peoples; now she is turned over to me; I shall be filled; she is laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against you, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes its waves to come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they shall destroy the walls of Tyre and break down her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like a shiny rock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea, for I have spoken, says the Lord Jehovah; it shall become plunder for the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And her daughters who are in the fields shall be slain by the sword. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will bring against Tyre from the north Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, a king of kings, with horses, with chariots, and with horsemen, and a company of many people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He will slay your daughters with the sword in the fields; he will heap up a mound against you, build a siege wall against you, and raise a shield against you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He will set his battering rams against your walls, and with his axes he will break down your towers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because of the abundance of his horses, their dust will cover you; your walls will shake at the sound of the horsemen, the wheels, and the chariots, when he enters your gates, as men enter a city that has been breached.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>With the hooves of his horses he will trample all your streets; he will slay your people by the sword, and your strong pillars will fall to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they will plunder your riches and pillage your merchandise; they will break down your walls and destroy your pleasant houses; they will put your stones, your timber, and your soil in the midst of the water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I will put an end to the noise of your songs, and the sound of your harps shall be heard no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And I will make you like a shiny rock, you shall be a place for the spreading of nets, and you shall never be rebuilt; for I, Jehovah, have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah to Tyre: Will the coastlands not shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is slain in your midst?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then all the rulers of the sea will come down from their thrones, lay aside their robes, and take off their embroidered garments; they will clothe themselves with trembling; they will sit on the ground, tremble every moment, and be astonished at you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they will take up a lamentation for you, and say to you: How you have perished, O one inhabited by seafaring men, O renowned city, who was strong at sea, she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all her inhabitants!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the coastlands shall tremble in the day of your fall; Yes, the coastlands by the sea shall be troubled at your departure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: When I make you a desolate city, like cities that are not inhabited, when I bring the deep upon you, and great waters cover you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>then I will bring you down with those who descend into the Pit, with the people of old, and I will make you dwell in the lowest part of the earth, in places desolate from antiquity, with those who go down to the Pit, so that you may never be inhabited; and I shall establish glory in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will make you a terror, and you shall be no more; though you are sought for, you will never be found again, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
