The width of each side room all around the house was four cubits on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The side rooms were in three stories, one above the other, thirty rooms in each story; they rested on ledges which were for the side rooms all around, that they might be supported, but not fastened to the wall of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>As one went up from story to story, the side rooms became wider all around, because their supporting ledges in the wall of the house ascended like steps; therefore the width of the structure increased as one went up from the lowest story to the highest by way of the middle one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>I also saw the height of the house all around; the foundation of the side rooms was a full rod, that is, six cubits high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was five cubits, and so was also the remaining area of the side rooms of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And between it and the rooms was a width of twenty cubits all around the house on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The doors of the side rooms opened toward the open area, one door toward the north and another toward the south; and the width of the open area was five cubits all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The building that faced the separate area at its western end was seventy cubits wide; the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around, and its length ninety cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate area with the building and its walls was one hundred cubits long.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the width of the eastern face of the house, including the separate area, was one hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he measured the length of the building behind it, facing the separate area, with its galleries on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, as well as the inner temple and the porches of the court,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>their thresholds and the shuttered windows. And the galleries all around their three stories opposite the threshold were paneled with wood from the ground to the windows (the windows were covered),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>from the space above the door, even to the inner room, as well as outside, and on every wall all around, inside and outside, by measure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And it was made with cherubim and palm trees, a palm tree between cherub and cherub. And each cherub had two faces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>so that the face of a man was toward a palm tree on one side, and the face of a young lion toward a palm tree on the other side; thus it was made throughout the house all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>From the ground to the space above the door, and on the wall of the temple, cherubim and palm trees were carved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The doorposts of the temple were square, as was the front of the sanctuary; the appearance of the one was as the appearance of the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The altar of wood, was three cubits high, and its length two cubits. Its corners, its length, and its sides were of wood. And he said to me, This is the table that is before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The doors had two doors each, two turning doors: two for one door, and two doors for the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the temple just like the ones carved on the walls. And wooden planks were on the front of the porch outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There were shuttered windows and palm trees on one side and on the other, on the sides of the porch; also on the side rooms of the house and on the planks.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
