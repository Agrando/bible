So I ate, and it was in my mouth like honey for sweetness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then He said to me: Son of man, Go. Come to the house of Israel and speak My Words to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For you are not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, but to the house of Israel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the house of Israel is not willing to listen to you, because they are not willing to listen to Me; for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead; do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Moreover He said to me: Son of man, receive into your heart all My Words that I speak to you, and hear with your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And go! Come to the captives, to the children of your people, and speak to them and tell them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a great thunderous voice: Blessed is the glory of Jehovah from His place!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I also heard the sound of the wings of the living creatures touching one another, and the sound of the wheels alongside them, and a great thunderous sound.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then I came to the captives at Tel Abib, who dwelt by the River Chebar; and I sat where they sat, and remained there in shock among them seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now it came to pass at the end of seven days that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear the Word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I say to the wicked, You shall die the death, and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall live life because he took warning; and you have delivered your soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the hand of Jehovah was upon me there, and He said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and there I will talk with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So I arose and went forth into the plain. And behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, like the glory which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the Spirit entered into me and stood me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me: Go, shut yourself inside your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put ropes on you and bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be mute and not be one rebuking them, for they are a rebellious house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord Jehovah. He who hears, let him hear; and he who forbears, let him forbear; for they are a rebellious house.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
