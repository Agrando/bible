Behold, it is coming and shall be brought to pass, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Again the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says Jehovah! Say: A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>It is sharpened to slaughter and butcher, polished to flash like lightning! Should we then make mirth? It despises the scepter of My son, as every tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He has given it to be polished, that it may be handled; this sword is sharpened, and it is polished to be given into the hand of the slayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Cry and howl, son of man; for it will be against My people, against all the rulers of Israel. The sword will be thrown against My people; therefore slap your thigh,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>because it is a testing. And what if the sword despises even the scepter? It shall be no more, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike hand to hand; strike. The third time let the sword be doubled. It is the sword that slays, the sword that slays the great men, that surrounds them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I have set the slaughter of the sword against all their gates, That the heart may melt and many may stumble. Ah! It is made bright; it is grasped for the slaughter:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Be sharp to the right! Set yourself to the left; wherever your face is appointed!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I also will strike My hand to hand, and I will cause My fury to rest; I, Jehovah, have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Word of Jehovah came unto me again, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you, son of man, appoint for yourself two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall come forth from the same land. Make a sign; put it at the head of the road to the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Appoint a road for the sword to go into Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah, into fortified Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the road, at the head of the two roads, to use divination: he shakes the arrows, he consults the images, he looks at the liver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In his right hand is the divination for Jerusalem: to set up battering rams, to call for a slaughter, to lift the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to heap up a mound, and to build a siege wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it will be to them like a false divination in the eyes of those who have sworn oaths with them; but he will bring their iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken with the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now to you, O slain, wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, whose iniquity shall end,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>thus says the Lord Jehovah: Remove the turban, and take off the crown; nothing shall remain as it was. Exalt the humble, and humble the exalted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Ruin, ruin! I will ruin it! It shall be no more, until He comes whose right it is. And I will give it to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And you, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; and say, A sword, a sword is drawn, polished for slaughter, for consuming, for flashing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>while they see false visions for you, while they divine a lie to you, to bring you upon the necks of the slain, the wicked whose day has come, whose iniquity shall end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Return it to its sheath. I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And I will pour out My indignation upon you; I will blow against you with the fire of My wrath, and deliver you into the hands of brutal men who are skilled in destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>You shall be fuel for the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land. You shall not be remembered, for I, Jehovah, have spoken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
