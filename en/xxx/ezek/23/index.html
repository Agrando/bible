As for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem is Oholibah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Oholah committed adultery even though she was Mine; and she lusted for her lovers, the neighboring Assyrians,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>who were clothed in purple, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus she committed her adultery with them, all of them choice men of Assyria; and with all for whom she lusted, with all their idols, she defiled herself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has never given up her harlotry brought from Egypt, for in her youth they had lain with her, fondled her virgin breasts, and poured out their immorality upon her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, for whom she lusted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They uncovered her nakedness, took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword; she became a byword among women, for they had executed judgment on her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now although her sister Oholibah saw this, she became more corrupt in her lust than she, and in her harlotry, more than her sisters harlotry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She lusted for the neighboring Assyrians, captains and rulers, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then I saw that she was defiled; both the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But she added to her harlotry; she looked at men portrayed on the wall, images of Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>girded with waistbands around their waists, flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, in the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their birth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As soon as her eyes saw them, she lusted for them and sent messengers to them in Chaldea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the Babylonians came to her, into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their immorality; so she was defiled by them, and her soul was alienated from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So she uncovered her harlotry and uncovered her nakedness. Then My soul was alienated from her, just as My soul was alienated from her sister.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yet she multiplied her harlotry in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, when she had committed adultery in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For she lusted for her paramours, whose flesh is like the flesh of donkeys, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians fondled your nipples because of your youthful breasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, Oholibah, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will stir up your lovers against you, from whom your soul is alienated, and I will bring them against you from every side:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The Babylonians, all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, all the Assyrians with them, all of them desirable young men, governors and rulers, officers and men of renown, all of them riding on horses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, with a company of people. They shall array against you buckler, shield, and helmet all around. I will entrust judgment to them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I will set My jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you; they shall remove your nose and your ears, and the rest of you shall fall by the sword; they shall take your sons and your daughters, and the rest of you shall be devoured by fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your beautiful jewelry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Thus I will make you cease your lewdness and your harlotry brought from the land of Egypt, so that you will not lift your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will deliver you into the hand of those you hate, into the hand of those from whom your soul is alienated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>They will deal hatefully with you, take away all you have worked for, and leave you naked and bare. The nakedness of your adultery shall be uncovered, both your lewdness and your harlotry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>I will do these things to you because you have gone whoring after the nations, because you have become defiled by their idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore I will put her cup into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: You shall drink of your sisters cup, deep and wide; you shall be laughed to scorn and held in derision; for it contains much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, the cup of horror and desolation, the cup of your sister Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>You shall drink and drain it, you shall break its shards, and tear off your own breasts; for I have spoken, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have forgotten Me and cast Me behind your back, therefore you shall bear the penalty of your lewdness and your harlotry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Jehovah also said to me: Son of man, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands. They have committed adultery with their idols, and even sacrificed their sons whom they bore to Me, passing them through the fire, to devour them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Moreover they have done this to Me: They have defiled My sanctuary on the same day and profaned My Sabbaths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For after they had slain their children to their idols, on the same day they came into My sanctuary to profane it; and, lo, this they have done in the midst of My house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Furthermore you sent for men to come from afar, to whom a messenger was sent; and there they came. And you washed yourself for them, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with ornaments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>You sat on a stately couch, with a table prepared before it, on which you had set My incense and My oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the sound of a multitude at ease was with her, and drunkards were brought from the wilderness with men of the common sort, who put bracelets on their wrists and beautiful crowns on their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then I said concerning her who was worn out in adulteries, Will they commit adultery with her now, and she with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Yet they went in to her, as men go in to a woman of harlotry; thus they went in to Oholah and Oholibah, the lewd women.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And righteous men will judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: Bring up an assembly against them, give them up to terror and plunder.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And the company shall stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords. They shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Thus I will bring an end to lewdness from the land, that all women may be taught not to do according to your lewdness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And they shall repay you for your lewdness, and you shall pay for your idolatrous sins. And you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
