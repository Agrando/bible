The priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings. He shall bow down at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Likewise the people of the land shall bow down at the entrance to this gate before Jehovah on the Sabbaths and the new moons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the burnt offering that the prince offers to Jehovah on the Sabbath day shall be six lambs that are whole, and a ram that is whole;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and the grain offering shall be one ephah for a ram, and the grain offering for the lambs, as he shall be able to give, as well as a hin of oil with every ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull from the herd that is whole, six lambs, and a ram; they shall be ones that are whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he shall prepare a grain offering of an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as he is able for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And when the prince enters, he shall go in by way of the porch of the gate, and go out the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when the people of the land come before Jehovah on the appointed feasts, whoever enters by way of the north gate to bow down shall go out by way of the south gate; and whoever enters by way of the south gate shall go out by way of the north gate. He shall not return by way of the gate through which he came, but shall go out through the opposite gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the prince shall be in their midst. When they go in, he shall go in; and when they go out, he shall go out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>At the feasts and the appointed times the grain offering shall be an ephah for a bull, an ephah for a ram, as he is able to give for the lambs, and a hin of oil with every ephah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when the prince makes a voluntary burnt offering or voluntary peace offering to Jehovah, the gate that faces toward the east shall then be opened to him; and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he did on the Sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he goes out the gate shall be shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>You shall daily make a burnt offering to Jehovah of a lamb of the first year that is whole; you shall prepare it morning by morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And you shall prepare a grain offering with it every morning, a sixth of an ephah, and a third of a hin of oil to moisten the fine flour. This grain offering is a perpetual ordinance, to be made regularly to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus they shall prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, as a regular burnt offering every morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: If the prince gives a gift of some of his inheritance to any of his sons, it shall belong to his sons; it is their possession by inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But if he gives a gift of some of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty, after which it shall return to the prince. But his inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall become theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Moreover the prince shall not take any of the peopleÂ’s inheritance by evicting them from their possession; he shall provide an inheritance for his sons from his own possession, so that none of My people may be scattered from his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy rooms of the priests which face toward the north; and there was a place on the two sides westward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the grain offering, so that they do not bring them out into the outer court to consecrate the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then he brought me out to the outer court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, at every corner of the court there was another court.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>At the four corners of the court were enclosed courts, forty cubits long and thirty wide; all four corners were the same size.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>There was a row of building stones all around in them, all around the four of them; and cooking hearths were made under the rows all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said to me, These are the kitchens where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
