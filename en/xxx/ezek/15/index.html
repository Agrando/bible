Or can men make a peg from it on which to hang any vessel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Instead, it is thrown into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both ends of it, and its middle is burned. Is it useful for any work?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Indeed, when it was whole, no object could be made from it. How much less will it be useful for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I will give up the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and I will set My face against them. They will go out from one fire, but another fire shall devour them. And you shall know that I am Jehovah, when I set My face against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted treacherously unfaithfully, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
