And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the soles of calves feet. They sparkled like the color of burnished bronze.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the hands of a man were under their wings on their four sides; and each of the four had faces and wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their wings joined one to another. They did not turn when they went, but each one went straight forward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man; each of the four had the face of a lion on the right side, each of the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and each of the four had the face of an eagle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus were their faces. Their wings stretched upward; two wings of each one were joined to one another, and two covered their bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And each one went straight forward; they went wherever the spirit was to go, and they did not turn when they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches going back and forth among the living creatures. The fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the living creatures were running and returning, in appearance like a flash of lightning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now as I looked at the living creatures, behold, a wheel was on the earth beside the living creatures with its four faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>The appearance of the wheels and their workmanship was like the color of beryl, and all four had the same likeness. The appearance of their workmanship was, as it were, a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they moved, they went toward any one of four directions; they did not change directions as they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>As for their rims, they were so high that they were awesome; and their rims were full of eyes, all around the four of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Wherever the spirit was to go, there they went, where the spirit went; and the wheels were lifted up alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When those went, these went; when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up alongside them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>The likeness of the expanse above the heads of the living creatures was like the color of an awesome crystal, stretched out above over their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And under the expanse their wings spread out straight, one toward another. Each one had two which covered one side, and each one had two which covered the other side of their bodies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>When they went, I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of many waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a tumult like the sound of an army; and when they stood still, they let down their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And there was a voice from the expanse that was over their heads; whenever they stood, they let down their wings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And above the expanse over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. So when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
