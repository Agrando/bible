And I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys with your corpses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>I will also water the land with the flow of your blood, even to the mountains; and the ravines will be full of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When I extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and make its stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give its light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>All the bright lights of the heavens I will make dark over you, and bring darkness upon your land, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will also trouble the hearts of many peoples, when I bring your ruin among the nations, into the lands which you have not known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yes, I will make many peoples astonished at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid at you when I brandish My sword before them; and they shall tremble every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For thus says the Lord Jehovah: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>By the swords of the mighty, all of them the most terrifying of the nations, I will cause your multitude to fall. They shall plunder the majesty of Egypt, and all its multitude shall be destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will also destroy all its animals from beside its great waters; the foot of man shall muddy them no more, nor shall the hooves of animals stir them up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then I will make their waters settle, and make their rivers run like oil, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>When I make the land of Egypt desolate, and the land is destitute of all that once filled it, when I strike all who dwell in it, then they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This is the lamentation with which they shall lament her; the daughters of the nations shall lament her; they shall lament for her, for Egypt, and for all her multitude, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>It came to pass also in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, wail over the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down to the lowest parts of the earth, her and the daughters of the majestic nations, with those who go down to the Pit:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Whom do you surpass in beauty? Go down, be laid with the uncircumcised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They shall fall in the midst of those slain by the sword; she is delivered to the sword, drawing her and all her multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The mighty among the strong shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those who help him: they have gone down, they lie with the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Assyria is there, and all her company, with their graves all around her, all of them slain, fallen by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Her graves are set in the recesses of the Pit, and her company is all around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is Elam and all her multitude, all around her grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who have gone down uncircumcised to the lower parts of the earth, who caused their terror in the land of the living. Now they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They have set her bed in the midst of the slain, with all her multitude, with her graves all around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet they bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit; it was put in the midst of the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitudes, with all their graves around it, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though they caused their terror in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They do not lie with the mighty of the uncircumcised who are fallen, who have gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war; they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities will be on their bones, though the terror of the mighty was in the land of the living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yes, you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and lie with those slain by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>There is Edom, her kings and all her rulers, who with their might are laid beside those slain by the sword; they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go down to the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There are the rulers of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians, who have gone down with the slain, in shame at the terror which they caused by their might; they lie uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, and bear their shame with those who go down to the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Pharaoh will see them and be comforted over all his multitude, Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I have caused My terror in the land of the living; and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with those slain by the sword, Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
