Set your face against it, and it shall be under siege, and you shall lay siege against it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Lie also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. According to the number of the days that you lie on it, you shall bear their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when you have completed them, lie again on your right side; then you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days. I have laid on you a day for each year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem; your arm shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And surely I will put bands on you so that you cannot turn from one side to another till you have completed the days of your siege.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Also take for yourself wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt; put them into one vessel, and make bread of them for yourself, according to the number of days that you lie on your side; three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And your food which you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time you shall eat it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>You shall also drink water by measure, one-sixth of a hin; from time to time you shall drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall eat it as barley cakes; and bake it using dung of human excrement, in their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jehovah said, Even so shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So I said, Ah, Lord Jehovah! Behold, my soul has never been defiled from my youth till now; I have never eaten a carcass or a torn animal, nor has abominable flesh ever come into my mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then He said to me, See, I am giving you cow manure instead of human dung, and you shall prepare your bread over it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover He said to me, Son of man, behold, I will cut off the food supply in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and shall drink water by measure and in horror,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>that they may lack bread and water, and be appalled with one another, and waste away because of their iniquity.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
