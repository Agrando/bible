The end has come upon the four corners of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now the end has come upon you, and I will send My anger against you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will repay you for all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My eye will not spare you, nor will I have pity; but I will repay your ways, and your abominations will be in your midst; then you shall know that I am Jehovah!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: An evil! An only evil! Behold, it has come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>An end has come, the end has come; it has awakened against you; behold, it has come!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Morning has come to you, you who dwell in the land; the time has come, a day of trouble is near, and not a shout of rejoicing in the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now upon you I will soon pour out My fury, and spend My anger upon you; I will judge you according to your ways, and I will repay you for all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; I will repay you according to your ways, and your abominations that are in your midst. And you shall know that I am Jehovah who strikes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Behold, the day! Behold, it has come! Morning has gone forth; the staff has blossomed, pride has budded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Violence has risen up into a staff of wickedness; none of them shall remain, none of their multitude, none of their abundance, nor any eminent among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The time has come, the day draws near. Let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn, for wrath is upon all their multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the seller shall not return to what has been sold, though he may still be alive (for the vision concerns the whole multitude, and shall not change); no one will strengthen himself who lives in iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They have blown the trumpet and made everyone ready, but no one goes to battle; for My wrath is on all their multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The sword is outside, and the pestilence and famine within. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword; and whoever is in the city, famine and pestilence will devour him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Those who survive will escape and be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each for his iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Every hand will be feeble, and every knee will be as weak as water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They will also be girded with sackcloth; trembling will cover them; shame will be on every face, and baldness on all their heads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be like filthiness; their silver and their gold will not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Jehovah; they will not satisfy their souls, nor fill their stomachs, because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>As for the beauty of His ornaments, He set it in majesty; but they made from it the images of their abominations; their detestable things; therefore I have made it like refuse to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will give it as plunder into the hands of strangers, and to the wicked of the earth as spoils; and they shall defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>I will turn My face from them, and they will defile My secret place; for violent ones shall enter it and defile it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Make a chain, for the land is filled with bloody judgments, and the city is full of violence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I will bring the most evil of the nations, and they will possess their houses; I will bring an end to the pomp of the strong, and their holy places shall be defiled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Destruction comes! They will seek peace, but there shall be none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Disaster will come upon disaster, and rumor will be upon rumor. Then they will seek a vision from a prophet; but the Law will perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land will be terrified. I will do to them according to their way, and according to their judgment I will punish them. And they shall know that I am Jehovah!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
