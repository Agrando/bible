From there a fire will go out into all the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the midst of the nations and the lands all around her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And she has rebelled against My judgments by doing wickedness more than the nations, and against My statutes more than the lands that are all around her; for they have rejected My judgments, and they have not walked in My statutes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have multiplied disobedience more than the nations that are all around you, have not walked in My statutes nor kept My judgments, nor even done according to the judgments of the nations that are all around you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold I, even I, am against you and will execute judgments in your midst in the eyes of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will do in you what I have never done, and the likes of which I will never do again, because of all your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in your midst, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and all of you who remain I will scatter to all the winds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, as I live, says the Lord Jehovah, surely, because you have defiled My sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations, therefore I will also diminish you; My eye will not spare, nor will I have any pity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>A third of you shall die of the pestilence, and be consumed with famine in your midst; and a third shall fall by the sword all around you; and I will scatter the other third to all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus shall My anger be spent, and I will cause My fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted; and they shall know that I, Jehovah, have spoken in My zeal, when I have spent My fury upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Moreover I will make you a waste and a reproach among the nations that are all around you, in the eyes of all who pass by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So it shall be a reproach, a taunt, a chastening, and a horror to the nations that are all around you, when I execute judgments against you in anger and in fury and in furious punishment. I, Jehovah, have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>When I send against them the terrible arrows of famine which shall be for destruction, which I will send to destroy you, I will increase the famine upon you and cut off your food supply.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thus I will send against you famine and evil beasts, and they will bereave you. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword against you. I, Jehovah, have spoken.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
