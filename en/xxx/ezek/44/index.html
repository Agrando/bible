And it was shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And Jehovah said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened, and no man shall enter by it, because Jehovah the God of Israel has entered by it; therefore it shall be shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As for the prince, because he is the prince, he may sit in it to eat bread before Jehovah; he shall enter by way of the porch of the gate, and go out the same way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then He brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the house; and I looked, and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house of Jehovah; and I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jehovah said to me, Son of man, mark well, see with your eyes and hear with your ears, all that I say to you concerning all the ordinances of the house of Jehovah and all its laws.
