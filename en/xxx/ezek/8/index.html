So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, toward the north at the gate of the altar, was this image of jealousy at the entrance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Furthermore He said to me, Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary? Now turn again, you will see greater abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So He brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then He said to me, Son of man, dig into the wall; and when I dug into the wall, there was an opening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said to me, Go in, and see the evil abominations which they do there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I went in and saw; and behold, every sort of creeping thing, abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, carved all around on the wall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in their midst stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. Each man had a censer in his hand, and a thick cloud of incense went up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then He said to me, Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the room of his idols? For they say, Jehovah does not see us, Jehovah has forsaken the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He said to me, Turn again, and you will see greater abominations that they are doing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So He brought me to the door of the north gate of the house of Jehovah; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for Tammuz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then He said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Turn again, you will see greater abominations than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So He brought me into the inner court of the house of Jehovah; and behold, at the door of the temple of Jehovah, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple of Jehovah and their faces toward the east, and they were bowing down to the sun toward the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a trivial thing to the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here? For they have filled the land with violence; then they have returned to provoke Me to anger. Indeed they put the branch to their nose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore I also will act in fury. My eye will not spare nor will I have pity; and though they cry in My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
