The ancient heights have become our possession,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because they made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side, so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations, and you are taken up by the lips of talkers and slandered by the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the Word of the Lord Jehovah! Thus says the Lord Jehovah to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, the valleys, the desolate wastes, and the cities that have been forsaken, which became plunder and mockery to the rest of the nations all around;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I have spoken in My burning jealousy against the rest of the nations and against Edom, all who gave My land to themselves as a possession, with whole-hearted joy and spiteful minds, in order to plunder its open land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, the hills, the rivers, and the valleys, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I have spoken in My jealousy and My fury, because you have borne the shame of the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I have raised My hand and sworn that surely the nations that are around you shall bear their shame.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But you, O mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to My people Israel, for they are drawing near to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For indeed I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and be fruitful; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better for you than at your beginnings. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, My people Israel; they shall take possession of you, and you shall be their inheritance; no more shall you bereave them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because they say to you, You devour men and bereave your nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>therefore you shall devour men no more, nor bereave your nation anymore, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Nor will I let you hear the insults of the nations anymore, nor bear the reproach of the peoples anymore, nor shall you cause your nation to stumble anymore, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Moreover the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their land, they defiled it by their own ways and deeds. To Me their way was like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore I poured out My fury on them because of the blood they had shed on the land, and because of their idols with which they had defiled it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed throughout the earth. I judged them according to their ways and their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they came to the nations, wherever they went, they profaned My holy name. They said of them, These are the people of Jehovah, and they have come out of His land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I had compassion for My holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations, there where they went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I do not do this for your sake, O house of Israel, but for the sake of My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations, there where you went.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I will sanctify My great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, says the Lord Jehovah, when I am sanctified in you before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all the lands, and bring you into your own land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your defilement and from all your idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I will also give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you shall keep My judgments and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers. And you shall be My people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>I will deliver you from all your defilements. I will call for the grain and multiply it, and bring no famine upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the produce of your fields, so that you never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good; and you will loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let it be known to you that I do not do this for your sakes, says the Lord Jehovah. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And they will say, This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, Jehovah, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate. I, Jehovah, have spoken it, and I will do it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do this for them. I will increase their men like a flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Like a holy flock, like the flock of Jerusalem on its appointed feasts, so shall the ruined cities be filled with flocks of men. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
