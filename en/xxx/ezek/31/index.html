For they have all been delivered to death, to the lower parts of the earth, among the sons of men who go down to the Pit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: In the day when it went down to Sheol, I caused mourning. I covered the deep for it. I restrained its rivers, and the great waters were held back. I caused Lebanon to mourn for it, and all the trees of the field wilted because of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I made the nations shake at the sound of its fall, when I cast it down to Sheol together with those who descend into the Pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the depths of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They also went down to Sheol with it, with those slain by the sword; and those who were its arm, who dwelt in its shadows among the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>To which of the trees in Eden will you then be likened in glory and greatness? Yet you shall be brought down with the trees of Eden to the depths of the earth; you shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with those slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
