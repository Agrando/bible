Fill it with choice cuts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>take the choice of the flock. Also pile bones under it, boil it to boiling, and let the cuts simmer in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is in it, and whose scum is not gone from it! Bring it out piece by piece. Let no lot fall on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For her blood is in her midst; she set it on top of a rock; she did not pour it on the ground, to cover it with dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>That it may raise up fury and take vengeance, I have set her blood on top of a rock, that it may not be covered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the bloody city! I too will make the pyre great.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Heap on the wood, kindle the fire; cook the flesh well, mix in the spices, and let the bones be burned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then set the pot empty on the coals, that it may become hot and its bronze may burn, that its filthiness may be melted in it, that its scum may be consumed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>She has grown weary with toil, and her great scum has not gone from her. Let her scum be in the fire!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In your filthiness is lewdness. Because I have cleansed you, and you were not cleansed, you will not be cleansed of your filthiness anymore, till I have caused My fury to rest upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I, Jehovah, have spoken it; it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not hold back, nor will I spare, nor will I have compassion; according to your ways and according to your deeds they will judge you, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Also the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Son of man, behold, I am taking away from you the desire of your eyes with one stroke; yet you shall neither mourn nor weep, nor shall your tears run down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Groan in silence, make no mourning for the dead; bind your turban on your head, and put your sandals on your feet; do not cover your mustache, and do not eat the bread of men of sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So I spoke to the people in the morning, and at evening my wife died; and in the morning I did as I was commanded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things signify to us, that you behave so?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then I answered them, The Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Speak to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will profane My sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and daughters whom you left behind shall fall by the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you shall do as I have done; you shall not cover your mustaches nor eat the bread of men of sorrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Your turbans shall be on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you shall neither mourn nor weep, but you shall rot away in your iniquities and mourn with one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Thus Ezekiel is a sign to you; according to all that he has done you shall do; and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And you, son of man; will it not be in the day when I take from them their stronghold, their joy and their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that upon which they set their hearts, their sons and their daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>On that day one who escapes will come to you to cause you to hear it with your ears;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>on that day your mouth will be opened to him who has escaped; you shall speak and no longer be mute. Thus you will be a sign to them, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
