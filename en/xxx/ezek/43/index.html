His voice was like the sound of many waters; and the earth shone with His glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>It was like the appearance of the vision which I saw; like the vision which I saw when I came to destroy the city. The visions were like the vision which I saw by the River Chebar; and I fell on my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the glory of Jehovah came into the house by way of the gate which faces toward the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; and behold, the glory of Jehovah filled the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then I heard Him speaking to me from the house. And standing beside me was a Man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He said to me, Son of man, this is the place of My throne and the place of the soles of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever. No more shall the house of Israel defile My holy name, they nor their kings, by their harlotry or with the carcasses of their kings on their high places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>When they set their threshold by My threshold, and their doorpost by My doorpost, with a wall between them and Me, they have defiled My holy name by the abominations which they have done; therefore I have consumed them in My anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now let them put their harlotry and the carcasses of their kings far away from Me, and I will dwell in their midst forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Son of man, describe the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them measure the pattern.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them the design of the house and its arrangement, its exits and its entrances, its entire design and all its ordinances, all its forms and all its laws. Write it down in their sight, so that they may keep its whole design and all its ordinances, and do them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>This is the law of the house: The entire region around the mountaintop is set apart, holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These are the measurements of the altar in cubits (the cubit is one cubit and a handbreadth): the base one cubit high and one cubit wide, with a rim all around its edge of one span. This is the upper part of the altar:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>from the base on the ground to the lower ledge, two cubits; the width of the ledge, one cubit; from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge, four cubits; and the width of the ledge, one cubit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The altar hearth is four cubits high, with four horns extending upward from the hearth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the altar hearth is twelve cubits long, twelve wide, square at its four corners;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>the ledge, fourteen cubits long and fourteen wide on its four sides, with a rim of half a cubit around it; its base, one cubit all around; and its steps face toward the east.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord Jehovah: These are the ordinances for the altar on the day when it is made, for sacrificing burnt offerings on it, and for sprinkling blood on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And you shall give a young bull for a sin offering to the priests, the Levites (who are of the seed of Zadok, who approach Me to serve Me), says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You shall take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and on the rim around it; thus you shall cleanse it and make atonement for it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then you shall also take the bull of the sin offering, and burn it at the appointed place of the house, outside the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>On the second day you shall offer a kid of the goats that is whole for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as they cleansed it with the bull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When you have finished cleansing it, you shall offer a young bull that is whole, and a ram that is whole from the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And you shall offer them before Jehovah, and the priests shall throw salt on them, and they shall offer them up as a burnt offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Every day for seven days you shall prepare a he goat for a sin offering; they shall also prepare a young bull and a ram from the flock, both that are whole.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Seven days they shall make atonement for the altar and purify it, and consecrate it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when these days are completed, it shall be, on the eighth day and thereafter, that the priests shall offer your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar; and I will accept you, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
