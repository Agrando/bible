Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you said, Aha! against My sanctuary when it was profaned, and against the land of Israel when it was desolate, and against the house of Judah when they went into captivity,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>behold, therefore, I will deliver you as a possession to the men of the East, and they shall set their encampments among you and make their dwellings among you; they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks.
