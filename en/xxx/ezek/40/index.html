He had a line of flax and a measuring rod in his hand, and he stood in the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And the man said to me, Son of man, look with your eyes and hear with your ears, and fix your mind on everything I show you; for you were brought here so that I might show them to you. Declare to the house of Israel everything you see.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now there was a wall all around the outside of the house. In the manÂ’s hand was a measuring rod six cubits long, each being a cubit and a handbreadth; and he measured the width of the structure, one rod; and the height, one rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Then he went to the gate which faced east; and he went up its stairs and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one rod wide, and the other threshold was one rod wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Each guardroom was one rod long and one rod wide; between the guardrooms was a space of five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the inside gate was one rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He also measured the porch of the inside gate, one rod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then he measured the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the pillars, two cubits. The porch of the gate was on the inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And in the eastward gate were three guardrooms on one side and three on the other; the three were all the same size; also the pillars were of the same size on this side and that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He measured the width of the entrance to the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the space in front of the guardrooms was one cubit on this side and one cubit on that side; the guardrooms were six cubits on this side and six cubits on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then he measured the gate from the roof of one guardroom to the roof of the other; the width was twenty-five cubits, as door faces door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He measured the pillars, sixty cubits high, and the court all around the gate extended to the pillar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>From the front of the entrance gate to the front of the porch of the inner gate was fifty cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And there were shuttered windows in the guardrooms and in their pillars on the inside of the gate all around, and likewise in the arches. There were windows all around on the inside. And on each pillar were palm trees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then he brought me into the outer court; and there were rooms and a pavement made all around the court; thirty rooms faced the pavement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The pavement was by the side of the gates, corresponding to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then he measured the width from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner court exterior, one hundred cubits toward the east and the north.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>On the outer court was also a gate facing north, and he measured its length and its width.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Its guardrooms, three on this side and three on that side, its pillars and its arches, had the same measurements as the first gate; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Its windows and those of its porches, and also its palm trees, had the same measurements as the gate facing east; they went up to it by seven steps, and its arches were in front of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the gate of the inner court was opposite the northern gate, just as the eastern gate; and he measured from gate to gate, one hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>After that he brought me toward the south, and there a gate was facing south; and he measured its pillars and arches according to these same measurements.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>There were windows in it and its arches all around like those windows; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Seven steps led up to it, and its arches were in front of them; and it had palm trees on its pillars, one on this side and one on that side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>There was also a gate on the inner court, facing south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south, one hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he brought me to the inner court through the southern gate; and he measured the southern gate according to these same measurements.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And its guardrooms, its pillars, and its arches were according to these same measurements; there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>There were arches all around, twenty-five cubits long and five cubits wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And its arches faced the outer court, palm trees were on its pillars, and going up to it were eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he brought me into the inner court facing east; he measured the gate according to these same measurements.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Also its guardrooms, its pillars, and its arches were according to these same measurements; and there were windows in it and in its arches all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Its arches faced the outer court, and palm trees were on its pillars on this side and on that side; and going up to it were eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he brought me to the north gate and measured it according to these same measurements;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>also its guardrooms, its pillars, and its arches. It had windows all around; its length was fifty cubits and its width twenty-five cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Its pillars faced the outer court, palm trees were on its pillars on this side and on that side, and going up to it were eight steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>There was a room and its entrance by the pillars of the gate, where they washed the burnt offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, on which to slay the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>At the outer side of the porch, as one goes up to the entrance of the northern gate, were two tables; and on the other side of the porch of the gate were two tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Four tables were on this side and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate, eight tables on which they slaughtered the sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>There were also four tables of hewn stone for the burnt offering, one cubit and a half long, one cubit and a half wide, and one cubit high; on these they laid the instruments with which they slaughtered the burnt offering and the sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Inside were hooks, a handbreadth wide, fastened all around; and the flesh of the sacrifices was on the tables.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Outside the inner gate were the rooms for the singers in the inner court, one facing south beside the northern gate, and the other facing north beside the southern gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then he said to me, This room which faces south is for the priests who have charge of the house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>The room which faces north is for the priests who have charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok, from the sons of Levi, who come near Jehovah to serve Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide, foursquare.
