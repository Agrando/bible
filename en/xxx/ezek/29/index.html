I have given you as food to the beasts of the field and to the birds of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>When they took hold of you by the hand, you broke and tore all their shoulders; when they leaned on you, you broke and made all their loins stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will bring a sword upon you and cut off from you man and beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the land of Egypt shall become desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, because he has said, The River is mine, and I have made it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Indeed, therefore, I am against you and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from Migdol to Syene, even to the border of Ethiopia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Neither foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it, and it shall be uninhabited forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the lands that are desolate; and among the cities that are laid waste, her cities shall be desolate forty years; and I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them throughout the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yet, thus says the Lord Jehovah: At the end of forty years I will gather Egypt from the peoples there where they were scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will bring back the captives of Egypt and cause them to return to the land of Pathros, to the land of their origin, and there they shall be a lowly kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It shall be the lowliest of kingdoms; it shall never again exalt itself above the nations, for I will diminish them so that they will not rule over the nations anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>No longer shall it be the confidence of the house of Israel, but will remind them of their iniquity when they turned to follow them. And they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, on the first day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to work hard against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder rubbed raw; yet neither he nor his army received wages from Tyre, for the labor which they expended on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Surely I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He shall take away her wealth, carry off her plunder, and remove her spoils; and that will be the wages for his army.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I have given him the land of Egypt for his labor, because they worked for Me, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In that day I will cause the horn of the house of Israel to spring forth, and I will open your mouth to speak in their midst. And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
