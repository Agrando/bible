But Jehovah has not sent them; yet they hope that their word may be confirmed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Have you not seen a vain vision, and have you not spoken a lying divination? You say, Jehovah declares; though I have not spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because you have spoken vanity and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And My hand will be against the prophets who see vanity and who divine lies; they shall not be in the council of My people, nor be written in the record of the house of Israel, nor shall they enter into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because, indeed, because they have seduced My people, saying, Peace! when there is no peace; and one builds a wall, and plasters it with whitewash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Say to those who plaster it with whitewash, that it will fall. There will be a flooding rain, and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall break it down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Surely, when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you, Where is the mortar with which you plastered it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus I will break down the wall you have plastered with whitewash, and bring it down to the ground, so that its foundation will be uncovered; it will fall, and you shall be consumed in the midst of it. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Thus will I accomplish My wrath on the wall and on those who have plastered it with whitewash; and I will say to you, The wall is no more, nor those who plastered it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>that is, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Likewise, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy against them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and say, Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Woe to the women who sew amulets on their sleeves and make veils for the heads of people of every height, to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of My people, and save the souls alive to yourselves?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And will you profane Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, executing souls that should not die, and keeping alive the souls that should not live, by your lying to My people who listen to lies?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against your amulets by which you hunt souls to make them fly. I will tear them from your arms, and let the souls go, the souls you hunt to make them fly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will also tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be as prey in your hand. And you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not pained; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to restore his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore you shall no longer see vanity nor divine divinations; for I will deliver My people out of your hand, and you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
