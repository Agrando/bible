From Migdol to Syene those within her shall fall by the sword, declares the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they shall be desolate in the midst of the desolate lands, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are laid waste.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And they will know that I am Jehovah, when I have set a fire in Egypt and all her helpers have been destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>In that day messengers shall go forth from Me in ships to make the confident Ethiopians afraid, and great anguish shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for indeed it is coming!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also bring an end to the multitude of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>He and his people with him, the most ruthless of the nations, shall be brought to destroy the land; they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of evil ones; I will make the land waste, and all that is in it, by the hand of strangers. I, Jehovah, have spoken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: I will also destroy the idols, and remove the images from Noph; there shall no longer be a prince of the land of Egypt; and I will put fear in the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>I will make Pathros desolate, set fire to Zoan, and execute judgments in No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I will pour My fury on Sin, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and set a fire in Egypt; Sin shall writhe in anguish, No shall be split open, and Noph shall be in daily distress.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The young men of Aven and Pibeseth shall fall by the sword, and these cities shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>At Tahpanhes the day shall also be darkened, when I break the yokes of Egypt there. And her arrogant strength shall come to an end in her; as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus I will execute judgments on Egypt, and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, on the seventh day of the month, that the Word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and see, it has not been bound up for healing, nor a bandage set to bind it, to make it strong to hold a sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I am against Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and will break his arms, both the strong one and the one that was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I will scatter Egypt among the nations, and disperse them throughout the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put My sword in his hand; but I will break PharaohÂ’s arms, and he will groan before him with the groanings of a mortally wounded man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thus I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down.
