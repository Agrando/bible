It shall be holy throughout its borders all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Of this there shall be a square plot for the sanctuary, five hundred by five hundred rods, with fifty cubits around it for an open space.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So this is the district you shall measure: twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide; in it shall be the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>It shall be a holy portion of the land for the priests, the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to serve Jehovah; it shall be a place for their houses and a sacred place for the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>An area twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide shall be for the Levites, the ministers of the house; they shall have twenty rooms as a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>You shall appoint as the property of the city an area five thousand cubits wide and twenty-five thousand long, next to the set-apart offerings; it shall belong to the whole house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the prince shall have a portion on both sides of the set-apart offerings and the citys portion; facing the set-apart offerings and the citys portion, extending westward on the west side and eastward on the east side, the length shall be alongside one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The land shall be his possession in Israel; and My rulers shall no more oppress My people, but they shall give the rest of the land to the house of Israel, according to their tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: Enough, O rulers of Israel! Put away violence and plundering, execute justice and righteousness, and stop dispossessing My people, says the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>You shall have honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The ephah and the bath shall be of the same measure, so that the bath contains one-tenth of a homer, and the ephah one-tenth of a homer; their measure shall be according to the homer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels shall be your maneh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is the offering which you shall offer: one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of wheat, and one-sixth of an ephah from a homer of barley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The ordinance concerning oil, the bath of oil, is one-tenth of a bath from a kor.
