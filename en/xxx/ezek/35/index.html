And you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Because you have had an ancient hatred, and have shed the blood of the children of Israel by the power of the sword at the time of their calamity, when their iniquity had come to an end;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will prepare you for blood, and blood shall pursue you. Since you have not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Thus I will make Mount Seir a desolate waste, and cut off from it the one who passes through and the one who returns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And I will fill its mountains with the slain; on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines those who are slain by the sword shall fall.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>I will make you desolate forever, and your cities shall not again be inhabited; and you shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Because you have said, These two nations and these two lands shall be mine, and we will possess them (although Jehovah was there),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>therefore, as I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, I will do according to your anger and according to the envy which you showed in your hatred against them; and I will make Myself known among them when I judge you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And you shall know that I am Jehovah. I have heard all your blasphemies which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are desolate; they are given to us to consume.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus with your mouth you have boasted against Me and multiplied your words against Me; I have heard them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thus says the Lord Jehovah: The whole earth will rejoice when I make you desolate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>As you rejoiced because the inheritance of the house of Israel was desolate, so I will do to you. You shall be desolate, O Mount Seir, as well as all of Edom; all of it! And they shall know that I am Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
