Teach and exhort these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to sound words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>he is proud, understanding nothing, but is sick with disputes and arguments over words, from which come envy, strife, slander, evil conjecture,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>useless wranglings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth, who suppose that godliness is a means of gain. From such withdraw yourself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is evident that we can carry nothing out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But those who purpose to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and harmful lusts which plunge people into ruin and destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For the love of money is a root of all evils, for which some being greedy, have strayed from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you, O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which you were also called and have confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I charge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>that you keep the commandment without spot, blameless until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>which He will reveal in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Command those who are rich in this present age not to be high-minded, nor to trust in the uncertainty of riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>storing up for themselves a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Timothy, guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and empty babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>by professing it some have strayed concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
