Or is it gain to Him that you make your ways perfect?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Is it because of your reverence that He corrects you, and enters into judgment with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is not your wickedness great, and your iniquities without end?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For you have taken a pledge from your brother for no reason, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>You have not given the weary water to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But the man of strength possesses the land, and the honorable man dwells in it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>You have sent widows away empty, and crushed the arms of the fatherless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden dread terrifies you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>or darkness so that you cannot see; and an abundance of water covers you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is not God in the height of the heavens? And see the highest stars, how lofty they are!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you say, What does the Mighty God know? Can He judge through the deep darkness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Thick clouds cover Him, so that He cannot see, and He walks above the circle of the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Will you keep to the old way which wicked men have trod,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who were snatched away before their time, whose foundations were poured out by the flood?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>They said to the Mighty God, Depart from us! What can the Almighty do to them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Yet He filled their houses with good things. But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The righteous see it and are glad, and the innocent have them in derision:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Surely, are not our adversaries cut down; and the fire consumes their remnant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now be useful to Him, and be at peace; thereby good shall come to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Receive, now, the Law from His mouth, and lay up His Words in your heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up; you shall remove injustice far from your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then you shall lay up your gold as the dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Yea, the Almighty will be your gold and your esteemed silver;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>for then you shall have your delight in the Almighty, and lift up your face unto God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>You shall make your supplication to Him, He will hear you, and you shall make good your vows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be confirmed for you; and light shall shine on your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When you have been made low, then you will say in your heart, It was pride. Then He will save the lowly of eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He will deliver one who is not innocent; yea, he will deliver by the purity of your hands.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
