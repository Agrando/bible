Or can you keep watch for when the deer gives birth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they bring forth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>when they crouch, bring forth their young, and deliver their pangs?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Their young ones are healthy, they grow up with grain; when they have departed they do not return to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who set the wild donkey free? Who loosed the bands of the wild ass,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwelling?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He scorns the tumult of the city; he does not heed the clamor of the driver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The mountain ranges are his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Will the oryx consent to serve you? Will he pass the night by your feeding trough?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Can you bind the oryx in the furrow with ropes? Or will he harrow the valleys after you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Will you trust him because his strength is great? Or will you leave your labor to him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Will you trust him to bring back your grain, and gather it to your threshing floor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Have you made the wings of the ostrich flap joyously, or the wings and feathers of the stork?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For she leaves her eggs on the ground, and warms them in the dust;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>she does not care that a foot may crush them, or that a beast of the field may trample them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>She treats her young roughly, as if they were not hers; her labor is in vain without fear,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>because God has caused her to forget wisdom, and has not imparted understanding to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When she lifts herself on high, she laughs at the horse and its rider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Have you given the horse its strength? Have you clothed its neck with a mane?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Can you make him leap like a locust? His majestic snorting strikes terror.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength; he goes forth to meet the weapons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed; nor does he turn back from the sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and javelin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He swallows the ground with rumbling and agitation; nor does he stand still at the sound of the shofar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Every time the shofar sounds he says, Aha! He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of captains and shouting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, and spread its wings toward the south?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Does the eagle mount up at your mouth, and make its nest on high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>It settles down and dwells on the rocks, on the crag of the rock and the stronghold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>From there it searches for food; its eyes see great distances.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Its young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are, there it is.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
