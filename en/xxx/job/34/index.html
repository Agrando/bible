My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For he has said, It profits a man nothing when he is pleasing to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Therefore listen to me, you men with heart: far be it from the Mighty God to do wickedness, and from the Almighty to do injustice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He repays man according to his work, and causes him to attain according to his way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Surely the Mighty God will never do wickedly, nor will the Almighty pervert justice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Who has given Him charge over the earth? Or who appointed Him over the whole world?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If He should set His heart on it, if He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>all flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If you have understanding, hear this; listen to the sound of my words:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn a righteous mighty one?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Is it fitting to say to a king, You are worthless; and to nobles, You are wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He is not partial to rulers, nor does He regard the rich more than the poor; for they are all the work of His hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In a moment they die, in the middle of the night; people convulse and pass away; the mighty are taken away without a hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For His eyes are on the ways of man, and He sees all his steps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>There is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For He does not lay more upon man, that he should go before the Mighty God in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>He breaks mighty men in pieces without inquiry, and makes others stand in their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore he knows their works; He overthrows them in the night, and they are crushed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>He chastises them as wicked men, in a place where others can see,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>because they have turned aside from following Him, and have not considered any of His ways,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>so that they cause the cry of the poor to come to Him; for He hears the cry of the lowly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>When He gives quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hides His face, who then can see Him? It might be against a nation or mankind altogether,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>so that the hypocrite should not reign, lest the people be ensnared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For has anyone said to the Mighty God, I have endured; I will offend no more;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>teach me what I do not see; if I have done injustice, I will do no more?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Shall He recompense on your terms, just because you have rejected it? You must choose, and not I; therefore speak what you know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Men with heart say to me, wise men who listen to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Job speaks without knowledge, his words are without insight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Oh, that Job were tried to the utmost, because his answers are like those of wicked men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against the Mighty God.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
