Are not his days also like the days of a hired man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Like a servant who pants for the shade, and like a hired man who waits eagerly for his wages,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>so I have been allotted months of futility, and restless nights have been appointed to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise from the long night? For I have had my fill of tossing until the twilight of the dawn.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>My flesh is clothed with worms and clods, my skin is hardened and cracked and oozes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>My days are swifter than a weaverÂ’s shuttle, and are used up without hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>O remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never return to see good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The eye of him who sees me shall watch me no more; while your eyes are upon me, I am not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>As the cloud vanishes and goes away, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He shall never again return to his house, nor shall his place know him anymore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the distress of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Am I a sea, or a sea serpent, that You set a guard over me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When I say, My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>then You scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that my soul chooses strangling and death rather than my body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>I loathe my life; I would not live forever.

What have I done to You, O Watcher of men? Why have You set me as Your target, so that I am a burden to myself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Why then do You not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? For now I will lie down in the dust, and You shall seek me diligently, but I will no longer be.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
