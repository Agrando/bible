Or do You see as man sees?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Are Your days like the days of mortal man? Are Your years like the days of a mighty man,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that You should seek out my iniquity and search out my sin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>although You know that I am not wicked, and there is no one who can rescue out of Your hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Your hands have made me and fashioned me together all around; yet You swallow me up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Remember, I beseech You, that You have made me like clay.
