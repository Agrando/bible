So I have proclaimed what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Grant me this request, and I will speak: I will inquire of You, and You declare to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye has seen You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore I despise myself, and have repented in dust and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And so it was, after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, that Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath has been kindled against you and your two friends, for you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Now therefore, take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, go to My servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and My servant Job will pray for you; for I accept him; lest I deal with you according to your folly; because you have not spoken of Me what is right, as My servant Job has.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as Jehovah commanded them; for Jehovah accepted Job.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah returned what had been taken captive from Job when he prayed for his friends. Indeed Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been his acquaintances before, came to him and ate food with him in his house; and they consoled him and comforted him for all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him. Each one gave him a piece of money and each a ring of gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jehovah blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; for he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and one thousand female donkeys.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>He also had seven sons and three daughters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>In all the land were found no women so beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and grandchildren to four generations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So Job died, old and full of days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
