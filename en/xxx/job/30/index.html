Their vigor has perished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>They are gaunt from want and famine, gnawing the dry ground recently made desolate and waste;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>who pluck mallow by the bushes, and broom tree roots for their food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They were driven out from the midst; they shouted at them as against a thief;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>to dwell in the ravines of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Among the bushes they brayed, under the nettles they huddled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They were sons of fools, yea, sons without a name; they were scourged from the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And now I am their taunting song; yea, I am their byword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They abhor me, they keep far from me; they do not refrain from spitting in my face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Because He has loosed His bowstring and afflicted me, they have cast off restraint before me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>At my right hand the brood arises; they push away my feet, and they raise against me their ways of destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They have broken up my path, they profit from my calamity; they have no helper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They come as broad breakers; under the devastation they roll along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Terrors are turned upon me; they pursue my honor as the wind, and my prosperity has vanished like a cloud.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction take hold of me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My bones are pierced in me at night, and my gnawing pains take no rest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>By great force my garment is disfigured; it binds me about as the collar of my coat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>I cry out to You, but You do not answer me; I stand up, and You pay no attention to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But You have changed to be cruel to me; with the strength of Your hand You oppose me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>You lift me up to the wind and cause me to ride on it; You dissipate me in the storm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I know that You will bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Surely He would not stretch out His hand against a heap of ruins.
