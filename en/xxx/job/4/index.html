But who can restrain words?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Surely you have instructed many, and you have strengthened weak hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But now it comes upon you, and you are weary; it touches you, and you are dismayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not your reverence your confidence? And the integrity of your ways your hope?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Remember now, who ever perished being innocent? Or where were the upright ever cut off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Even as I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>By the breath of God they perish, and by the breath of His nostrils they are destroyed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>The roaring of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions are broken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now a word was brought to me by stealth, and my ear received a whisper of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the uncertainties from the visions of the night, when a man falls into deep sleep,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>fear and trembling befell me, which made all my bones dread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair on my flesh stood up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes in silence; then I heard a voice saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Is mortal man more righteous than God? Is a strong man more pure than his Maker?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Behold He puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>even more so those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the grass!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They are crushed from morning till evening; they perish forever, with no one regarding.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Is not their own excellence within them removed? They die, even without wisdom.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
