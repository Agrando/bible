The wilderness yields food for them and for their young.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>They gather their fodder in the field and glean in the vineyard of the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They lodge the naked without clothing, with no covering against the cold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and hug the rock for want of shelter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They seize the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge from the poor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They cause them to go naked, without clothing; and they take away the sheaves from the hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They press out oil within their walls, and tread winepresses, but are thirsty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Men groan from the city, and the souls of the wounded cry out; yet God does not charge them with folly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They rebel against the Light; they have not recognized its ways nor stayed in its paths.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The murderer rises at daylight; he kills the poor and needy; and in the night he is like a thief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me; and puts a covering over his face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>In the dark they dig through into houses which they have marked for themselves by day; they do not know the light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For the morning is the same to them as deep darkness; they know the terrors of deep darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They are swift on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; they do not turn into the way of the vineyards.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>As drought and heat consume the snow waters, so Sheol consumes those who have sinned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The womb shall forget him, the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be remembered no more, and injustice shall be broken like a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>He mistreats the barren who do not bear, and does no good to the widow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He also draws the mighty away with his strength; he rises up, but no one is sure of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He gives them security, and they trust in it; yet His eyes are on their ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>They are exalted for a little while, then they are gone.
