And if it were, why should my spirit not be impatient?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Look at me and be astonished; put your hand over your mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Even when I remember I am terrified, and trembling takes hold of my flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Why do the wicked live and become old, yea, and become mighty in power?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their seed is established in their presence, and their offspring before their eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their houses are at peace, without dread; neither is the rod of God upon them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Their bull has bred without failure; their cow calves and does not miscarry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice to the sound of the flute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment go down to Sheol.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yet they say to the Mighty God, Depart from us, for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit do we have if we entreat Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, their goodness is not in their hand! The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>How often is the lamp of the wicked put out! How often does their calamity come upon them, the sorrows God distributes in His anger!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>They are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that a storm steals away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>God treasures up oneÂ’s iniquity for his children. He recompenses him, that he may know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For what is his delight in his house after him, when the number of his months has been cut off?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Can anyone teach the Mighty God knowledge, since He judges those that are on high?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>One dies in his full strength, being wholly secure and at ease;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>his pails are full of milk, and the marrow of his bones is moist.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, never having eaten with pleasure.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They lie down together in the dust, and worms cover them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Behold, I know your thoughts, and the plots with which you would do me wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For you say, Where is the house of the noble one? And where is the tent, the dwelling place of the wicked?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Have you not asked those who pass along the road? And do you not know their trademarks?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the wicked are reserved for the day of calamity; they shall be brought out on the day of wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Who declares his way to his face? And who repays him for what he has done?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Yet he shall be brought to the grave, and a vigil kept over the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him; everyone shall drag along after him, as countless ones before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>How then do you comfort me with vanity, since treachery remains in your answers?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
