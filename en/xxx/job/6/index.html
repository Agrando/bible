Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My soul refuses to touch them; they are as sickening food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant me the thing that I long for;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>that it would please God to crush me, that He would loose His hand and cut me off!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then I would still have comfort; though in anguish, I would leap for joy; let Him not spare; for I have not hidden the Words of the Holy One.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>What strength do I have, that I should hope? And what is my end, that I should prolong my life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh bronze?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Is my help not within me? And is wisdom driven from me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>To him who is despairing, kindness should be shown by his friend; but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>My brothers have dealt deceitfully. Like a brook, like the streams of the brooks, they pass away;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>which are dark because of the ice, and into which the snow vanishes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When it is warm, they stop flowing; when it is hot, they dry up from their place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The paths of their journey are winding; they go into nothingness and vanish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>The wanderers of Tema have paid attention; the travelers of Sheba have looked for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>They are disappointed because they had been confident, but when they had come there they were abashed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Surely now you are nothing; you see terror and are afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Did I ever say, Bring something to me? Or, Offer a bribe for me from your wealth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Teach me, and I will keep silent; cause me to understand in what way I have erred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Right words are grievous, but what does your rebuke prove?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Do you intend to rebuke the words and the speeches of one in despair, as wind?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yea, you throw down the fatherless, and dig a pit for your friend.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now therefore, be pleased to look at me; for my face will tell if I am lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Turn back, let there be no injustice! Yea, turn back; my righteousness still stands!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern calamity?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
