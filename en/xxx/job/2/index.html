So Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking about on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Then Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil? And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you incited Me against him, to swallow him up without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Satan answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin! Yea, all that a man has he will give for his soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But stretch out Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse You to Your face!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand, but keep his soul alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah, and struck Job with malignant inflammation from the sole of his foot to the top of his head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself; and he sat down in the middle of the ashes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish ones speak. Shall we indeed receive good from God, and shall we not accept adversity? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now when JobÂ’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each one came from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. For they had made an appointment together to come and show sympathy for him, and to comfort him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when they lifted up their eyes from afar, and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voices and wept; and each one tore his robe and sprinkled dust on their heads toward the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So they sat down with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
