For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts. Thus Job did over time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, and Satan also came among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah said to Satan, From where do you come? So Satan answered Jehovah and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking about on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Jehovah said to Satan, Have you set your heart on My servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Satan answered Jehovah and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his livestock have flourished in the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>However, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and will he not curse You to Your face!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your hand; only do not stretch forth your hand upon him. So Satan went out from the presence of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the firstborn brothers house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and a messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>when the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away; indeed they have killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, The fire of God has fallen from the heavens and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, The Chaldeans formed three bands, rushed in upon the camels and took them away, yea, and killed the servants with the edge of the sword; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>While he was still speaking, another also came and said, Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the firstborn brothers house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and only I alone am escaped to tell you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell down upon the ground and prostrated himself;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and he said: Naked I have come from my mothers womb, and naked shall I return there. Jehovah has given, and Jehovah has taken away; blessed is the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with folly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
