And should a man giving lip be justified?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Should your empty talk make men hold their peace? And when you mock, should no one make you ashamed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For you have said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in Your eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But oh that God would speak, and open His lips against you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>that He would show you the secrets of wisdom! For they would double your wisdom. Know therefore that God forgets some of your iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Can you search and find out God? Can you find out the limits of the Almighty?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>They are higher than the heavens; what can you do? Deeper than Sheol; what can you know?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Their measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>If He passes by, imprisons, and gathers together, then who can repulse Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For He knows the vanity of men; He sees wickedness also. Will He not then consider it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For an empty-headed man will be wise, when a wild assÂ’s colt is born a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>If you have prepared your heart, and spread out your hands toward Him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in your tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then surely you shall lift up your face without blemish; yea, you shall be steadfast, and not fear;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>because you shall forget your misery, and remember it as waters that have passed away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and your lifetime shall arise more than the brightness of the noonday. Though you were dark, you shall be like the morning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And you shall be secure, because there is hope; yea, you shall dig around you, and rest in safety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You shall also lie down, and no one shall cause you to tremble; yea, many shall entreat your favor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and their place of escape shall perish; and their hope, as the expiring of the soul!</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
