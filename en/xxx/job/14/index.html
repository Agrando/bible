No one!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Since his days are determined, the number of his months is with You; You have appointed his limits, so that he cannot pass beyond it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Look away from him that he may rest, so like a hired man he may be satisfied with his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and its tender shoots will not cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stump dies in the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>yet at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth branches like a plant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But a strong man dies and is laid away; indeed man expires and where is he?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As water evaporates from the sea, and a river wastes away and dries up,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake nor be aroused from their sleep.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>O that You would hide me in Sheol, that You would conceal me until Your wrath is turned back, that You would appoint me a decree, and remember me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If a man dies, shall he revive? All the days of my service I will wait, until my change comes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>You shall call, and I will answer You; You shall long for the work of Your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For now You number my steps. Do you not watch over my sin?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and You cover my iniquity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But as a mountain falls and crumbles away, and as a rock is moved out of its place;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>as waters wear away stones, and as floods wash away the dust of the earth; so You destroy the hope of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>You overpower him forever, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>His sons come to honor, and he does not recognize them; they are diminished, and he does not perceive it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But his flesh will be in pain, and his soul will mourn.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
