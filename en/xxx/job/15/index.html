Or were you made before the hills?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Have you heard the counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not in us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Both the grayheaded and the aged are among us, much older than your father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Are the consolations of the Mighty God of little worth to you? Do you have secret words?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Why does your heart carry you away, and what do your eyes wink at,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>that you turn your spirit against the Mighty God, and let such words go out of your mouth?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>What is man, that he should be pure? And he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>If God puts no trust in His saints, and the heavens are not pure in His sight;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>how much more abhorrent and corrupt is man, who drinks injustice like water!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will tell you; hear me, and what I have seen I will declare,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>what wise men have told, not hiding anything received from their fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>to whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The wicked man writhes with pain all his days, and the number of years is stored up for the ruthless.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Dreadful sounds are in his ears; during peace, devastation comes upon him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>He does not believe that he will return from darkness, for a sword watches for him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He wanders about for bread, saying, where is it? He knows that the day of darkness is ready at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Adversity and distress terrify him; they overpower him, like a king ready for the attack.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he stretches out his hand against the Mighty God, and acts defiantly against the Almighty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>running with stiff neck against Him with his thick, embossed shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He has covered his face with his fatness, and made his waist heavy with fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>He dwells in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabits, which are ready to become heaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He will not be rich, nor will his wealth endure, nor shall his possessions overspread the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>He shall not depart from darkness; the flame shall dry out his branches, and by the breath of His mouth he shall be removed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Let not him who wanders about trust in vanity, for vanity shall be his recompense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine, and cast off his blossom like the olive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For the company of hypocrites shall be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>They conceive trouble and bring forth iniquity; their womb prepares deceit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
