Who has hardened himself against Him and been at peace?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He removes the mountains, and they do not know when He overturns them in His anger;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>He commands the sun, and it does not rise; He seals up the stars;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He alone spreads out the heavens, and treads upon the waves of the sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>He made the Ursa Major, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He does great things past finding out, yea, wonders without number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>If He passes by me, I do not see Him; if He moves past, I do not perceive Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>If He takes away, who can repulse Him? Who can say to Him, What are You doing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The Mighty God will not withdraw His anger; those who help the proud lie prostrate beneath Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>How then can I answer Him, and choose my words before Him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For though I had been righteous, I could not answer Him; I would beg mercy of my Judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If I had called and He answered me, I would not believe that He had heard the voice of my prayer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For He crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If it is a matter of strength, indeed He is strong; and if of justice, who will appoint my meeting?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Though I were righteous, my own mouth would condemn me; though I were perfect, it would prove me perverse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Though I were perfect, yet I do not know my soul; I despise my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>It is all one; therefore I have said, He destroys the perfect and the wicked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If the scourge slays suddenly, He mocks at the despair of the innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now my days are swifter than a runner; they flee away, they see no good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>They pass by like swift ships, like an eagle swooping on its food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face and wear a smile,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>I am afraid of all my pain; I know that You will not hold me innocent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>If I am guilty, why then do I labor in vain?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>If I wash myself with snow water, and cleanse my hands with soap,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>yet You will plunge me into the pit, and my own clothes would abhor me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For He is not a man, as I am, that I may answer Him, and that we should come together in judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nor is there any mediator between us, who may lay his hand on us both.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Let Him take His rod away from me, and do not let the dread of Him terrify me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then I would speak and not fear Him; but it is not so with me.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
