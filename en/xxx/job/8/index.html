Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>If your sons have sinned against Him, He has cast them away for their transgression.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>If you would earnestly seek the Mighty God and make your supplication to the Almighty,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>if you were pure and upright, surely now He would awake for you, and would have restored your righteous abode.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would increase abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For inquire now of the former generation, and prepare to search the fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>for we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Shall they not teach you and tell you, and utter words from their heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Can the rush grow up without a marsh?
