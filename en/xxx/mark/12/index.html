And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And at the season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that he might receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the vinedressers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And again he sent to them another servant, and at him they threw stones, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And again he sent another, and him they killed; and many others, beating some and killing some.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he also sent him to them last, saying, They will reverence my son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But those vinedressers said among themselves, This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers, and give the vineyard to others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have you not even read this Scripture: The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>this came about from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they sought to lay hold on Him, but feared the multitude, for they knew He had spoken the parable against them. So they left Him and went away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in His words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they had come, they said to Him, Teacher, we know that You are true, and care about no one; for You do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Shall we give, or shall we not give? But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius that I may see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So they brought it. And He said to them, Whose image and inscription is this? They said to Him, Caesars.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are Gods. And they marveled at Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him; and they asked Him, saying:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a mans brother dies, and leaves his wife behind, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up seed for his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife; and dying, he left no seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the second took her, and he died; nor did he leave any seed. And the third likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So the seven had her and left no seed. Last of all the woman also died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Jesus answered and said to them, Are you not therefore in error, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, how God spoke to him at the bush, saying, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly in error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, Which is the first commandment of all?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. This is the first commandment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And the second, like it, is this: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So the scribe said to Him, Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other besides Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love ones neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that no one dared question Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Therefore David himself calls Him Lord; how is He then his son? And the large crowd heard Him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He said to them in His teaching, Beware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>the chief seats in the synagogues, and the chief places at feasts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>who devour widows houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive surpassing condemnation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people threw money into the treasury. And many who were rich threw in much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make a quadrans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>So He called His disciples to Himself and said to them, Truly, I say to you that this poor widow has thrown in more than all those who have thrown into the treasury;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>for they all threw in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty threw in all that she had, her whole livelihood.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
