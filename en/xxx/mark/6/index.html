And many hearing Him were astonished, saying, Where did this Man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him, that such works of power are performed by His hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and brother of Jacob, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us? And they were offended at Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own kindred, and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And He could do no work of power there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And He marveled because of their unbelief. And He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And He called the twelve to Himself, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over unclean spirits,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff; no bag, no bread, no copper in their money belts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>but to wear sandals, and not to put on two tunics.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And He said to them, In whatever place you enter a house, stay there till you depart from that place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whoever will not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them. Truly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they went out and preached that people should repent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now King Herod heard of Him, for His name had become well known. And he said, John the Immerser has been raised from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is a prophet, or like one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when Herod heard, he said, This is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philips wife; for he had married her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore Herodias held it against him and wanted to kill him, but was not able;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then an opportune day came when Herod on his birthday made a feast for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Herodias daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>He also swore to her, Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So she went out and said to her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Immerser.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, I want you to give me on a platter at once the head of John the Immerser.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the king was exceedingly sorry; yet, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he did not want to slight her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in prison,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took away his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He said to them, Come apart by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have opportunity to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But the multitudes saw them departing, and many knew Him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Jesus, when He came out, saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the day was now far spent, His disciples came to Him and said, This is a deserted place, and already the hour is late.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages and buy themselves bread; for they have nothing to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But He answered and said to them, You give them something to eat. And they said to Him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them something to eat?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But He said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they found out they said, Five, and two fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then He commanded them to make them all sit down in groups on the green grass.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they sat down in ranks, in hundreds and in fifties.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when He had taken the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to Heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to His disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So everyone ate and was filled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and of the fish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And those who had eaten the loaves were about five thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And immediately He made His disciples get into the boat and go before Him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He sent the multitude away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And when He had sent them away, He departed into the mountain to pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea, and would have passed them by.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And when they saw Him walking on the sea, they supposed it was a ghost, and cried out;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He talked with them and said to them, Be of good courage. It is I; do not be afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And He went up into the boat to them, and the wind ceased. And they were greatly amazed in themselves beyond measure, and marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>For they did not understand about the loaves, because their heart was hardened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and drew to shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And when they came out of the boat, immediately the people recognized Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>ran through that whole surrounding region, and began to carry about on beds those who were sick to wherever they heard He was.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>And wherever He entered into villages, cities, or in the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged Him that they might just touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made well.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
