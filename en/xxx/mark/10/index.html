And multitudes came together to Him again, and as He was accustomed, He taught them again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And the Pharisees came and asked Him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? testing Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And He answered and said to them, What did Moses command you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>They said, Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Because of the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But from the beginning of the creation, God made them male and female.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and the two shall become one flesh; so then they are no longer two, but one flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Therefore what God has yoked together, let not man separate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>In the house His disciples also asked Him again about the same matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So He said to them, Whoever shall put away his wife and marry another commits adultery against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another, she commits adultery.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when Jesus saw it, He was indignant and said to them, Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Truly, I say to you, Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He took them up in His arms, put His hands on them, and blessed them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Jesus said to him, Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and your mother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he answered and said to Him, Teacher, all these things I have observed from my youth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, One thing you lack: Go your way, sell whatever you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in Heaven; and come, take up the cross, and follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But he was sad at this word, and went away sorrowful, for he had many possessions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Jesus looked around and said to His disciples, How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus answered again and said to them, Children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they were greatly astonished, saying among themselves, Who then is able to be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus looked at them and said, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Peter began to say to Him, Behold, we have left everything and followed You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So Jesus answered and said, Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, on account of Me and the gospel,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time; houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions; and in the age to come, eternal life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But many who are first will be last, and the last first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going before them; and they were amazed. And as they followed they were afraid. Then He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them the things that were about to happen to Him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death and deliver Him to the Gentiles;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and they will mock Him, and scourge Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him. And the third day He will rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Jacob and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Him, saying, Teacher, we want You to do for us whatever we ask.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He said to them, What do you want Me to do for you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>They said to Him, Grant us that we may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on Your left, in Your glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and be immersed with the immersion that I am immersed with?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>They said to Him, We are able. So Jesus said to them, You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the immersion I am immersed with you will be immersed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant with Jacob and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But Jesus called them to Himself and said to them, You know that those who seem to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And whoever of you desires to become first shall be slave of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they came to Jericho. And as He went out of Jericho with His disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the road begging.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And many warned him to be quiet; but he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>So Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. Then they called the blind man, saying to him, Be of good courage. Arise, He is calling you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And throwing aside his garment, he arose and came to Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And Jesus answered and said to him, What do you want Me to do for you? And the blind man said to Him, My Master, that I may see again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you well. And immediately he saw again and followed Jesus on the road.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
