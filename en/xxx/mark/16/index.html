You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He is risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But go, tell His disciples, and Peter, that He is going before you into Galilee; there you will see Him, as He said to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for they trembled and were astonished. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when He arose early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>She went and told those who had been with Him, as they mourned and wept.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they heard that He lives and was seen by her, they did not believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>After that, He appeared in another form to two of them as they walked and went into the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they went and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Later He appeared to the eleven as they sat at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen Him after He had been raised.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He who believes and is immersed will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was taken up into Heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the Word through the signs following. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
