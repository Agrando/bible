Hear Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no one anymore, but only Jesus with themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should tell no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man should rise from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So they kept this word to themselves, questioning what rising from the dead might be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they asked Him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And He answered and said to them, Truly, Elijah comes first and restores all things. And how it is written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But I say to you that Elijah has also come, and they did to him whatever they wished, as it is written of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when He came to the disciples, He saw a great multitude around them, and scribes disputing with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And immediately, when they saw Him, all the people were greatly amazed, and running to Him, greeted Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He questioned the scribes, What are you disputing with them?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And one of the crowd answered and said, Teacher, I brought You my son, who has a mute spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down; he foams, gnashes his teeth, and withers away. So I spoke to Your disciples, that they should cast it out, but they were not able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>He answered him and said, O unbelieving generation. How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought him to Him. And when he saw Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and he fell on the ground and wallowed, foaming.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So He asked his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And often he has thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Jesus said to him, If you are able to believe, all things are possible to him who believes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And immediately the father of the child cried out and said with tears, Lord, I believe! Help my unbelief!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When Jesus saw that the people came running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, Deaf and mute spirit, I command you, Come out of him and enter him no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the spirit cried out, convulsed him greatly, and came out of him. And he became as if dead, so that many said, He has died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And when He had come into the house, His disciples asked Him privately, Why could we not cast it out?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And He said to them, This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And they departed from there and passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For He taught His disciples and said to them, The Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him. And after He is killed, He will rise the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But they did not understand this word, and were afraid to ask Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house He asked them, What was it you disputed among yourselves on the road?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But they kept silent, for on the road they had disputed among themselves as to who was greater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And He sat down, called the twelve, and said to them, If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He took a little child and set him in the midst of them. And when He had taken him in His arms, He said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me but Him who sent Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And John answered Him, saying, Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Jesus said, Do not forbid him, for no one who does a work of power in My name will soon afterward be able to speak evil of Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For he who is not against us is on our behalf.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you belong to Christ, Truly, I say to you, He will by no means lose his reward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it is better for him if a millstone is hung around his neck, and he be thrown into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>If your hand makes you stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having two hands, to go to Gehenna, into the fire that shall never be quenched;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And if your foot makes you stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame, rather than having two feet, to be cast into Gehenna, into the fire that shall never be quenched;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And if your eye makes you stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into the fire of Gehenna;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>For everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Salt is good, but if the salt loses its saltiness, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
