And a great multitude was gathered to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole multitude was on the land facing the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And He taught them many things by parables, and said to them in His teaching:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Listen. Behold, a sower went out to sow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and devoured it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But when the sun was up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And some seed fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But other seed fell on good ground and yielded fruit that sprang up, increased and produced: one thirtyfold, one sixty, and one a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said to them, He who has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And He said to them, To you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things are in parables,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand; lest they should convert, and their sins be forgiven them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He said to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all parables?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The sower sows the Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And these are the ones by the wayside where the Word is sown: When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who, when they hear the Word, immediately receive it with joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and they have no root in themselves, and so endure only for a time. Afterward, when affliction or persecution arises on account of the Word, immediately they stumble.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And these are the ones sown among thorns; they are the ones who hear the Word,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things entering in choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the Word, receive it, and bear fruit: one thirtyfold, one sixty, and one a hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And He said to them, Is a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but what it will come to light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For whoever has, to him more will be given; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He said, The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and should sleep and rise, night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For the earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But when the fruit yields, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And He said, To what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we compare it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>It is like a grain of mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on earth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces large branches, so that the birds of the air are able to nest under its shade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with many such parables He spoke the Word to them as they were able to hear it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But He did not speak to them without a parable. And when they were alone, He explained all things to His disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, Let us cross over to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when they had sent away the multitude, they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Be silent! Be muzzled! And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And He said to them, Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, Who can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
