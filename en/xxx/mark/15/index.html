He answered and said to him, It is as you say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, Do You answer nothing? Behold how many things they witness against You!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them, whomever they asked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And there was one named Barabbas, who was in bonds with his fellow rebels; they had committed murder in the insurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do just as he had always done for them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For he knew that the chief priests had delivered Him up because of envy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Pilate answered and said to them again, What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they cried out again, Crucify Him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out all the more, Crucify Him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Pilate, intending to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged Him, to be crucified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they clothed Him with purple; and they wove a crown of thorns, put it on Him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and began to salute Him, Hail, King of the Jews!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him; and bending the knee, they bowed to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they gave Him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And when they crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots for them to determine what every man should take.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the inscription of His accusation was written above: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they also crucified two robbers with Him, one on His right and the other on His left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, And He was numbered with the transgressors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>save Yourself, and come down from the cross!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking among themselves with the scribes, said, He saved others, but He is not able to save Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is translated, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And some of those who stood by, when they heard that, said, Behold, He is calling for Elijah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And someone ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to Him to drink, saying, Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to take Him down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when the centurion, who stood opposite Him, saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, Truly this Man was the Son of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jacob the Less and of Joses, and Salome,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>who also followed Him and ministered to Him when He was in Galilee, and many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Now when evening had come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming, boldly went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Pilate marveled that He had already died; and summoning the centurion, he asked him if He had been dead for awhile.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And he bought fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses observed where He was laid.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
