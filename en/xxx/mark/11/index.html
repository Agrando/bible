Loose it and bring it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And if anyone says to you, Why do you do this? say, The Lord has need of it, and immediately he will send it here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door outside on the street, and they loosed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But some of those who stood there said to them, What are you doing, loosing the colt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And they spoke to them just as Jesus had commanded. So they let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and He sat on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And many spread their clothes on the road, and others cut down leafy branches from the trees and spread them on the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who went before and those who followed cried out, saying: Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Blessed is the kingdom of our father David that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the Highest!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple. So when He had looked around at all things, as the hour was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the next day, when they had come out from Bethany, He was hungry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And seeing from afar a fig tree having leaves, He went to see if perhaps He would find something on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And answering Jesus said to it, Let no one eat fruit from you ever again. And His disciples heard it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So they came to Jerusalem. And Jesus went into the temple and began to drive out those who bought and sold in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those who sold doves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And He would not allow anyone to carry any vessel through the temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And He taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations? But you have made it a den of thieves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the crowd was astonished at His doctrine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when evening had come, He went out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Peter, remembering, said to Him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which You cursed has withered away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Have faith in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, Be removed and be cast into the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will be done, it will be to him, whatever he says.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Therefore I say to you, Everything whatever you ask when you pray, believe that you receive, and it will be to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive, that your Father in Heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in Heaven forgive your trespasses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they said to Him, By what authority do You do these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one question, and answer Me; and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The immersion of John; was it from Heaven or from men? Answer Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From Heaven, He will say, Why then did you not believe him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But if we say, From men; they feared the people, for all counted John to have truly been a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So they answered and said to Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus answered and said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
