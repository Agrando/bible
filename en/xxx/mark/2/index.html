And He preached the Word to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had dug through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins except for One, God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, Why do you reason these things in your hearts?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Which is easier: To say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, take up your bed and walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins; He said to the paralytic,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say to you, Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And as He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, Follow Me. So he arose and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it happened, as He was dining in LeviÂ’s house, that many tax collectors and sinners also sat together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when the scribes and Pharisees saw Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, they said to His disciples, How is it that He eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When Jesus heard it, He said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. And they came and said to Him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; or else the new piece pulls away from the old, and the tear is made worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now it happened that He went through the grainfields on the Sabbath; and as they went His disciples began to pluck the heads of grain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Pharisees said to Him, Behold, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But He said to them, Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>how he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the Bread of Presentation, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave to those who were with him?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And He said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
