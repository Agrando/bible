And they said, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>So He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. And He took the seven loaves and gave thanks, broke them and gave them to His disciples to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they also had a few small fish; and having blessed them, He said to set them also before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So they ate and were filled, and they took up seven baskets of leftover fragments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who had eaten were about four thousand. And He sent them away,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and immediately got into the boat with His disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the Pharisees came out and began to dispute with Him, seeking from Him a sign from Heaven, testing Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But He sighed deeply in His spirit, and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, As if a sign will be given to this generation!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He left them, and getting into the boat again, departed to the other side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, and they did not have more than one loaf with them in the boat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And He charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Jesus, knowing, said to them, Why do you reason because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive nor understand? Is your heart still hardened?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? They said to Him, Twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also, when I broke the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? And they said, Seven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So He said to them, How is it you do not understand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and begged Him to touch him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he looked up and said, I see men like trees, walking.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then He sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell anyone in the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So they answered, John the Immerser; but some say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said to Him, You are the Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And He charged them that they should tell no one about Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And He began to teach them that it is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days to rise again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And He spoke this word openly. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But when He had turned around and looked at His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when He had called the people to Himself, with His disciples also, He said to them, Whoever desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospelÂ’s will save it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him the Son of Man also will be ashamed when He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
