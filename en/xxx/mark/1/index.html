Repent, and believe in the gospel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus said to them, Come after Me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they immediately left their nets and followed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when He had gone a little farther from there, He saw Jacob the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And immediately He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and taught.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they were astonished at His doctrine, for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit. And he cried out,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are; the Holy One of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be quiet, and come out of him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the unclean spirit had convulsed him and cried out with a loud voice, he came out of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And immediately His fame spread throughout all the region around Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And as soon as they had come out of the synagogue, they entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with Jacob and John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But Simons wifes mother lay sick with a fever, and at once they told Him about her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So He came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and immediately the fever left her. And she served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And at evening, when the sun had set, they brought to Him all who were sick and those who were demon-possessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a solitary place; and there prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Simon and those who were with Him followed after Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And when they found Him, they said to Him, Everyone is looking for You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But He said to them, Let us go into the neighboring towns, that I may preach there also, because for this purpose I have come forth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Now a leper came to Him, begging Him, kneeling down to Him and saying to Him, If You are willing, You can make me clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus, moved with compassion, stretched out His hand and touched him, and said to him, I am willing; be made clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And as soon as He had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He strictly warned him and sent him away at once,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing those things which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>However, he went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread the matter, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter the city, but was outside in deserted places; and they came to Him from every direction.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
