But they kept silent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when He had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the Pharisees went out and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against Him, how they might destroy Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things He was doing, came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said to His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, that they might not press upon Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For He healed many, such that, as many as had plagues lunged upon Him in order to touch Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, You are the Son of God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them forth to preach,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jacob the son of Zebedee and John the brother of Jacob, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Jacob the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Canaanite;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. And they went into a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the multitude came together again, so that they were not even able to eat bread.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when His next of kin heard about this, they went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, He is beside Himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, by the ruler of the demons He casts out demons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So He called them to Himself and said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And if a house is divided against itself, that house is not able to stand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>No one can enter a strong manÂ’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. And then he will plunder his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Truly, I say to you, All sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may blaspheme;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has remission, but is subject to eternal damnation;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>because they said, He has an unclean spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are seeking You outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But He answered them, saying, Who is My mother, or My brothers?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He looked around in a circle at those who sat around Him, and said, Behold My mother and My brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
