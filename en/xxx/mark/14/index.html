And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take Him by deceit and put Him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>But they said, Not during the Feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly ointment of spikenard. And she broke the flask and poured it on His head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But there were some who were indignant within themselves, and said, Why was this ointment wasted?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Jesus said, Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work toward Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For you have the poor with you always, and whenever you wish you may do them good; but you do not always have Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>She has done what she was in a position to do. She has come beforehand to anoint My body for burial.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Truly, I say to you, Wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to deliver Him to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. So he sought how he might conveniently betray Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover, His disciples said to Him, Where do You want us to go and prepare, that You may eat the Passover?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And He sent out two of His disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And wherever he goes in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he will show you a large upper room, furnished and prepared; make ready for us there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found it just as He had said to them; and they prepared the Passover.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And in the evening He came with the twelve.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now as they sat and ate, Jesus said, Truly, I say to you, one of you who eats with Me will betray Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they began to be grieved, and to say to Him one by one, Surely not me? And another said, Surely not me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He answered and said to them, It is one of the twelve, who dips with Me in the dish.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The Son of Man truly goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, Take, eat; this is My body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And He took the cup, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And He said to them, This is My blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Truly, I say to you, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jesus said to them, All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But after I have been raised, I will go before you into Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Peter said to Him, Even if all are made to stumble, yet not I.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus said to him, Truly, I say to you that today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But he spoke more vehemently, If I need to die with You, I will not deny You! And they all said likewise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane; and He said to His disciples, Sit here while I pray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He took Peter, Jacob, and John with Him, and He began to be in dread and deeply distressed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And He went a little farther, and fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not strong enough to watch one hour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Watch and pray, that you not enter into temptation. The spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And again He went away and prayed, and spoke the same words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And when He returned, He found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He came the third time and said to them, Sleep on now and take your rest. It is enough. The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being delivered into the hands of sinners.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Rise up, let us be going. Behold, the one betraying Me is at hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And His betrayer had given them a signal, saying, Whomever I kiss, it is He; seize Him and lead Him away safely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And as soon as He had come, immediately he went up to Him and said to Him, Rabbi, Rabbi! and kissed Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And they laid their hands on Him and took Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And Jesus answered and said to them, Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>I was with you daily in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>And they all forsook Him and fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>And a certain young man followed Him, having a linen cloth thrown around his naked body. And the young men laid hold of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>And Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>And the chief priests and all the council sought testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but found none.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>For many bore false witness against Him, but their testimonies were not the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>And some rose up and bore false witness against Him, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>We heard Him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And neither in this was their testimony the same.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, saying, Do You answer nothing? What is it these men witness against You?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="61">61</a>But He kept silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest questioned Him, saying to Him, Are You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="62">62</a>Jesus said, I AM. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="63">63</a>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, What further need do we have of witnesses?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="64">64</a>You have heard the blasphemy! What does it appear to you? And they all condemned Him to be worthy of death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="65">65</a>And some began to spit on Him, and to cover His face, and to beat Him with the fist, and to say to Him, Prophesy! And the officers struck Him with slaps.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="66">66</a>Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="67">67</a>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, You also were with Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="68">68</a>But he denied it, saying, I neither know nor understand what you are saying. And he went out on the porch, and a rooster crowed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="69">69</a>And the servant girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, This is one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="70">70</a>And he denied it again. And a little later those who stood by said to Peter again, Surely you are one of them; for you are a Galilean, and your speech agrees.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="71">71</a>Then he began to curse and swear, I do not know this man of whom you speak!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="72">72</a>And a second time the rooster crowed. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times. And when he thought on it, he wept.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
