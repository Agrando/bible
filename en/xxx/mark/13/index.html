Not one stone shall be left upon another, that shall not be thrown down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew questioned Him privately,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Jesus, answering them, began to say: Take heed that no one leads you astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For many will come in My name, saying, I AM, and will lead many astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled; for it is necessary for such things to come about, but the end is not yet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginnings of travail.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But take heed to yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before rulers and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But when they lead you away and deliver you up, do not be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will speak. But whatever is given you in that hour, speak that; for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And you will be hated by everyone on account of My name. But he who endures to the end shall be kept safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And pray that your flight may not be in winter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For in those days there will be affliction, such as has not been since the beginning of the creation which God created until this time, nor ever shall be.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be kept safe alive; but because of the elect, whom He chose, He has shortened the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ; or, Look, He is there; do not believe it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For false christs and false prophets will arise and show signs and wonders to cause, if possible, even the elect to go astray.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But take heed; behold, I have foretold you all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But in those days, after that affliction, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>the stars of heaven will be falling, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And then He will send His angels, and gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest part of earth to the farthest part of heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So you also, when you see these things happening, know that it is near; at the doors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Truly, I say to you, This generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>But of that day and hour no one knows, not the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, except the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Take heed, watch and pray; for you do not know when the time is.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>It is like a man going to a far country, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, and to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming; in the evening, at midnight, at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>that, coming suddenly, he not find you sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
