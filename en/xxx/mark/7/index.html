And there are many other things which they have received and hold, like the dipping of cups, pitchers, copper vessels, and couches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He answered and said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far away from Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And in vain they revere Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men; the dipping of pitchers and cups, and many other such things you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He said to them, Full well you set aside the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For Moses said, Honor your father and your mother; and, He who curses father or mother, let him die the death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But you say, If a man says to his father or mother, Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban (that is, a gift),</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>then you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>making the Word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when He had called all the multitude to Himself, He said to them, Hear Me, everyone, and understand:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>There is nothing that enters a man from outside which is able to defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when He had entered a house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So He said to them, Are you thus without understanding also? Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and goes out as waste? Thus He was purifying all foods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And He said, What comes out of a man, that defiles a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual perversions, murders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>All these evil things come from within and defile a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>From there He arose and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And He entered a house and wanted no one to know it, but He could not be hidden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and fell at His feet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by birth, and she begged Him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jesus said to her, Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the childrens bread and throw it to the little dogs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And she answered and said to Him, Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs under the table eat from the childrens crumbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then He said to her, For this saying go your way; the demon has gone out of your daughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when she had come to her house, she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And again, departing from the region of Tyre and Sidon, He came through the middle of the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they brought to Him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they begged Him to put His hand on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And He took him aside from the multitude, and put His fingers in his ears, and He spat and touched his tongue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then, looking up to Heaven, He sighed, and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke correctly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And He commanded them that they should tell no one; but the more He commanded them, the more widely they proclaimed it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
