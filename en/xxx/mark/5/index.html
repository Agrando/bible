And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; neither could anyone tame him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And continually, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and did homage to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he cried out with a loud voice and said, What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God that You do not torment me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For He said to him, Come out of the man, unclean spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And He asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion; for we are many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He also begged Him earnestly that He would not send them out of the country.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now a large herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So all the demons begged Him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Jesus immediately gave them permission. And the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two thousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and drowned in the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And those who fed the swine fled, and they told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they came to Jesus, and saw the one who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And those who saw it told them how it happened to him who had been demon-possessed, and about the swine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they began to beg Him to depart from their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when He got into the boat, he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and everyone marveled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to Him; and He was by the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and begged Him earnestly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>When she heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For she said, If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was healed of the plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, Who touched My clothes?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But His disciples said to Him, You see the multitude thronging You, and do You say, Who touched Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And He looked around to see her who had done this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened in her, came and fell down before Him and told Him all the truth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And He said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your plague.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogueÂ’s house who said, Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not be afraid; only believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, Jacob, and John the brother of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who wept and wailed loudly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when He came in, He said to them, Why do you make this commotion and weep? The child has not died, but is sleeping.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him, and entered where the child was lying.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And He took the child by the hand, and said to her, Talitha, koumi, which is translated, Little girl, I say to you, Arise.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years of age. And they were beside themselves with great amazement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And He commanded them strictly that no one should know it, and said that something should be given to her to eat.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
