From now on I will go to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he departed from there and entered the house of a certain man named Justus, one who revered God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing and believing, were immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the Word of God among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>saying, This fellow persuades men to revere God contrary to the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked crimes, O Jews, there would be reason why I should bear with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if it is a question of words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves; for I do not want to be a judge of such matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he drove them from the judgment seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. But Gallio took no notice of these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>So Paul still remained a good while. Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He had his hair cut at Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When they asked him to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but took leave of them, saying, I must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing. And he sailed from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>After he had spent some time there, he departed and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, though he knew only the immersion of John.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he was minded to cross to Achaia, the brethren wrote, encouraging the disciples to receive him; and when he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
