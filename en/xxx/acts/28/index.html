But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>In that region there were lands of the chief of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and lodged us for three days hospitably.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So when this was done, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>They also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they provided such things as were necessary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>After three months we sailed in an Alexandrian ship whose figurehead was the Twin Brothers, which had wintered at the island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>From there we circled round and came to Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew; and the next day we came to Puteoli,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>where we found brethren, and were entreated to stay with them seven days. And thus we went toward Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass after three days that Paul called those being chief of the Jews together. So when they had come together, he said to them: Men and brethren, though I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>who, when they had examined me, wanted to let me go, because there was no cause for putting me to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see you and speak with you, because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who came reported or spoken any evil of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But we desire to hear from you what you think; for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So when they did not agree among themselves, they were dismissed after Paul had said one word: The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>saying, Go to this people and say: Hearing you will hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you will see, and not perceive;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>for the heart of this people has grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, that they should not see with their eyes nor hear with their ears, that they should not understand with their hearts and turn, and I should heal them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had much discussion among themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, without hindrance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
