Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the manÂ’s house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house, who said to him, Send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>who will tell you words by which you and all your household will be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then I remembered the Word of the Lord, how He said, John indeed immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us who believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to prevent God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When they heard these things they kept silent; and they glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance unto life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now those who were scattered after the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the Word to no one but the Jews only.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they had come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then news of these things came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go as far as Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced, and encouraged them all that with purpose of heart they should continue with the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then one of them, named Agabus, stood up and gave a sign through the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine throughout all the world, which also happened in the days of Claudius Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brethren dwelling in Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This they also did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
