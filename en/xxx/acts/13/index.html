They also had John as their assistant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now when they had gone through the island to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man called for Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) withstood them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Saul, who also is called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and said, O full of all deceit and all mischief, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the right ways of the Lord?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, lo, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And immediately a dark mist fell on him, and he went around seeking someone to lead him by the hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had been done, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to the people, speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He brought them out of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now for a time of about forty years He put up with their ways in the wilderness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land to them by allotment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>After that He gave them judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He bore witness and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>From this manÂ’s seed, according to promise, God raised up for Israel a Savior, Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>when John had first preached, before His coming on the scene, an immersion of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Who do you think I am? I am not He. But behold, there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Men and brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the Word of this salvation is sent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled them in condemning Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And though they found no cause of death in Him, they asked Pilate that He should be done away with.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But God raised Him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we preach the gospel to you; the promise which was made to the fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm: You are My Son, today I have begotten You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken thus: I will give you the holy and faithful promises of David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Therefore He also says in another place: You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw corruption;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>but He whom God raised up saw no corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through this One is preached to you the remission of sins;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and by Him everyone who believes is justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the Law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Beware therefore, that what has been spoken in the Prophets may not come upon you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Behold, you despisers, marvel and perish. For I work a work in your days, a work which you will by no means believe, though one were to declare it to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And on the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the Word of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they opposed the things spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, It was necessary that the Word of God should be spoken to you first; but since you thrust it away, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>For thus the Lord has commanded us: I have set you as a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>Now when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the Word of the Lord. And as many as had been appointed unto eternal life believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>And the Word of the Lord was carried throughout all the region.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>But the Jews stirred up the devout and influential women and the chief men of the city, raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their borders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
