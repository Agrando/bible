At that time a great persecution arose against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering every house, dragging off men and women, committing them to prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore those who were scattered went everywhere preaching the Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the multitudes with one accord heeded the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the many signs which he did.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there was great joy in that city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But there was a certain man called Simon, who previously used sorcery in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And they heeded him because he had amazed them with his sorceries for a long time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Simon himself also believed; and when he was immersed he continued with Philip, and was amazed, seeing the works of power and signs which were done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the Word of God, they sent Peter and John to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For as yet He had not fallen on any of them. They had only been immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostlesÂ’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>saying, Give me this authority also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you thought that the gift of God could be purchased with money!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>You have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your heart is not upright before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For I see that you are in bitter wickedness and bound by unrighteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then Simon answered and said, Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So when they had testified and preached the Word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise and go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is desert.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So he arose and went. And behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of high office under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge of all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem to do homage,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>was returning. And sitting in his chariot, he was reading Isaiah the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near and join yourself to this chariot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Philip ran to him, and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, Do you understand what you are reading?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And he said, How can I, unless someone guides me? And he summoned Philip to come up and sit with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>The place in the Scripture which he read was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, so He opened not His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>In His humiliation His judgment was taken away, and who will declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>So the eunuch answered Philip and said, I ask you, of whom does the prophet say this, of himself or of some other man?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now as they went down the road, they came upon some water. And the eunuch said, See, here is water. What prevents me from being immersed?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, it is lawful. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he immersed him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>But Philip was found at Azotus. And passing through, he preached in all the cities till he came to Caesarea.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
