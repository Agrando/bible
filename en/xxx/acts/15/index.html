and they brought great joy to all the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the Law of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up and said to them: Men and brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the Word of the gospel and believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But we believe through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved, in the same manner as they.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul recounting how many signs and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after they had become silent, Jacob answered, saying, Men and brethren, listen to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Simon has declared how God at the first looked upon the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>After this I will return and will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen down; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will set it up;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>so that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, even all the Gentiles who are called by My name, says the Lord who does all these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Known to God from eternity are all His works.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but that we write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols, from sexual perversion, from things strangled, and from blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>They wrote this letter by them: The apostles, the elders, and the brethren, to the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, You must be circumcised and keep the Law; to whom we gave no such commandment;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>men who have given their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual perversion. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So when they were sent away, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And after they had stayed there for a time, they were sent back with greetings from the brethren to the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the Word of the Lord, with many others also.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us now go back and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the Word of the Lord, and see how they are holding on.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now Barnabas was determined to take with them John called Mark.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>But Paul insisted that they should not take with them the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
