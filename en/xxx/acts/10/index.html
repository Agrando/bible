So he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. He will tell you what you need to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when the angel who spoke to him had departed, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So when he had explained all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The next day, as they went on their journey and drew near the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And he became very hungry and wanted to eat; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and saw heaven opened and an object like a great sheet bound at the four corners, descending to him and let down to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>In it were all kinds of four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, creeping things, and birds of the air.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And a voice came to him, Arise, Peter; kill and eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter said, By no means, Lord! For I have never eaten anything common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the voice spoke to him again the second time, What God has cleansed do not consider unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This was done three times. And the object was taken up into heaven again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now while Peter was perplexed within himself what this vision which he had seen meant, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for SimonÂ’s house, and stood before the gate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>While Peter pondered concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are seeking you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Arise therefore, go down and go with them without hesitating; for I have sent them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then Peter went down to the men who had been sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek. For what reason are you here?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, one who fears God and has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then he invited them in and lodged them. And on the next day Peter went away with them, and some brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the following day they entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his relatives and close friends.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and did homage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up; I myself am also a man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And as he talked with him, he went in and found many who had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then he said to them, You know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to keep company with or go to one of another nation. But God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms are remembered in the sight of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, whose surname is Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. When he comes, he will speak to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So I sent to you immediately, and you have done well to come. Now therefore, we are all present before God, to hear all the things commanded you by God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then Peter opened his mouth and said: In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>The Word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace through Jesus Christ (He is Lord of all);</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>that Word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the immersion which John preached:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they did away with, hanging Him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>God raised Him up on the third day, and gave to Him to become manifest,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, even to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And He commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God to be Judge of the living and the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>To Him all the prophets witness that, through His name, everyone believing into Him will receive remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon each one who heard the Word.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And those of the circumcision who were believers, as many as came with Peter, were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had also been poured out on the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay a few days.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
