And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you put this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and breathed his last. So great fear came upon all those who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the young men arose and wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now it was about three hours later when his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Peter answered her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? She said, Yes, for so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her out, buried her by her husband.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So great fear came upon all the church and upon all who heard these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And through the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were done among the people. And they were all with one accord in Solomons Porch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Moreover none of the rest dared join them, but the people magnified them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And more believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>so that they brought the sick out into the streets and laid them on beds and mattresses, that even if the shadow of Peter came passing by, it might overshadow some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also a multitude gathered from the surrounding cities to Jerusalem, bringing sick people and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with zeal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But at night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the Words of this Life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they heard that, they entered the temple early in the morning and taught. But the high priest and those with him came and called the council together, with all the elders of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But when the officers came and did not find them in the prison, they returned and reported,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>saying, Indeed we found the prison shut securely, and the guards standing outside before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one inside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now when the high priest, the temple commander, and the chief priests heard these things, they were perplexed as to whatever would become of this.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then one came and reported to them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the commander went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they feared the people, that they might not be stoned.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they had brought them, they stood them before the council. And the high priest asked them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>saying, Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Mans blood upon us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But Peter and the other apostles answered and said: We ought to obey God rather than men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you laid hands on, hanging Him on a tree.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Savior, to give to Israel repentance and remission of sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And we are His witnesses of these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>When they heard this, they were cut to the heart and took counsel to do away with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then one in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law highly esteemed by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And he said to them: Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do regarding these men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody. A number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days of the census, and drew away many people after him. He also perished, and all who obeyed him were dispersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if this counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it; lest you even be found to fight against God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they agreed with him, and when they had summoned the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>So they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for His name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
