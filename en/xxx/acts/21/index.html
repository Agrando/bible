They told Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when we had come to the end of those days, we departed and went on our way; and they all accompanied us, with women and children, till we were out of the city. And we knelt down on the shore and prayed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When we had taken our leave of one another, we boarded the ship, and they returned home.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had finished our voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, greeted the brethren, and stayed with them one day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>On the next day we who were Pauls companions departed and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And as we stayed many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And when he had come to us, he took Pauls waistband, binding his own hands and feet, and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this waistband, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when we heard these things, both we and those from that place begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Paul answered, What do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So when he would not be persuaded, we kept quiet, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And after those days we packed and went up to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them Mnason, a certain Cypriot, one of the original disciples, with whom we were to lodge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And on the following day Paul went in with us to Jacob, and all the elders were present.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when he had greeted them, he related one by one the things which God had worked among the Gentiles through his ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord. And they said to him, You see, brother, how many countless Jews there are who believe, and they also are all zealous for the Law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>but they have been informed about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have a vow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Take them and be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads, and that all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning you are nothing, but that you yourself also walk orderly and keep the Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and concluded that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual perversion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having been purified with them, entered the temple to declare the fulfillment of the days of purification, until an offering should be brought for each one of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, the Law, and this place; and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And all the city was in a commotion; and the people ran together, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Now as they were seeking to kill him, news came to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the commander came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and he asked who he was and what he had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And some among the multitude cried one thing and some another. So when he could not ascertain the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be led away into the barracks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he reached the stairs, it happened that he was carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, Away with him!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, May I speak to you? He replied, Do you speak Greek?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up trouble and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But Paul said, I am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; and I ask you, allow me to speak to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew dialect, saying,</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
