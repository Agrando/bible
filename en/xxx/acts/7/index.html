And from there, when his father was dead, He moved him to this land in which you now dwell.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And God gave him no inheritance in it, not even enough to set his foot on. But even when Abraham had no child, He promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But God spoke in this way: that his seed would dwell in a foreign land, and that they would bring them into bondage and oppress them four hundred years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the nation to whom they will be in bondage I will judge, said God, and after that they shall come out and serve Me in this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot the twelve patriarchs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the patriarchs, becoming envious, sold Joseph into Egypt. But God was with him</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now a famine and great distress came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and our fathers found no food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Josephs kindred became known to Pharaoh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob and all his relatives to him, seventy-five souls.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, he and our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham bought for a price of money from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But when the time of the promise drew near which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>till another king arose who did not know Joseph.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This man dealt craftily with our people, and oppressed our forefathers, making them cast out their babies, so that they might not live.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>At this time Moses was born, and was beautiful to God; and he was brought up in his fathers house for three months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when he was set out, Pharaohs daughter took him away and brought him up as her own son.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Now when he was forty years old, it came into his heart to look after his brethren, the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended and avenged him who was oppressed, and struck down the Egyptian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For he supposed that his brethren would have understood that God would deliver them by his hand, but they did not understand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the next day he appeared to two of them as they were fighting, and urged them to peace, saying, Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong one another?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he who did his neighbor wrong pushed him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Do you not want to do away with me in the same way you did the Egyptian yesterday?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then, at this saying, Moses fled and became an alien in the land of Midian, where he had two sons.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when forty years had passed, the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>When Moses saw it, he marveled at the sight; and as he drew near to observe, the voice of the Lord came to him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>I am the God of your fathers; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses becoming terrified, dared not look.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then the Lord said to him, Loosen the sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I have given attention to see the affliction of My people who are in Egypt; I have heard their groaning and have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>This Moses whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? is the one God sent to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>He led them out, after he had shown wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>This is that Moses who said to the children of Israel, The Lord your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brethren. Him you shall hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers, the one who received the living Words to give to us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>whom our fathers did not desire to obey, but thrust him away. And in their hearts they turned back to Egypt,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And they made a calf in those days, led a sacrifice up to the idol, and made merry in the works of their own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then God turned and gave them over to serve the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the Prophets: Did you offer Me slaughtered animals and sacrifices during forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>You also took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, images which you made to do homage; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Our fathers had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, as He appointed, instructing Moses to make it according to the pattern that he had seen,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>which our fathers, having received it in turn, also brought with Joshua into the land possessed by the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>who found favor before God and asked to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>But Solomon built Him a house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>However, the Most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as the prophet says:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Heaven is My throne, and earth is My footstool. What house will you build for Me? says the Lord, or what is the place of My rest?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>Has My hand not made all these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>You stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always oppose the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they, who received the Law by the command of angels and did not keep it, killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="53">53</a>of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="54">54</a>When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="55">55</a>But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into Heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="56">56</a>and said, Behold, I see the Heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="57">57</a>Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and ran at him with one accord;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="58">58</a>and they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid aside their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="59">59</a>And they stoned Stephen as he was invoking and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="60">60</a>And he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not charge them with this sin. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
