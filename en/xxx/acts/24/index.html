These made declarations to the governor against Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And when he was called upon, Tertullus began his accusation, saying: Seeing that through you we enjoy great peace, and prosperity is being brought to this nation by your providence,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>we accept it always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Nevertheless, not to be tedious to you any further, I entreat you to hear, by your fairness, a few words from us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>For we have found this man pestilent, a mover of insurrection among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He even tried to profane the temple, and we seized him, and were determined to judge him according to our law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the commander Lysias came by and with great violence took him out of our hands,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>commanding his accusers to come to you. By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Jews also assented, alleging that these things were so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: Inasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully make my defense,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to do homage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, neither in the synagogues nor throughout the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I serve the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>I have hope in God, which they themselves also admit, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience that is blameless toward God and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with a crowd nor with tumult.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>They ought to have been here before you to accuse if they had anything against me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Or else let these themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>unless it is for this one statement which I cried out while standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of the Way, he postponed judgment and said, When Lysias the commander comes down, I will examine your case.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
