And he leaped and walked.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now when the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, The gods have come down to us, becoming like men!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, determined to sacrifice with the multitudes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, they tore their clothes and rushed in among the multitude, crying out</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and saying, Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, and preach to you that you should turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>who in past generations allowed all nations to go in their own ways.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, doing good, giving us rain from the heavens and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to have died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must enter the kingdom of God through many afflictions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they committed them to the Lord into whom they believed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And after they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when they had preached the Word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So they stayed there not a little time with the disciples.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
