Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the next day we landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him liberty to go to his friends and receive care.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And when we had set sail from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra of Lycia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous because the fast was already past, Paul exhorted them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>saying, Men, I perceive that this voyage will end with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, and winter there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, raising anchor, they sailed close by Crete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But not long after, a tempestuous wind arose, called Euroclydon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let her be carried along.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And running under the shelter of an island called Clauda, we secured the boat with difficulty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing lest they should run aground on the quicksands, they struck sail and so were driven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next day they lightened the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>On the third day we threw the ships tackle overboard with our own hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest beat on us, all hope that we would be saved was then taken away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But after long abstinence from food, then Paul stood in the midst of them and said, Men, you should have heeded me, and not have sailed from Crete and incurred this injury and loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now I urge you to be of good cheer, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For there stood by me this night an angel of God, to whom I belong and whom I serve,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>saying, Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Therefore be of good cheer, men, for I believe God, that it will be just as it was told me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>However, we must fall on a certain island.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors sensed that they were drawing near some land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and wished for day to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let it fall off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And as day was about to dawn, Paul begged them all to take food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, and eaten nothing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, because not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken it he began to eat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then they all became more encouraged, and also took food themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six souls on the ship.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And when it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a certain bay with a beach, onto which they purposed to run the ship if they were able.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, meanwhile loosing the rudder bands; and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind and made for shore.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>But striking a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And the soldiers purpose was to kill the prisoners, that not any of them should swim away and escape.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and for the rest to go, some on boards and some on parts of the ship. And so it was that they all escaped safely to land.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
