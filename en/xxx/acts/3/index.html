Or why do you gaze on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Son Jesus, whom you delivered up and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had determined to set Him free.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But you denied the Holy and Just One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and killed the Prince of Life, whom God raised up from the dead, of which we are witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And His Name, by faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yet now, brethren, I know that you did it in ignorance, as did also your rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But those things which God foretold through the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and that He may send Jesus Christ, who was preached to you before,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>whom Heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God has spoken through the mouth of all His holy prophets since the past ages.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For Moses truly said to the fathers, The Lord your God will raise up to you a Prophet like me from among your brethren. You shall hear Him in all things, whatever He says to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and those who follow, as many as have spoken, have also foretold these days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your Seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Having raised up His Son Jesus, God sent Him to you first, to bless you in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
