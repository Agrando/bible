Then he said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the strictness of our fathersÂ’ Law, and was zealous toward God as you all are today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the council of the elders, from whom I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring even those who were there, bound, to Jerusalem to be punished.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now it happened, as I journeyed and came near Damascus at about noon, suddenly a great light from Heaven shone around me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So I answered, Who are You, Sir? And He said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they did not hear the words uttered by Him who spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Arise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all things which are appointed for you to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And since I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the Law, having a good testimony with all the Jews who dwelt there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>came to me; and he stood and said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And at that same instant I looked up at him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you that you should know His will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice out of His mouth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For you will be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And now why are you waiting? Arise and be immersed, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it happened, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and saw Him saying to me, Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So I said, Lord, they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those believing on You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, consenting to his death, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Then He said to me, Depart, for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And they listened to him until this word, and then they raised their voices and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth, for he is not fit to live!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then, as they cried out and tore off their clothes and threw dust into the air,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined by scourging, so that he might know for what reason they shouted so against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and not condemned by trial?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the centurion heard that, he went and told the commander, saying, Take heed what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the commander came and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, Yes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the commander answered, With a large sum I obtained this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was free born.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then immediately those who were about to examine him stood away from him; and the commander was also afraid after he fully knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>The next day, because he wanted to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down and set him before them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
