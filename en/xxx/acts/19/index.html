And finding some disciples</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>he said to them, Since you believe, did you receive the Holy Spirit? And they said to him, We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>So he said to them, Into what then were you immersed? And they said, Into Johns immersion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Then Paul said, John indeed immersed with an immersion of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When they heard this, they were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now the men were about twelve in all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But when some were hardened and did not obey, but spoke evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of a certain Tyrannus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this continued for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the Word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now God worked unusual works of power through the hands of Paul,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out from them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, We command you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but who are you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them and subdued them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This became known to all, both Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And many who had believed came confessing and telling their deeds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of everyone. And they counted up the value of them, and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So the Word of the Lord grew mightily and was powerful.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>When these things were completed, Paul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>So he sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And about that time there was no small disturbance about the Way;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>for a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no small profit to the craftsmen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>He assembled them with the workers of similar occupation, and said: Men, you know that we have our wealth by this trade.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Moreover you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be despised and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world revere.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Now when they heard this, they were full of anger and cried out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>So the whole city was filled with confusion, and rushed into the theater with one accord, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Pauls travel companions.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And when Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not allow him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then some of the officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theater.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and wanted to make his defense to the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>But when they found out that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: Men of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple guardian of the great goddess Artemis, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>But if you have any other inquiry to make, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>For we are in danger of being accused of insurrection concerning today, there being no reason which we may give to account for this riot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
