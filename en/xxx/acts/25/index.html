And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And when he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around and brought many serious complaints against Paul, which they were not able to prove.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Defending himself he said, Neither against the Law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I trespassed in anything at all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be judged before me concerning these things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Paul said, I stand at Caesars judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For if I have done wrong, or have committed anything deserving of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing in these things of which these men accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, You have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And after some days King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when they had been there many days, Festus set forth Pauls case before the king, saying: There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, when I was in Jerusalem, asking for a judgment against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>To them I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to make a defense concerning the charge against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore when they had come together, without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation against him of such things as I supposed,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>but had some questions against him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And because I was uncertain of such questions, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But when Paul appealed to be reserved for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Caesar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Agrippa said to Festus, I also would like to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, he said, you shall hear him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at Festus command Paul was led out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Festus said: King Agrippa and all the men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom the whole assembly of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he was not fit to live any longer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But when I found that he had committed nothing deserving of death, and that he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>But I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I may have something to write.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
