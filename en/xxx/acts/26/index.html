So Paul stretched out his hand and answered for himself:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because today I shall give a defense before you concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which have to do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>They knew me from the first, if they were willing to bear witness, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>To this promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Why should it be thought incredible by you if God raises the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Indeed, I myself thought I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>This I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>While thus occupied, as I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from Heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So I said, Who are You, Sir? And He said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But arise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things in which I will appear to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I will deliver you from the Jewish people, as well as from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the Heavenly vision,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>but declared first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and do works befitting repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said would come to be;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>that the Christ would suffer, that He would be the first to rise from the dead, and would proclaim light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself! Much learning is driving you mad!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and sobriety.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For the king, before whom I also speak freely, knows these things; for I am convinced that none of these things are hidden from him, since this thing was not done in a corner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you believe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then Agrippa said to Paul, You almost persuade me to become a Christian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Paul said, I would to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and when they had gone aside, they talked among themselves, saying, This man is doing nothing deserving of death or bonds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
