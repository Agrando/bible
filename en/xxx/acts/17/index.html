When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily, to see whether these things are so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, both prominent women and men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the Word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the crowds.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away, to go as though toward the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him quickly, they departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, What does this empty talker want to say? And others, He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign demons, because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which you speak?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you fear the gods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your devotion, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One to whom you show reverence without knowing, Him I proclaim to you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Nor is He served with mens hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell everywhere on the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for in Him we live and move and exist, as also some of your own poets have said, For we are also His offspring.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine is like gold or silver or stone, something engraved by art and mans devising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>because He has established a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has appointed. He has given assurance of this to everyone by raising Him from the dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some ridiculed, while others said, We will hear you again concerning this matter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Paul departed from their midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
