And behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>He was well spoken of by the brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Paul wanted to have him go on with him. And he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in that region, for they all knew that his father was Greek.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number day by day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the Word in Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: A man of Macedonia stood and begged him, saying, Come over to Macedonia and help us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day came to Neapolis,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and from there to Philippi, which is the principal city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who assembled there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who revered God. The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when she and her household were immersed, she begged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay. So she persuaded us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortunetelling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And this she did for many days. But Paul, greatly disturbed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out that very instant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And they brought them to the magistrates, and said, These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>and they proclaim customs which are not lawful for us to receive or observe, being Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the multitude rose up against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyoneÂ’s bonds were loosened.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the jailer, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes. And immediately he and all his family were immersed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, believing in God with all his household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the floggers, saying, Let those men go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>So the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, being Romans, and have thrown us into prison. And now do they drive us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and lead us out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the floggers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Then they came and begged them and brought them out, and asked them to depart out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>So they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
