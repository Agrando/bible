And when the Jews plotted against him as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Sopater of Berea accompanied him to Asia; also Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>These men, going ahead, waited for us at Troas.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days came to them at Troas, where we stayed seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them and continued his message until midnight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And there were many lamps in the upper room where they were gathered together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep. He was overcome by sleep; and as Paul continued speaking, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But Paul went down, fell on him, and embracing him said, Do not be troubled, for his life is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now when he had come up, had broken bread and eaten, and talked a long while, even till daybreak, he departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And they brought the young man in alive, and they were not a little comforted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, there intending to take Paul on board; for so it was arranged, intending himself to go on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And we sailed from there, and the next day came opposite Chios. And the following day we arrived at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The next day we came to Miletus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>So, from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And when they had come to him, he said to them: You know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I lived among you all the time,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>testifying both to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And behold now, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore I testify to you this day that I am blameless from the blood of everyone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For I have not shrunk back from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For I know this, that after my departure vicious wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>So now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the Word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>I have coveted no ones silver or gold or apparel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Yes, you yourselves know that these hands have served for my necessities, and for those who were with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>I have shown you in everything, by laboring like this, that we need to support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Then they all wept greatly, and fell on Pauls neck and kissed him again and again,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
