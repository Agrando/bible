we hear them speaking in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So they were all amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, Whatever would this wish to be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Others mocking said, They are full of sweet wine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But Peter, standing up with the eleven, raised his voice and said to them, Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and listen to my words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For these are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out from My Spirit upon all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days; and they shall prophesy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>I will present wonders in the heavens above and signs in the earth beneath: blood and fire and vapor of smoke.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass that everyone who shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a Man approved by God to you by works of power, wonders, and signs which God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves also know;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Him, being delivered by the determined purpose and foreknowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>whom God raised up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for Him to be held by it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For David says concerning Him: I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for He is at my right hand, that I not be shaken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Therefore my heart rejoices, and my tongue is glad; moreover my flesh also dwells in hope.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For You will not leave My soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>You have made known to me the ways of life; You will make me full of joy in Your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Men and brethren, let me speak freely to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his body, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>he, foreseeing this, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>This Jesus, God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Therefore being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For David did not ascend into Heaven, but he says himself: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>until I make Your enemies Your footstool.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Therefore let all the house of Israel understand with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Now when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Peter said to them, Repent, and let every one of you be immersed in the name of Jesus Christ to the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Then those who gladly received his word were immersed; and that day about three thousand souls were added.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>And they continued steadfastly in the apostlesÂ’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs took place through the apostles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>Now all the believers were together, and had all things in common,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them to each person, as anyone had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>So continuing day by day with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
