And they understood that they were with Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>saying, What shall we do to these men? For indeed, that a notable sign has been done through them is evident to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we are not able to deny it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But so that it spreads no further among the people, let us threaten them with a threat, that from now on they speak to no one in this name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For we are not able not to speak the things which we have seen and heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way of punishing them, because of the people, since they all glorified God for what had been done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For the man was over forty years old on whom this sign of healing had been performed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And being let go, they went to their own companions and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one accord and said: Lord, You are God, who made the heavens and earth and the sea, and all that is in them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>who by the mouth of Your servant David have said: Why did the nations rage, and the people devise vain things?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers themselves were gathered against the Lord and against His Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For truly against Your holy Son Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And now, Lord, look on their threats, and grant to Your servants to speak Your Word with all boldness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>by stretching out Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of Your holy Son Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the Word of God with boldness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the multitude of those believing were of one heart and one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And with great power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Nor was there anyone needy among them; for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>and placed them at the apostles feet; and they distributed to each as anyone had need.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And Joses, who was surnamed Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>having land, sold it, and brought the money and placed it at the apostles feet.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
