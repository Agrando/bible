This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into Heaven, will so come in like manner as you have seen Him go into Heaven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath dayÂ’s journey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And when they had entered, they went up into the upper room where they were staying: Peter, Jacob, John, and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; Jacob of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas of Jacob.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Men and brethren, this Scripture needed to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who took Jesus;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>(Now this man procured a field out of the wages of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails poured out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field is called in their own language, Akeldama; that is, Field of Blood.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it is written in the book of Psalms: Let his dwelling place become desolate, and let him not live in it; and, Let another take his office.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>beginning from the immersion of John until the day when He was taken up from us, it is necessary for one of these to become a witness with us of His resurrection.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they proposed two: Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And they prayed and said, You, O Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which of these two You have chosen</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>to take part in this ministry and apostleship which Judas abandoned, that he might go to his own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they cast their lots, and the lot fell on Matthias.
