His mothers name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>He sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and in the days that he sought Jehovah, God made him prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And he went out and made war against the Philistines, and broke down the wall of Gath, the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod; and he built cities around Ashdod and among the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who lived in Gur-Baal, and against the Meunim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The Ammonites also brought tribute to Uzziah. His fame spread as far as the entrance of Egypt, for he became exceedingly strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the corner of the wall, and fortified them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>He also built towers in the wilderness, and dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the lowlands and in the plains; he also had farmers and vinedressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved the soil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Moreover Uzziah had forces making war who went out to war by divisions, according to the number of their muster by the hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the officer, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the kings commanders.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The total number of heads of fathers of the mighty men of valor was two thousand six hundred.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And under their hand was a military force of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Uzziah provided for them, for the entire army, shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and stones for the slings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he made devices in Jerusalem, invented by skillful men, to be on the towers and the corners, to shoot arrows and large stones. And his fame spread far and wide, for he was marvelously helped till he became strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when he was strong his heart was lifted up, to his destruction, for he transgressed against Jehovah his God to enter the temple of Jehovah to burn incense on the altar of incense.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him were eighty priests of Jehovah; valiant men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they withstood King Uzziah, and said to him, It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense unto Jehovah, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have trespassed! You shall have no honor from Jehovah God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Uzziah became enraged; and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense. And while he was angry with the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead, before the priests in the house of Jehovah, beside the incense altar.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked towards him, and behold, on his forehead he was leprous; so they hurried him out of that place. Indeed he also hurried to get out, because Jehovah had struck him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death. He dwelt in a separate house, because he was a leper; for he was cut off from the house of Jehovah. And Jotham his son was over the kings house, judging the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, from first to last, the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz has written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Uzziah rested with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of burial which belonged to the kings, for they said, He is a leper. And Jotham his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
