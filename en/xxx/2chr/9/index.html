You exceed the reports which I have heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Happy are your men and happy are these your servants, who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Blessed is Jehovah your God, who has delighted in you, setting you on His throne to be king for Jehovah your God. In your Gods love for Israel, to establish them forever, He has made you king over them, to do justice and righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold, spices in great abundance, and precious stones; there had never been any spices such as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Also, the servants of Huram and the servants of Solomon, who brought gold from Ophir, brought algum wood and precious stones.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the king made terraces of the algum wood for the house of Jehovah and for the kings house, also harps and lutes for the singers; and there had never before been seen such as these in the land of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all she desired, whatever she asked, besides what she had brought to the king. So she turned and went to her own land, she and her servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>besides what the traveling merchants and traders brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He also made three hundred shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. The king put them in the house of the Forest of Lebanon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne; there were armrests on either side of the place of the seat, with two lions standing beside the armrests.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Twelve lions stood there, one on each side of the six steps; nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>All King Solomons drinking vessels were gold, and all the vessels of the house of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. Not one was silver, for it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For the kings ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram. Once every three years the ships came from Tarshish, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Each man brought his present: articles of silver and gold, garments, weapons, spices, horses, and mules, the matter year by year.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he reigned over all the kings from the River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as abundant as the sycamores which are in the lowland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they brought horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all lands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Solomon rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
