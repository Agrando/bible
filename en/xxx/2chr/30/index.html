The priests and the Levites were ashamed, and consecrated themselves, and brought the burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They stood in their place according to the ordinance, according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests were sprinkling the blood from the hand of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For many in the assembly had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had charge of the slaughter of the Passover for everyone who was not clean, to consecrate them to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, O good Jehovah, provide atonement for everyone</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who has prepared his heart to seek God, Jehovah the God of his fathers, though not according to the purification of the sanctuary.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Jehovah gave heed to Hezekiah and healed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So the children of Israel found at Jerusalem kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy; and the Levites and the priests were praising Jehovah day by day, with loud instruments unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites who were teaching the good understanding of Jehovah; and they ate throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings and making confession unto Jehovah the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the whole assembly took counsel to keep the feast another seven days, and they kept it another seven days with joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezekiah king of Judah had given to the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the rulers had given to the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep; and a great number of priests consecrated themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The whole assembly of Judah rejoiced, along with the priests and Levites, all the assembly that came from Israel, the sojourners who came from the land of Israel, and those dwelling in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the priests, the Levites, rose up and blessed the people, and their voice was heard; and their prayer came up to His holy dwelling place, to the heavens.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
