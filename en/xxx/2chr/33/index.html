He did much evil in the eyes of Jehovah, to provoke Him to anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he set a graven image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name always;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and I will not again remove the foot of Israel from the land which I have appointed for your fathers; only if they take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according to the whole Law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of Moses.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Manasseh caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go astray, to do more evil than the nations whom Jehovah had destroyed before the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they would not listen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore Jehovah brought upon them the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze fetters, and carried him off to Babylon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And when he was in distress, he entreated Jehovah his God, and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and prayed to Him; and He was entreated of him, heard his supplication, and brought him back to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh recognized that Jehovah was God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>After this he built a wall outside the City of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, as far as the entrance of the Fish Gate; and it encircled Ophel, and he raised it to a very great height. And he stationed commanders of the forces in all the fortified cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>He took away the foreign gods and the idol out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah and in Jerusalem; and he cast them out of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He also repaired the altar of Jehovah, sacrificed peace offerings and thank offerings on it, and commanded Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>However the people still sacrificed on the high places; nevertheless to Jehovah their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Also his prayer and his entreaty, and all his sin and unfaithfulness, and the places where he built high places and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled, behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So Manasseh rested with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house. And his son Amon reigned in his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, as his father Manasseh had done; for Amon sacrificed to all the graven images which his father Manasseh had made, and served them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he did not humble himself before Jehovah, as his father Manasseh had humbled himself, but Amon exceeded his guilt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then his servants conspired against him, and killed him in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the people of the land executed all those who had conspired against King Amon. And the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
