And Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Your father made our yoke heavy; now therefore, lighten the burdensome service of your father and his heavy yoke which he has put on us, and we will serve you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he said to them, Come back to me after three days. And the people departed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And King Rehoboam consulted the elders who stood before his father Solomon while he still lived, saying, How do you advise me to answer these people?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And they spoke to him, saying, If you are kind to the people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But he rejected the counsel which the elders had given him, and consulted the young men who had grown up with him, who stood before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he said to them, What advice do you give? How should we answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, Lighten the yoke which your father had put on us?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus you should speak to the people who have spoken to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter on us; thus you shall say to them: My little finger shall be thicker than my fatherÂ’s loins!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And now, whereas my father put a heavy yoke on you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had spoken, saying, Come back to me the third day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the elders,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So the king did not consent to the people; for the turn of events was from God, that Jehovah might fulfill His word, which He had spoken by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And when all Israel saw that the king did not consent to them, the people answered the king, saying: What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now see to your own house, O David! And all Israel departed to their tents.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Rehoboam reigned over the children of Israel dwelling in the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the labor force; but the sons of Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. So King Rehoboam mounted his chariot in haste to flee to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thus Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
