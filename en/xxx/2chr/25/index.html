His mothers name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he did what was right in the eyes of Jehovah, but not with a perfect heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now it happened, when the kingdom had been secured to him, that he executed his servants who had killed his father the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>However he did not execute their children, but did as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses, where Jehovah had commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for their sons, nor shall the sons be put to death for their fathers; but each shall die for his own sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds, according to their fathers houses, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above, and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men, able to go to war, handling spear and shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valor from Israel for one hundred talents of silver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But a man of God came to him, saying, O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for Jehovah is not with Israel; with any of the sons of Ephraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>But if you do go, do it. Be strong in battle. But even so, God shall make you stumble before the enemy; for God has power to help and to overthrow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do about the hundred talents which I have given to the troops of Israel? And the man of God answered, Jehovah has much more than this to give you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim, to go back to their place. Therefore their anger burned greatly against Judah, and they returned to their place in burning anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led his people and went to the Valley of Salt and killed ten thousand of the sons of Seir.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the sons of Judah took captive ten thousand alive, brought them to the top of the rock, and cast them down from the top of the rock, so that they all were ripped to pieces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But as for the troops which Amaziah had dismissed, so that they should not go with him to battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon, killed three thousand in them, and plundered much spoils.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came about, after Amaziah came from the slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the children of Seir, set them up to be his gods, and bowed down before them and burned incense to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Therefore the anger of Jehovah burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, Why have you sought the gods of the people, which could not rescue their own people from your hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So it was, as he spoke with him, that the king said to him, Have we made you the kings counselor? Stop! Why should you be killed? So the prophet stopped, and said, I know that God has given counsel to destroy you, because you have done this and have not heeded my counsel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Now Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent to Joash the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look each other in the face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give your daughter to my son as wife; and a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Behold, you say that you have struck the Edomites, and your heart is lifted up to boast. Stay at home now; why should you excite yourself to evil, that you should fall; you and Judah with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But Amaziah would not listen, for it was from God, to deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had resorted to the gods of Edom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So Joash king of Israel went out; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face at Beth Shemesh, which belongs to Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Judah was struck down before Israel, and every man fled to his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Joash the king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth Shemesh; and he brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate; four hundred cubits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he took all the gold and silver, all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom, the treasures of the kings house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Amaziah the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from first to last, behold, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>After the time that Amaziah turned away from following Jehovah, they conspired treason against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and killed him there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And they brought him on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
