My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Nevertheless they shall be his servants, that they may distinguish between My service and the service of the kingdoms of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the kings house; he took everything. He also carried away the gold shields which Solomon had made.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then King Rehoboam made bronze shields in their place, and committed them to the hands of the commanders of the runners, who guarded the doorway of the kings house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And whenever the king entered the house of Jehovah, the runners went and brought them out; then they returned them to the guardroom.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When he humbled himself, the wrath of Jehovah turned back from him, so as not to destroy him completely; and also, conditions were good in Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Thus Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Now Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which Jehovah had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put His name there. His mothers name was Naamah, an Ammonitess.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he did evil, because he had not fixed his heart to seek Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies. And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So Rehoboam rested with his fathers, and was buried in the City of David. And Abijah his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
