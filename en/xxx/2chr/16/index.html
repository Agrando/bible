Behold, I have sent you silver and gold; come, break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel, so that he will withdraw from me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Ben-Hadad heeded King Asa, and sent the commanders of his forces against the cities of Israel; and they struck Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities of Naphtali.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And it happened, when Baasha heard it, that he stopped building Ramah and ceased his work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones and timber of Ramah, which Baasha had used for building; and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and said to him: Because you have leaned on the king of Syria, and have not trusted on Jehovah your God, therefore the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Were the Ethiopians and the Lubim not a huge army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you trusted on Jehovah, He delivered them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the eyes of Jehovah run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show Himself strong for those whose hearts are perfect toward Him. In this you have done foolishly; therefore from now on there will be wars for you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then Asa was angry with the seer, and put him in the prison house, for he was enraged at him for this; and Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And so, the acts of Asa, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And in the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa became diseased in his feet, and his sickness was severe; yet in his sickness he did not seek Jehovah, but the physicians.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And they buried him in his own tomb, which he had made for himself in the City of David; and they laid him in the bed which was filled with spices and various ingredients prepared in a mixture of ointments; and they made a very great burning for him.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
