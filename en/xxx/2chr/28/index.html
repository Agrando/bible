They struck him, and carried away a great multitude of them as captives, and brought them to Damascus. Then he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who struck him down with a great slaughter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed one hundred and twenty thousand in Judah in one day, all valiant men, because they had forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the kingÂ’s son, Azrikam the officer over the house, and Elkanah who was second to the king.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the sons of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women, sons, and daughters; and they also took away much spoils from them, and brought the spoils to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>But a prophet of Jehovah was there, whose name was Oded; and he went out before the army that came to Samaria, and said to them: Behold, because Jehovah the God of your fathers was angry with Judah, He has delivered them into your hand; but you have killed them in a rage that reaches up to the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And now you propose to subject the children of Judah and Jerusalem to be your male and female slaves; but do you not also have guilt of your own before Jehovah your God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now listen to me, therefore, and return the captives, whom you have taken captive from your brethren, for the fierce wrath of Jehovah is upon you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then some of the heads of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai, stood up against those who came from the war,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>and said to them, You shall not bring the captives here, for we are already guilty before Jehovah. You intend to add to our sins and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the armed men left the captives and the spoils before the rulers and all the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Then the men who were designated by name rose up and took the captives, and from the spoils they clothed all who were naked among them, dressed them and gave them sandals, gave them food and drink, and anointed them; and they let all the feeble ones ride on donkeys. So they brought them to their brethren at Jericho, the city of palm trees; and returned to Samaria.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>At that time King Ahaz had sent to the king of Assyria to help him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for again the Edomites had come, struck Judah, and carried away captives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the lowland and of the south of Judah, and had taken Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Sochoh with its daughter-villages, Timnah with its daughter-villages, and Gimzo with its daughter-villages; and dwelt there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For Jehovah had humbled Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he had led Judah into lack of restraints, and to trespass in unfaithfulness unto Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to him and distressed him, and did not help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For Ahaz took part of the treasures from the house of Jehovah, from the house of the king, and from the rulers, and he gave it to the king of Assyria; but he did not help him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And in the time of his distress he became increasingly unfaithful to Jehovah; this King Ahaz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had struck him, saying, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, I will sacrifice to them that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So Ahaz gathered the vessels of the house of God, cut in pieces the utensils of the house of God, shut up the doors of the house of Jehovah, and made for himself altars in every corner of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And in every single city of Judah he made high places to burn incense to other gods, and provoked to anger Jehovah the God of his fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from first to last, behold they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>So Ahaz rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem; but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. And Hezekiah his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
