For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, were standing before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Then the Spirit of Jehovah came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said, Give attention, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, O King Jehoshaphat. Thus says Jehovah to you: Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but Gods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Tomorrow go down against them. Behold, they are coming up by the ascent of Ziz, and you shall find them at the end of the valley before the wilderness of Jeruel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>You shall not fight in this battle. Station yourselves, stand your ground and see the salvation of Jehovah for you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out before them, for Jehovah is with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before Jehovah to prostrate themselves before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the Levites of the sons of the Kohathites and of the sons of the Korahites stood up to praise Jehovah the God of Israel with loud voices on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>So they rose early in the morning and went out into the wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Listen to me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Trust in Jehovah your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing unto Jehovah, and who should praise the glory of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying: Give thanks unto Jehovah, for His mercy is eternal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when they began to cry out in songs of praise, Jehovah set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were smitten.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For the sons of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir to utterly kill and destroy them. And when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So when Judah had come to the lookout point at the wilderness, they looked toward the multitude; and behold, the corpses, fallen to the earth. No one had escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to plunder the spoils, they found among them an abundance of property on the corpses, with precious jewelry, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days plundering the spoils because there was so much.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Berachah, for there they blessed Jehovah; therefore the name of that place was called The Valley of Berachah to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at the head of them, to go back to Jerusalem with joy; for Jehovah had made them rejoice over their enemies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So they came to Jerusalem, with lutes and harps and trumpets, to the house of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of the lands when they heard that Jehovah had fought against the enemies of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest all around.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>So Jehoshaphat was king over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he walked in the way of his father Asa, and did not turn aside from it, to do what was right in the eyes of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Nevertheless the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not fixed their hearts to the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, which is brought up in the book of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah had made an alliance with Ahaziah king of Israel, who acted very wickedly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And he allied himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion Geber.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>But Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, Jehovah has broken your works. And the ships were wrecked, so that they were not able to go to Tarshish.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
