Thus the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The priests were stationed at their posts; the Levites also with instruments of song unto Jehovah, (which King David had made to give praise unto Jehovah, saying, For His mercy is eternal, whenever David offered praise by their hand), and the priests sounded trumpets opposite them, while all Israel were standing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Furthermore Solomon consecrated the middle of the court that was in front of the house of Jehovah; for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the fat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>At that time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly from the entrance of Hamath to the Brook of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, for they observed the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away to their tents, joyful and glad of heart for the good that Jehovah had done to David, to Solomon, and to His people Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Thus Solomon finished the house of Jehovah and the kingÂ’s house; and Solomon brought to successful conclusion all that came into his heart to make in the house of Jehovah and in his own house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And Jehovah appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him: I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When I shut up the heavens and there is no rain, or command the locusts to devour the land, or send pestilence among My people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>if My people who have been called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from the heavens, and will forgive their sin and heal their land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now My eyes will be open and My ears attentive to prayers of this place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For now I have chosen and consecrated this house, that My name may be there always; and My eyes and My heart shall be there all the days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David has walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and keep My statutes and My judgments,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I have covenanted with David your father, saying, You shall not fail to have a man ruling in Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But if you turn back and have forsaken My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed down to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>then I will uproot them from My land which I have given them; and this house which I have consecrated for My name I will cast out from before My face, and will make it a proverb and a byword among all peoples.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as for this lofty house, everyone who passes by it will be appalled and say, Why has Jehovah done thus to this land and this house?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then they will answer, Because they have forsaken Jehovah the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and taken hold on other gods, and bowed down to them and served them; therefore He has brought all this evil upon them.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
