Therefore wrath is upon you from before Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Nevertheless good things have been found in you, in that you have burned the groves from the land, and have fixed your heart to seek God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he appointed judges throughout the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and said to the judges, Take heed to what you are doing, for you do not judge for man but for Jehovah, who is with you in the words of judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Now therefore, let the fear of Jehovah be upon you; take heed and do it, for there is no injustice with Jehovah our God, no partiality, nor taking of bribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Moreover in Jerusalem, for the judgment of Jehovah and for disputes, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the chief fathers of Israel of the Levites and priests, who were brought back to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And he commanded them, saying, You shall do this in the fear of Jehovah, in faithfulness and with a perfect heart:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Whatever case comes to you from your brethren who dwell in their cities, whether of bloodshed or offenses against Law or commandment, against statutes or ordinances, you shall warn them, that they not trespass against Jehovah and wrath come upon you and your brethren. Do this, and you shall not be guilty.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the kingÂ’s matters; also the Levites will be officials before you.
