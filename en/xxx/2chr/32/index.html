And the people were bolstered by the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>After this, Sennacherib king of Assyria sent his servants to Jerusalem (but he and all the forces with him laid siege against Lachish), to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were in Jerusalem, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: In what are you trusting, that you remain under siege in Jerusalem?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Is not Hezekiah enticing you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assyria?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Has not the same Hezekiah taken away His high places and His altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, You shall bow down before one altar and burn incense on it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed was able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Now therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you nor entice you like this, and do not believe him; for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Furthermore, his servants spoke against Jehovah God and against His servant Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He had also written letters to reproach Jehovah the God of Israel, and to speak against Him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people from my hand, so the God of Hezekiah will not deliver His people from my hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then they called out with a loud voice in the Jewish language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and terrify them, that they might capture the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem, as against the gods of the peoples of the lands; the work of menÂ’s hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Now because of this King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried out to the heavens.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jehovah sent an angel who cut down every mighty man of valor, rulers, and commanders in the camp of the king of Assyria. So he returned shamefaced to his own land. And when he went into the house of his god, he fell by the sword of some of the offspring of his own body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Thus Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all others, and guided them on every side.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And many brought gifts unto Jehovah at Jerusalem, and choice things to Hezekiah king of Judah, so that he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations thereafter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death, and he prayed to Jehovah; and He spoke to him and gave him a sign.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But Hezekiah did not return according to the favor shown him, for his heart had become haughty; therefore wrath was over him and over Judah and Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the haughtiness of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of Jehovah did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Hezekiah had very great riches and honor. And he made himself treasuries for silver, for gold, for precious stones, for spices, for shields, and for all kinds of desirable objects;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>storehouses for the harvest of grain, wine, and oil; and stalls for all kinds of livestock, and folds for flocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Moreover he provided cities for himself, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance; for God had given him very much property.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>This same Hezekiah also stopped the water outlet of upper Gihon, and brought the water by tunnel to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his pursuits.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>However, regarding the ambassadors of the rulers of Babylon, who were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him alone, to test him, to know all his heart.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>So Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and they buried him in the upper tombs of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
